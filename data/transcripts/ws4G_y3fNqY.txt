[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   I should like to call your attention this afternoon to the sequel to the history, the
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.240]   account of which has already been read to us out of the first book of Samuel in chapter
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.400]   four, the first 18 verses. I'm going to start reading at the 19th verse and go on to the
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:29.960]   end of the chapter. And his daughter-in-law, that's to say Eli, the high priest's daughter-in-law,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.880]   his daughter-in-law, Phineas' wife, was with child near to be delivered. And when she heard
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.120]   the tidings that the ark of God was taken and that her father-in-law and her husband
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.600]   were dead, she bowed herself and traveled, for her pains came upon her. And about the
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.960]   time of her death, the women that stood by her said unto her, "Fear not, for there was
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.760]   born a son." But she answered not, neither did she regard it. And she named the child
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:16.880]   Ichabod, saying, "The glory is departed from Israel, because the ark of God was taken and
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:26.320]   because of her father-in-law and her husband." And she said, "The glory is departed from
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:36.000]   Israel, for the ark of God is taken." And I want to consider that in the light of another
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.960]   bit of history that we are given in the last chapter, chapter 40 of the book of Exodus.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:53.000]   And let me read again verses 33, 34, and 35 in that 40th chapter of the book of Exodus.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.640]   And he rode up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar and set up the hanging of the
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:07.760]   court gate. So Moses finished the work. Then a cloud gathered, then a cloud covered the
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:15.520]   tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. And Moses
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:23.200]   was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon,
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:32.000]   and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. Now in this history that we have here in the
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.840]   first book of Samuel in chapter 4, we have an account, as you noticed, and as I'm sure
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.760]   most of you recall, of one of those periods in the history of the children of Israel,
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.800]   the people of God, when they had sunk, perhaps to one of the lowest levels that they ever
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.240]   sank. The story of these people, as it's given to us in the Old Testament, is a very
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.960]   checkered one and a very uneven one. Great and marvelous days, then followed by days
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.920]   of declension and of decay. And here in this chapter, we see them as it were at their very
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:20.400]   lowest. They'd fallen and failed in almost every respect, in a military sense, in a moral
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:28.800]   sense, and still more important, in a religious and in a spiritual sense. It's a picture of
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:38.640]   desolation and of well-nigh hopelessness. God's people write down on the cause of God
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.400]   apparently utterly defeated and routed by the enemy. Now that's the picture that we
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.880]   have there, and it's the picture that I want to consider with you this afternoon. And unfortunately,
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.060]   there is no need for me to explain why I'm calling your attention to this particular
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:06.000]   incident, for we are living again in days of declension. There's no argument about this.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.520]   The statistics and everything else demonstrate this beyond any doubt whatsoever. We find
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:23.080]   ourselves in evil times with the cause, with the Church of God in defeat, dismissed, derided,
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.880]   laughed at by the vast majority of people. And of course, this is, as I say, recognized
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:37.560]   and recognized freely. And not only is it recognized, but various people in the churches
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.040]   have been giving a great deal of time and attention and energy to attempting something
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.080]   which can deal with this situation and restore the Church to a position of influence and
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.800]   power which it once held in this country. I'm not going to wear you by telling you of
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.400]   the various methods and means that have been adopted. Whatever else may be said about the
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.920]   Church in this century, nobody can judge it with inactivity. Never, perhaps, has the Church
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.800]   been more active than she's been in this present century. She's been prepared to look to the
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:19.640]   world and its methods, borrow ideas from big business, borrow ideas from anybody or anything
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:26.880]   in order to try to attract and to interest and to hold the attention of the people. But
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.280]   I think the time has arrived when we must begin to ask certain questions. What's all
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.000]   this leading to? The Church has tried drama, pop music, entertainments of various description.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.880]   There's scarcely anything that she's not prepared to do. But the position continues to deteriorate
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.000]   and to go from bad to worse. So the great question confronting us today, if we are concerned
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.720]   about these things, is this. What can we do? And I suggest to you this afternoon that the
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:05.840]   first thing we have to do is really to discover the cause of our troubles. Why are things
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.780]   as they are? I see no hope for us until we start with that. The tendency of people is
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.160]   to start with methods of improving the condition. I've often pointed out that it's a very poor
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.680]   doctor who begins to treat a patient before he's discovered what it is wrong with his
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.920]   patient. Diagnosis must come first if you are to have the right and the appropriate
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:37.200]   treatment. And this is particularly important in the realm of the Church. And of course
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.440]   we have the answer in the Bible. The Bible is an account of the people of God. You get
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.320]   it in the Old Testament, the children of Israel, the Church in the New Testament. And as I
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:55.840]   say, we see these variations and yet we see the cause of the trouble perfectly delineated.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:03.200]   And at the same time we are led to the only true remedy. And it is because I think that
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.880]   is shown us so plainly and clearly in this incident, and especially when we take it in
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.800]   connection with that other incident in the last book of Exodus. It's only as we do this,
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.800]   I think, that we shall arrive at a true understanding. You see, there in the book of Exodus, we see
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.600]   the glory coming upon the Church. Here in the first book of Samuel, we see the glory
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.640]   departing. Now there are the two positions. What is it the Bible teaches us with regard
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:41.240]   to all this? Well now, the first principle I find is this. That the most vital and important
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:52.400]   thing in the life of the Church is the realization of the presence of the glory of God. That
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:08:00.160]   is the most important thing in connection with the life of the Church. The awareness,
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:09.720]   the realization of the presence and the glory of God. That's emphasized in this last chapter
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:18.000]   of Exodus. It's emphasized here. It comes, it goes. Nothing is more important than this.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.560]   Now this is something that you needn't take at my word. The Apostle Paul, he states this
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.800]   very plainly in his epistle to the Romans. You remember at the beginning of chapter 9,
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.200]   he bemoans the fact that his fellow countrymen, the Jews, were of all people the ones who
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.440]   were rejecting the gospel. And why does he regret it? Well he tells us in verse 4, "Who
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:50.640]   are Israelites, to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory." That's it. The presence of
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:57.720]   God. The glory. And the covenants and the giving of the law and so on. But you notice
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:05.480]   that he puts emphasis there upon the glory. And the glory means, of course, the presence
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:12.240]   of God. And as you read the history of the children of Israel in the Old Testament, you
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.960]   will see that this was always the determining factor. They were not a great nation, judged
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:26.240]   in a human sense, either in numbers or in military prowess or military ability. And
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:32.400]   yet they had some amazing and astonishing victories over mighty enemies. What accounted
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.320]   for it? It was always the presence of God. But then you have these other pictures of
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:46.640]   the same people in defeat and in abject misery. What accounts for that? Oh, it's the absence
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:55.000]   of the presence of God and of his glory. When God was among them, these people were invincible,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.960]   though they were a comparatively small nation. But when God was not with them, they were
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:08.760]   the weakest and in a sense the most contemptible of all the nations and the peoples. So the
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:19.120]   big factor, the determining factor, was this consciousness and realization of the presence
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:27.520]   and the glory of God. Now in the Old Testament, the glory, the presence of God, was something
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:37.000]   that was visible in a true visual sense. You remember the construction of the tabernacle
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.240]   in the wilderness or afterwards the temple. The old tabernacle was something like this
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:48.200]   building except that it was divided off into compartments. There was a kind of outer court,
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.040]   an outer compartment where anybody could enter. Then there was a veil, and then there was
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.440]   a court of the people where the Jews alone could enter. Then there was another curtain,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:03.080]   another veil, and you came to a court where the priests alone could enter. It was known
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:10.320]   as the holy place. And then there was another curtain, another veil, and beyond that was
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:18.120]   what was called the holiest of all. And why was it called that? Well, it was called that
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:26.160]   because that is where God came down, as it were, to meet the representative of the people.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.920]   He alone was allowed to enter, this holiest of all, and he alone was allowed to enter
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:39.840]   once a year. Why was this such a tremendous place? The answer is the glory of God was
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:47.120]   to be seen there. It was known as the Shekinah glory. There was a kind of light, a kind of
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:54.240]   luminosity. And so when this high priest went in once a year, the people were fearful and
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:00.280]   were filled with trembling. Why? Well, because he was going into the presence of God. And
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.440]   this was regarded by them as the greatest and the most amazing thing that could happen.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:12.200]   It was a fearful thing and an awe-inspiring thing. And it was all due to the fact that
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:21.840]   this Shekinah glory, the kind of visible representation of the presence of the holy and the eternal
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:28.600]   God was there. Well, now, that's the glory that these texts are speaking about. Now,
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:35.320]   in our age, in our dispensation, we don't know about the Shekinah glory. We don't look
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:42.760]   for this or know about this in our buildings. But the same principle is true. And still
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.240]   it is true to say that the most important people, most important thing for God's people,
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:53.020]   for the children of God, for the church, is the realization of the presence of the glory
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:59.520]   of God. How do we know this? And the answer again is given by the Apostle Paul. "God,"
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:05.360]   he says, "who commended the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:14.280]   to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:21.640]   And this is mediated to us by the Holy Spirit so that it is possible for us to know and
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:29.340]   to realize the glory and the presence of the glory of God as much as it was for the people
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:34.400]   under the Old Testament dispensation. And that is why I say that the most important
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.760]   thing of all for every individual Christian or for the life of the whole church is the
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:49.180]   awareness and the realization of this glorious presence. That, my friends, is what makes
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:57.320]   the difference between religion and Christianity. That's the difference between practicing
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:09.640]   religion and spiritual worship, the realization of the presence of the glory of God. And to
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:15.760]   me the alarming thing is this, that it is possible for us to have so much and to do
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:25.040]   so much and yet miss this glory. And if we miss this, all that we have is more or less
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:31.520]   entirely useless. Now what do I mean by saying that it's possible for us to have so much?
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.540]   Well now let me show you that by taking you to that 40th chapter of the book of Exodus,
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:45.420]   which is the most interesting chapter. It gives us a kind of summary of the erection
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:54.460]   of the tabernacle in the wilderness amongst the Jews, the children of Israel. And it's
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:59.660]   a chapter that can be divided into a number of sections. The first section runs roughly
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:06.620]   through the first 16 verses. And it's something like this. The Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.020]   Now then, on the first day of the first month thou shalt set up the tabernacle of the tent
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:16.220]   of the congregation, and on the instruction go. Thou shalt put therein the ark of the
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.980]   testimony, and cover the ark with the veil. Thou shalt bring in the table, on and on and
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:27.340]   on it goes, giving him detailed instructions as to what he was to do. And so it sums it
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:35.700]   up in verse 16 by saying, Thus did Moses according to all that the Lord commanded him, so he
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:44.180]   did. Now from there until you come to the end of verse 33, you get again an account
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:52.140]   in detail of how Moses carried out all these instructions to the letter. We've been given
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:58.620]   them in detail, the plans and the specifications. And then we are told that Moses proceeded
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:03.940]   to do this. It came to pass in the first month, in the second year, on the first day of the
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:09.540]   month, that the tabernacle was reared up. And Moses reared up the tabernacle and fastened
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:15.380]   his sockets and set up the boards thereof, and on and on and on it goes, until you come
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:23.500]   to that 33rd verse. And there at the end of that verse you read this, So Moses finished
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:31.340]   the work. Well, you see, there it is. Everything is done. Everything is absolutely perfect.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:36.940]   He'd received the detailed instructions, and he's carried them out every one and to the
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:42.020]   letter. And here is this wonderful building erected. Everything is in position. Everything
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:48.420]   is perfect. What more can you desire? And yet, you know, according to this history,
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:54.220]   though Moses had finished the work, the vital thing had not yet happened. Listen. Go on
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:17:03.020]   to the next verse, 34. After Moses had finished the work, then a cloud covered the tent of
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:10.620]   the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:15.340]   to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:20.700]   of the Lord filled the tabernacle. You see, my friends, you can have your tabernacle,
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:26.900]   but it's no use to you unless the glory of the Lord has descended upon it. And what I
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:34.820]   say alarms me is this, that you can have all this and still have nothing. And isn't this
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:40.500]   the real explanation of the tragic condition of the Christian church at the present time?
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.740]   We seem to have acted on the assumption, as long as we carry out certain detailed instructions,
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:52.540]   that we've done everything. Our emphasis has been upon men's action, upon Moses's action.
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:58.220]   Now I want to bring out this point. The tragedy is that people put their emphasis either entirely
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:05.460]   on Moses's work, or else entirely on God's action. Whereas the true teaching is that
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:11.820]   you must have both. There is the work that Moses is commended to do, and has to do, and
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:18.300]   must do. There is men's part in this, and the Bible tells us what it is. But we mustn't
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:24.660]   stop at this. And this has been the tragedy of this present century. The church has forgotten
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:30.820]   God. We put our emphasis on what? Well, in the earlier part of the century, and perhaps
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:36.100]   going back into the last century, it was an emphasis on scholarship. I'm not here to say
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:41.660]   a word against scholarship or education. Thank God for it. I had the privilege of having
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:48.500]   a little myself. Knowledge and learning are excellent. But the church, it seems to me,
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:55.260]   somewhere around about the middle of the last century, made a fatal turn. Until then, men
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:00.300]   and women in the church had looked to God and his glory and the power of the Spirit.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:05.260]   But now they began to say that people were educated and learned, and we needed an educated
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:12.980]   ministry. And the emphasis was placed increasingly upon knowledge and learning. And the qualifications
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:18.980]   desiderated in a prospective minister was not so much that he was filled with the Spirit
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:24.500]   as what were his degrees. Now, I'm not here to decry degrees. Don't misunderstand me.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:29.900]   There is a legitimate place for this. But I am suggesting that when you put your faith
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:35.580]   in learning and so-called scholarship, you're probably missing the most important thing
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:40.740]   of all, and then the emphasis on organization. Look at the committees and the commissions
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:45.740]   and the organizations the church has developed. They didn't have these, you know, 200 years
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:50.340]   ago. They didn't have them in the early church. But now everything's got to be organized.
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.980]   And literature poured out telling us what to do, and people have put their faith in
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:20:02.500]   organization. Oh, I mustn't wear you with a list of the things that we've been emphasizing.
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:07.020]   People have said that if only you have a new translation of the Bible, the problem's going
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:12.660]   to be solved. Well, we're getting them almost every week, but the position seems to be deteriorating.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.620]   Then they say we must interest and attract the people. We must give them various forms
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:22.700]   of entertainment. Drama has been brought in. Everything has been brought in. All this emphasis,
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:28.740]   you see, upon the activity of men. Now I'm ready to agree that men has his part and his
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:34.300]   portion, and this must be carried out. But on the other hand, there are friends who are
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:39.620]   not interested in any kind of organization. There are people who think it's ultra-spiritual
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:45.100]   not to belong to a church, not to have a church membership role, not to have any organization
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:50.740]   whatsoever, not to have any kind of learning or knowledge or instruction. They want constantly
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:57.740]   to have some kind of spiritual stimulus, some riot of the emotions. And so, you see, we
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:05.420]   go from one extreme to the other. But the alarming thing, as I say, is this, that you
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:13.900]   can have so much and yet in a spiritual sense have nothing. Though you have a good building,
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.420]   though you have a wealthy church, though you have an educated people and an educated ministry,
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:24.460]   though you multiply your organizations, if the glory of God is not in the midst, it will
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:31.500]   come to nothing and it will be finally and ultimately useless. So we have to learn the
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:37.220]   lesson of combining these two things. Shall I put it to you in the form of a story, an
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:42.740]   illustration I once heard an old preacher use? This was an old preacher who lived in
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:48.140]   the town of Swansea in South Wales. And I remember this man at the celebration of the
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:53.580]   bicentenary of the birth of Daniel Rowland, one of the great Welsh Methodist fathers of
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:58.380]   two hundred years ago. There had been about four previous speakers, then this old man
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:03.340]   was asked to speak. And this is what he told us. He really just told us this story. He
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:09.620]   said that taking a walk in his town one day, he began to see men digging the road up and
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.820]   he wondered what they were doing. And he found later that they were preparing to put some
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.980]   rails down. And eventually he saw them putting the rails down. Then he saw them putting up
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:25.060]   great poles, one equally spaced here and there, right down the road. And he wondered what
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.780]   it was all about. Then another day he noticed that they were putting a cable from one pole
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:34.020]   to the other. And on and on he went with this story. And one day he went there and he saw
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:41.700]   a most magnificent carriage on these rails. It had got about six wheels, I think he said.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:45.740]   And there it was, beautifully painted. And you could go inside and you could sit on a
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:51.100]   seat and you could reverse the seat. It was beautifully painted and varnished. Everything
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:56.940]   seemed perfect. Wonderful carriage to sit in. Yes, but the carriage didn't move. And
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.180]   then a great day came, he said, when a member of the royal family went down from London
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:08.820]   to Swansea to open this new electric tramway system. And he was there and he said, this
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:13.420]   is all that happened. All the member of the royal family did, he said, was this. There
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:19.380]   was a pole on top of this carriage and it seemed to be tied down by something. And all
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:25.780]   this person did was to pull a cord and that released the pole. And immediately it shot
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:32.100]   up and made connection with that electric cable on the top of the pole. And from the
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:37.020]   moment that connection was made, the tram car began to move. You see, it was a perfect
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:43.140]   tram car before, but it didn't move. Yet the business of a tram car is to move. It's
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.060]   not just a place that you go and sit in in comfort. You enter a tram car in order that
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:51.860]   you may be taken somewhere. You've got a journey to make. But here it was, a perfect
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:59.100]   tram car in every respect. And yet it was motionless. And it remained motionless until
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:04.900]   this vital connection was made with the power that was in the electric cable. And he pointed
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:09.500]   out that all Daniel Rowland had done was to pull the cord and the connection had been
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.580]   made. He hadn't sent the car on. He just made the connection. And the power of the
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.820]   Holy Spirit provided the power necessary for the locomotion.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:23.660]   Well, now, here is the first great lesson as I see it. We may have everything that men
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:31.620]   can do, and yet it isn't a church. What makes a church a church is the presence of
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:38.460]   the glory and the power of God. Very well. That leads me to a second lesson, which is
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:45.420]   this, that the most important thing for us, therefore, individually and collectively,
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:53.300]   is to be sensitive to this presence of the glory and the power of God. Nothing is more
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:58.740]   important than that we should be sensitive to the presence of this glory. And that is
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:05.860]   why I call attention to this woman, the daughter-in-law of Eli, the wife of Phineas.
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:11.140]   Now, this is to me the great lesson of this particular incident. His daughter-in-law,
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:16.420]   Phineas's wife, was with child near to be delivered. And when she heard the tidings
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.700]   that the ark of God was taken and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:28.420]   bowed herself and traveled, for her pains came upon her. And about the time of her death,
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:33.920]   the women that stood by her said unto her, "Fear not, for there was born a son." But
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.900]   she answered not, neither did she regard it. And she called the name of the child, Echabod,
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:44.020]   saying, "The glory is departed from Israel." And what does all that mean? Well, this is
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:50.340]   what it means. Here was this woman about to give birth to her first child. And for an
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.940]   Israelite woman, nothing was more important or greater than to give birth to a child,
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:26:00.300]   and especially to a male child. You read of this often in the Old Testament. They looked
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:05.980]   for this. They longed for this. It was the height of their desire and their ambition.
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:12.300]   And so here is this woman about to give birth to her child, and gives birth to the child.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:18.980]   And the women that were with her were amazed that she was fearful. And they said to her,
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:25.620]   "Fear not, for there was born a son." They said, "Why are you looking so miserable? Don't
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.980]   you realize," they said, "that your great desire and longing have been gratified? You've
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:34.580]   given birth to a son. Cheer up," they said. "Rejoice. It's a time of rejoicing. Don't
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:42.660]   be fearful. Glory in the fact that you've given birth to a son." But she answered not.
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:49.460]   Neither did she regard it. Why not? Because she was a spiritually minded woman. The birth
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:55.220]   of a son, the greatest boon, the greatest blessing to this woman was nothing because
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:27:02.180]   the glory of the Lord had departed. Nothing compares with this. You can give her everything,
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:08.420]   the greatest thing of all. But if the glory of God has gone, she can't be happy. Why?
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:13.980]   Well because she's sensitive to the presence of the glory of God. Now, she stands out in
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:20.460]   this chapter as an exception. The chapter tells us that the old man Eli, who had been
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:29.060]   a good man in his early days, had become slack, indolent, too indulgent with his wicked sons.
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:35.780]   These two sons of Ishofni and Phinehas were evil men. They were abusing the priesthood
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:41.660]   to satisfy their own lusts and their own ambitions and their own greed. And the old man, instead
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:46.260]   of correcting them and turning them out, had indulged them and had excused them. He was
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:52.020]   largely responsible. He hadn't realized what was happening, that the glory was departing.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.460]   And they, of course, had never known it. And so, you see, the whole trouble with Israel
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:03.180]   was this terrible spiritual declension. They were interested in the externals, and they'd
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:12.860]   lost their sensitivity to the presence of the glory of God. But this woman hadn't. She
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:19.260]   was alive to this. And though she's given birth to a child, I say, it is no consolation
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:26.220]   to her. God has departed. She calls the child Ichabod. The glory has departed. The ark has
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:32.260]   been taken. It's a day of mourning and of weeping, not of rejoicing, though I've actually
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:38.300]   given birth to a son. Well, now, that is why I say that the most important thing for us
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:44.300]   is that we should be sensitive to the presence of the glory of God. You know, the Bible has
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:50.180]   got some great tragedies in this respect. Nothing is more terrible than for a man or
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:56.940]   a church to lose this sensitiveness to the glory of God. It isn't something sudden. It's
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:03.460]   something that happens gradually, and it happens unconsciously. You can imagine that everything's
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:09.580]   going well, but in a subtle way, the declension comes in. Perhaps the most tragic instance
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:15.660]   of all of this in the whole of the Bible was that man, Samson. You remember the story of
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:21.740]   Samson in the book of Judges. He was born in a special manner, and he had this enormous
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:26.900]   strength and power that differentiated him from everybody else. And he was the great
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:32.240]   warrior for the children of Israel against the Philistines. And you remember how many
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:38.060]   times they tried to discover his secret. They made use of women to entice him and to entangle
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:42.900]   him, and they tried to get out of him the secret of his strength. And he played with
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:49.140]   them. He said on one occasion, he said, "If you bind my hair with very strong ropes,"
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:53.860]   he said, "or bind me as well, I shall be able to move." And they did this, and then they
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:58.380]   called on the Philistines to come. And the Philistines came thinking they'd captured
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:04.580]   Samson, but he got up and he just smashed the cords, tore them asunder with his great
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:09.540]   might and power. Another time he told them that if they nailed the locks of his hair
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:13.900]   to the floor, that that would render him weak and the Philistines would be able to capture
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.540]   him. And they did this, and again they called the Philistines, and they came imagining they'd
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:23.580]   got him. He just shook his head, lifted up the pin on the floor, he could carry gates.
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:28.780]   There was nothing the men couldn't do. But you remember that he fell in love with a woman
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:36.900]   called Delilah. Great men as he was, he had this weakness so evident in public life today.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:42.540]   And here you see she gradually played on him. The idea, you know, that sex doesn't matter,
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.580]   that a man can be loyal in one respect and in no danger of revealing secrets, is not
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:53.380]   only psychological nonsense, it's entirely exposed in the Bible in many of its great
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:58.220]   stories. Here it is in the case of Samson and Delilah. She pestered him and bothered
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:04.940]   him, and at last he told her the truth, that his strength lay in his unshaved locks, and
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:11.100]   that if only they shaved his head that he'd be as weak as other men. And then he fell
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:19.580]   asleep, and while he was asleep they shaved his head, and then having done so, Delilah
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:27.340]   called the Philistines, and she said to Samson, "The Philistines be upon thee, Samson." And
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:34.060]   he awoke out of his sleep and said, "I will go out as at other times before and shake
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:45.540]   myself." And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him. Poor Samson. What a perfect
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:50.780]   picture of the church. "I will go out and I'll do things as I've done them in the past."
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:57.020]   And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him. This is something very subtle. Amen?
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:02.500]   When he loses his sensitivity to the presence of God and his glory, he's losing his power,
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:07.140]   he's losing everything. And it can happen in a very subtle way. And that is why I say
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:12.340]   the most important thing for us is this. Are we sensitive to the presence of God and the
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:18.860]   glory of his power? Do we know when God is present and when he isn't? You remember poor
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:24.340]   William Cooper, Cowper, whichever way you like to pronounce it, in that hymn of his,
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:32.700]   "Where is the blessedness I knew when first I sought the Lord? Where is that soul-refreshing
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:43.380]   view of Jesus and his word? What blissful hours I once enjoyed." But they'd gone. Are
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:49.820]   we able to draw this distinction? Do you know the presence of God and do you know when he's
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:55.940]   not there? My dear friends, this is absolutely vital. You may have knowledge, you may have
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.540]   learning, you may have a thousand and one things, but if you don't know the presence
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:04.240]   of God, you've missed the most important thing, the vital thing. I remember reading a few
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:10.860]   years back in a biography recently republished as a paperback of a man called Robert Bruce
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:16.460]   in Scotland. He was one of the great second generation of preachers in Scotland after
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:24.740]   the Reformation. And the story was of Robert Bruce being visited one morning by two ministers
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:30.020]   who wanted to consult him about some very urgent matter. And he kept them waiting for
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:37.140]   two hours. Why? Well, this was the explanation he gave. The previous night, he'd had a wonderful
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:44.860]   experience of the presence of God. He realized the presence of his Lord. His room was filled
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:51.380]   with the glory and he'd been lifted up to heaven and he'd been rejoicing in this communion.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:56.500]   But when he woke up this next morning, he was not conscious of this. And he felt he
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:01.380]   couldn't see these men, though they were two important men, and he couldn't have any consultation
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:10.260]   with them until the communion with God had been first restored. Christian people, how
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:17.220]   much do we know about the presence of the glory of God? You can have a successful church,
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:21.580]   successful financially, successful in numbers. You can have campaigns and people say, "Isn't
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:25.820]   it marvelous? Everything's going well." But the question is, "Is the presence of
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:32.220]   the glory of God among us?" This is the vital question. And are we sensitive to this?
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:39.100]   Well, someone may say to me, "How does one know the presence of God? How do you know
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:46.980]   and realize the presence of the glory of God?" Now, to me, this is the all-important question
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:53.020]   for the Christian church today. This comes before everything else. And though you have
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:58.420]   everything else, it's of no value unless you have this, the glory of God, the presence
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:03.220]   of God. How do you know this? I think this question needs to be asked very urgently at
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:09.100]   the present time, because one is hearing strange things. We are told by some that all we've
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.860]   got to do is to go to them and tell them, "Jesus loves you," and to start making
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:18.460]   them laugh. Is that it? Some people seem to think that the way that you sense this is
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:23.820]   that you begin to dance and so on. Is that it? Well, you see, what we find in the record
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:30.060]   is something very different. Go back again to that last chapter of the book of Exodus.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:38.660]   Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:45.100]   And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:50.940]   thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. Now, on previous days, Moses
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.060]   had been going in and out of this tabernacle. He'd been supervising the work, and there
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.020]   was no trouble. He could go in, he could go out, there was no difficulty. But now the
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:04.180]   glory has descended, and Moses goes to go in, and he can't go in. He's terrified.
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:13.180]   He's arrested. The glory of God. The first effect of a realization of the glory of God
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:24.740]   is always to fill people with a sense of fear, and of awe, and of alarm, indeed of terror.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:31.620]   You remember the story of Jacob? It's an old story there in the Old Testament, but
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:37.500]   it's a very vital and a very important story. Jacob, you remember, was running away from
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:42.500]   his brother, and the wrath of his brother. And he'd been walking and running throughout
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:48.780]   the day, and at last he's tired out, and he feels he must have some rest. So he lies on
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:52.340]   the ground. There wasn't a pillar there, so he borrowed that stone that was at hand,
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:57.820]   and he put his head on it, and he fell asleep, and he began, you remember, to dream. And
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:03.060]   then I read, "And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and said," he'd seen the vision, you
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:07.580]   remember, of the ladder from earth to heaven, and the angels ascending and descending upon
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:14.100]   it. "Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, 'Surely the Lord is in this place.'
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:22.620]   And I knew it not," listen, "and he was afraid, and said, 'How dreadful is this place! This
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:32.740]   is none other but the house of God. This, and this, is the gate of heaven. My dear friend,
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:38.660]   any man who comes anywhere near to God and His glory is humbled. He's filled with amazement
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:45.340]   and alarm, with awe, and with a kind of terror. The presence of the everlasting and eternal
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:52.100]   God! This is invariably the effect and the result." Do you remember the account of the
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:59.820]   call of that young man Isaiah to his ministry? And he was an excellent young man. In the
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.140]   sixth chapter about the call of Isaiah, in the book of the prophet Isaiah, "In the year
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:10.540]   that King Isaiah died, I also saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up,
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:16.100]   and His train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphims and so on. What effect
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:25.500]   did this have upon him?" Listen, "Then said I, 'Woe is me, for I am undone, because I
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:32.380]   am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. For mine
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:41.980]   eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.'" It's invariable. You can't come anywhere
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:47.420]   near to God and His glory without a sense of awe. Do you remember John in the book of
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:52.620]   Revelation? He has a vision of this glory. Do you remember what happened? "I fell down
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:58.540]   as one dead." And yet people today seem to think that the height of spirituality is a
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:05.500]   slippiness, a lightness, a frivolity, a superficial effervescence, an emotionalism. My dear friends,
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:13.940]   read the scriptures. Any man who comes near to God is humbled, he's abased, he's alarmed.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:19.740]   And as you read the story of the church, you'll find the same thing, the story of revivals.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:24.220]   What always happened in the great revivals, it's always the same thing. The first effect
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:30.140]   of a revival is that people are humbled. They're alarmed. They're terrified. They doubt whether
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:35.460]   they've ever been Christians at all. And then they go through an agony and then come out
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:43.880]   into their great joy. Read again for yourselves in the journal of John Wesley. He and George
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:49.980]   Whitfield and his brother Charles and many others were at a watch night service. I think
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:57.260]   it was in Fetter Lane in London, December the 31st, 1738. And he goes on to describe
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:01.900]   this meeting, how they were met together to pray and to sing hymns together. And he goes
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:08.940]   on and says that after many hours, suddenly God came down upon them. And he said many
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:16.560]   fell to the floor. Many were in an agony of repentance. Many were singing the praises
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:22.620]   of God. And then suddenly he said they all joined together in singing, "We praise, we
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:34.260]   worship thee, O God, thy sovereign power. We sound abroad." Humbled, abased. I remember
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:42.900]   reading an account of a revival breaking out in a theological seminary in America in 1757.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:48.100]   You know, in those days, they had revivals even in theological colleges. And there was
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:55.140]   one in this college, which ultimately became the Princeton Theological College and later
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:41:03.580]   the Westminster Theological Seminary. A revival broke out there in 1757. And one of the Tennant
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:08.380]   brothers visited the place to see what was happening. And he wrote to a friend and he
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:14.220]   said, "I've never been in such a place in my life. It was a veritable boching," he said.
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:19.740]   The stoutest men were humbled. They were all weeping. Now these were theological students.
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:24.520]   They were godly, religious young men. And they'd felt a call to the ministry. And yet
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:30.260]   you see, when God came amongst them, when the glory descended, they were all not only
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:36.200]   humbled, they were convicted. They were weeping, pleading with God to pardon them, acutely
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:42.580]   conscious of their unworthiness and their foulness and their emptiness, weeping a veritable
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:50.260]   boching. Now this is invariable. And I'm asked to believe today that the Holy Spirit has
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:55.500]   suddenly changed himself and his methods, and that you can go immediately to some great
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:42:02.700]   ecstatic joy. It's impossible, my friends. The first effect always of the realization
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:10.420]   of the glory of God is to humble, to fill us with fear and a sense of awe, with a desire
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:18.760]   to feel that we are unclean and unworthy, not a riot of ecstasy and emotion, but a humbling
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:25.140]   and a consciousness of a great and a terrible need. Have we ever been humbled under the
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:31.940]   almighty hand of God? Do you know what it is to undergo deep conviction of sin? Have
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:38.020]   you mourned over your sinfulness? It has been invariable in all the great revivals, as it
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:43.900]   is always invariable in the Bible itself. "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" they cried
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:49.860]   on the day of Pentecost. They didn't start singing and laughing. No, no. Always a humbling
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:56.380]   and a conviction, a sense of awe, a sense of the glory and the terror of this everlasting
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:02.560]   and eternal and holy God. Very well. These are the signs. So let me conclude by putting
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:11.600]   it like this. Why have we talked so little about this? Why have we talked so much about
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:17.340]   a social gospel and a political gospel? That's what I'm told today, that there's no hope
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:23.940]   for the church until she enters into politics, until she leads in a revolution. This has
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:29.700]   been said recently. The church must be the leader in rebellion and revolution. My dear
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:35.940]   friends, when will we come back to the Scriptures? Why have we forgotten all this? And I believe
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.900]   the answer is that many of these good people have never heard about this, and they know
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:44.700]   nothing at all about it. They regard the church as a human institution. They've never been
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:50.660]   interested in the presence of God. They offer prayers to God, but they don't expect a manifestation
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:59.100]   of the glory of God. Isn't that part of the explanation? Another explanation is our fatal
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:05.620]   self-trust and self-confidence. If you think that having a head full of theology is going
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:11.760]   to solve all your problems, you're as foolish as the rest of them. No, no. We must realize
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:17.500]   our utter inadequacy, that though you have your knowledge and your learning and everything
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:23.740]   else, it is useless unless the glory comes down upon it. But another explanation that's
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:29.380]   given in this chapter is to me a very important one and a very vital one. Did you notice the
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:35.580]   history as it was read to us by our friend Mr. Sutton at the beginning? This is the story.
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:40.500]   I'll tell it to you very hurriedly. These children of Israel had been conquered by the
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:45.740]   Philistines, and then a number of them met together one day, and they said, "Look here,
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:49.620]   we shouldn't put up with this." They said, "Let's gather an army together and go up against
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:56.180]   the Philistines." And they did so. And they challenged the Philistines. And when they
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:02.300]   joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines, and they slew of the army in
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:08.020]   the field about 4,000 men. Then a very interesting thing happened. When the people were coming
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:12.860]   to the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us today before the
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:19.060]   Philistines?" In other words, when they went home, they said, "Well, now, why were we defeated?"
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:24.020]   They had a kind of post-mortem, if you like, on the military defeat. And then somebody
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:29.300]   obviously got up and said, "I can tell you exactly what happened." He said, "We made one
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:34.540]   fatal mistake." And it was this. He said, "You know, we were in such a hurry, we were
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:40.380]   so excited that we went up and challenged the Philistines without taking the Ark of
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:45.820]   the Lord with us." You see, the Ark was no longer in the camp. It was in another place.
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:50.500]   He said, "I make a proposal. Let us fetch the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:55.940]   Shiloh unto us, that when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:46:01.020]   enemies." And they all agreed. So the people sent to Shiloh that they might bring from
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:06.140]   thence the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. They said, "This is marvelous." "That's the
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:11.620]   explanation," they said. "We went up without the Ark. If only we take the Ark with us and
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:16.340]   gather another army, then we'll get a great victory." You see, their idea of the Ark was
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:20.820]   that it was a sort of mascot. When you didn't take the mascot with you, you were defeated.
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:25.300]   If you had the mascot with you, you had a great and a resounding success. They regarded
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:30.180]   the Ark as something they could take up and put down and use it to their own convenience
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:35.940]   and so have great success. And they proceeded to do this. They sent for the Ark and they
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:42.860]   gathered their army and then they proceeded up. And Israel shouted with a great shout
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:48.540]   so that the earth rang again. And we are told that when the Philistines heard the noise
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:52.620]   of the shout, they said, "What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.740]   Hebrews?" And they understood that the Ark of the Lord was coming to the camp. And the
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:01.460]   Philistines were afraid for they said, "God is coming to the camp." God was identified
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:05.920]   with the Ark, you see. Not surprising that Philistines do this. But it's very wrong when
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:10.420]   the people of God do this. And they said, "Woe unto us, for there hath not been such
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:16.020]   a thing heretofore. Woe unto us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:21.760]   gods? These are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness. Be
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:27.660]   strong and quit yourselves like men, we Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews.
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:35.380]   Quit yourselves like men and fight." And they did fight. But you remember what happened?
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:43.100]   Israel was not only defeated this time, she was absolutely routed. Her army was decimated.
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:48.540]   The Philistines captured the Ark. Hophni and Phinehas were killed, and the old man Eli
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:56.360]   died. Awful disaster, though they've got the Ark in the midst. You see the lesson? If you
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:03.460]   use the Ark of God to suit your own convenience and regard it as a mascot, if you think you
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:08.360]   can take up God and put him down when you want to, you will have the most terrible defeat
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:13.280]   you've ever known. And yet that's what many of us have often done, isn't it? We forget
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:17.900]   all about God, then we're taken ill, and the doctors don't seem to be succeeding, and we
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:22.760]   pray to God, and we're surprised he doesn't answer us. Or we pray about some loved one
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:27.940]   and dear one, and we're amazed that God doesn't answer us. My friends, we've been insulting
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:34.940]   him. We think we can use God when we want, as these foolish children of Israel were using
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:44.440]   the very Ark that represented God as a mascot to suit their own schemes and plans and devices.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:51.280]   This is why the glory of God departs, my friend. Unless we are filled with a sense of reverence
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:57.180]   and of awe, unless we submit utterly to God, though we have the Ark, as it were, in the
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:03.860]   midst, it will avail us nothing, and our defeat will be greater than ever. To pay lip service
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:10.840]   to God is not prayer. We must realize the presence of the glory of the Lord.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:16.180]   Very well, then, what are we to do? And it seems to me the answer is quite plain, and
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:24.160]   it is quite simple. We must go back to the beginning and do as Moses did. Here is God's
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:29.420]   command to Moses, "Do this, do this, do this. We've got to do it." What is the church to
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:36.500]   do today? Is she to lead revolutions and rebellions? Is she to go more and more into politics?
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:41.340]   Is she to provide entertainment for the people? Of course she isn't. What is God's command
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:48.980]   to his people? It is to return to his word. This is the first command, nothing else. We
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:57.180]   must return to the plans and the specifications. This is the way to do God's work, and there
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:03.500]   is no other. The church has tried everything else. It leads to disaster. Let's come back
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:10.380]   to the word of God. Let's learn it. Let's know it. Let's preach it. Let's give it obedience.
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:20.180]   But even that isn't enough. On top of that, we must pray to God to return among us. I
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:26.780]   say again, even orthodoxy is not enough. You can have a dead orthodoxy. There are dead
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:33.580]   orthodox churches today. There are dead orthodox individuals. We must be orthodox. But on top
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:40.780]   of the orthodoxy, the glory of the Lord must descend. So having come back to the truth,
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:47.740]   we must pray without ceasing. We must plead with God, the God of our fathers, to come
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:54.660]   back amongst us. Why here we are in this district, a district that has known so much of this.
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:59.340]   We need a touch, you know, of what used to happen on Mo Cop. They used to call it the
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:06.580]   spirit of burning. Hugh Bourne, William Close, these men that God raised up, though they
[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:11.140]   were simple and ignorant and unlearned men, they were men who submitted themselves to
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:17.340]   God and who realized that without the power of the Spirit, they could do nothing. Are
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:24.700]   you praying for revival? Are you concerned about the visible spiritual manifestation
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:33.180]   of the glory of God? Are you unhappy? Are you ready to pray with William Cowper, "Return,
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:43.060]   O holy dove, return, sweet messenger of rest. I hate the sin that made thee mourn and drove
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:51.180]   thee from my breast." I used to hear the old preachers saying that what worried them was
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:56.820]   when the "O" went out of the prayers of the people. They didn't stop praying, but the
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:08.460]   "O" went out. "Return, O holy dove, return." This longing, this yearning for the realization
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:15.300]   of the glory of God and his presence and his power. Well, here it seems to me is the plain
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:25.020]   lesson of this old incident. God doesn't change. God's people don't change. God's way of dealing
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:31.420]   with his people do not change. Throughout the biblical history, throughout subsequent
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:38.140]   history, you will find that God works on the same pattern. He does it in nature. Spring,
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:44.300]   summer, autumn, winter. God repeats himself, and he does it in a spiritual sense. And this
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:49.940]   idea that God the Spirit has suddenly forsaken all he's ever done, and that in some very
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:54.940]   simple easy way now, you can go to the very topmost level of Christianity, is a denial
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:53:02.900]   of the teaching of the whole scripture. No, no. We need to realize the presence of God
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:13.980]   himself, the glory of God, and the glory of God is something that is so mighty that it
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:23.900]   fills us with awe, with fear, with a sense of utter unworthiness. Christian people, do
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:29.220]   you know what it is to be humbled under the mighty hand of God? Do we know anything about
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:35.260]   the fear of the Lord? It's the great message of the Bible. There are no shortcuts in the
[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:42.340]   spiritual realm. There are no easy ways to blessing. There is always the work that the
[00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:52.540]   Moses has to do, and then you wait upon him and plead with him to descend upon you in
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:54:04.100]   the glorious power of his eternal might. May God give us all grace to learn this old lesson.
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:09.580]   And whatever else we may remember or forget, let us ever have this in the center of our
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:21.100]   thinking that without the glory of the Lord, we are helpless. We can do nothing. We are
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:31.620]   even weaker than other people, but with God, we can be mighty and triumphant. And though
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:38.700]   we are confronted today by the Philistines of this 20th century, when the glory of the
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:47.020]   Lord is amongst us again, we shall scatter our enemies and experience days of revival
[00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:56.380]   and of rejoicing. Let us pray. O Lord, our God, forgive us that we are so much like thine
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:07.660]   ancient people, so foolish, so forgetful, so unconcerned about thy presence, so insensitive
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:18.580]   to that presence. O God, have mercy upon us. Pardon our backslidings. Pardon our pride.
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:26.100]   Pardon our confidence in ourselves and our own endeavors. O God, make of us again men
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:34.540]   and women who shall be as little children. Let nothing please nor pain me apart, O Lord,
[00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:44.620]   from thee, God of our fathers. Be our God. Let it be known this day that thou art God
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:51.460]   in Israel. We know that thou hast not changed, thou canst not change. Thou art the Father
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:59.020]   of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. God of Abraham, Isaac,
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:08.780]   and of Jacob. God of the great prophets. God of the apostles. God of the martyrs. God of
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:17.540]   the Protestant fathers. God of the Puritans, the Methodists. God of our fathers. Be our
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:26.700]   God. Make bare thine almighty arm. Humble us all beneath it, and then lift us up and
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:34.020]   use us to thy glory and to thy praise. And unto thee, and unto thee alone, shall we give
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:42.900]   all the praise and the honor and the glory, both now and forever. Amen.
