[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   Welcome back to the podcast, episode number 1700, as we approach the end of our ninth
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.080]   year.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.760]   It's amazing.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.360]   We talk a lot about joy in God on this podcast, and when John Piper says, "God is most glorified
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:27.440]   in us when we are most satisfied in him," he put the motto in the plural, "us," "we."
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.880]   And this is intentional.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.800]   Christian hedonism is not a me-and-God spiritual nirvana.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.280]   To be sure, we experience amazing things alone with God.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.000]   But divine joy is always meant to expand, and to expand by being shared.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.560]   Back in the fall of 2019, Pastor John traveled to Holland to share his life, his passions,
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.680]   and what drives him theologically.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.880]   And the result was a fascinating testimonial, part of which I want to share with you today.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.440]   Here's Pastor John in Holland in 2019 explaining how we can increase our joy in God and why
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.720]   we need each other to do it.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:13.160]   God is most glorified, most praised in you when you are most satisfied in him.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.200]   So praising is the consummation of joy.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.400]   It's the completion of joy.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.240]   But joy is the essence of praising.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.680]   The way I like to say it in English because it sounds so good is, "Prizing, prizing is
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.520]   the essence of praising."
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.360]   You prize something, you value it, you are satisfied with it, and that is the heart and
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.120]   the essence of praising.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.680]   Otherwise, praising is hypocritical.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.600]   Most people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.000]   They don't prize me, they're just singing songs on Sunday morning because that's what
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.240]   you're supposed to do.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.480]   So that was another huge part, and Jonathan Edwards is the one who gave me the key to
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:14.400]   that, because he said, "God glorifies himself not only by communicating himself to our minds,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:25.800]   but by communicating himself to our hearts and being glorified by our rejoicing in him."
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.920]   And I thought, "I've never heard anybody say that."
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.760]   So all this has happened.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.800]   In these three years, these thoughts, these discoveries were happening, and they've — I've
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.240]   just never been the same since those three years.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.240]   So let me end, re-end with just one more illustration.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.040]   So the, the last argument this morning was that God is most glorified in you when you're
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.200]   most satisfied in Him.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.920]   So the glory of God depends upon your pursuing pleasure in God.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.000]   It's the essence of it.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   The argument just before that was love.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.640]   You can't love people if you don't pursue your joy in God, because loving people is
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.960]   the overflow of joy in God that meets the needs of others.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.160]   So let me end like this.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.640]   That, that was the last piece that I couldn't figure out.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.280]   I saw that God is glorified when I'm satisfied in Him.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.560]   Like my wife receiving "I want to be with you, Noelle," that honors her.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.720]   "I want to be with you, God.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.360]   You make me glad more than anybody."
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.920]   God is honored when I say that and feel that.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:50.520]   I could not for the life of me figure out how that vertical satisfaction made me a loving
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.060]   person horizontally.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.840]   I knew that there were other religions that had pictures of people sitting with their
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.440]   arms folded and their legs crossed under a tree experiencing a kind of karma and just
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.440]   let the world go to hell.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.440]   Who cares?
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.440]   I'm happy.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.120]   I'm happy in God.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.680]   I don't care if people are dying or suffering.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.520]   I knew that couldn't be.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.120]   That's not the Bible.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.200]   That cannot be.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.000]   But what's, what's the link?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:33.840]   And Paul was talking to the elders in Acts 20, to the elders of Ephesus.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:44.880]   And at the end of his talk, he said, "Remember," this is Acts 20 verse 35, there it is, "Remember."
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.240]   He didn't say forget.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.160]   Some people say, "You shouldn't have this motive to be blessed."
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.080]   And I'll say, "If that were true, he'd say forget."
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:04.080]   "Remember, it is more blessed to give than to receive."
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.360]   More blessed?
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.360]   More happy?
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.520]   More satisfied?
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.880]   More content?
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.760]   More joyful?
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.280]   To give my life away?
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.480]   Die for others?
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.280]   Suffer for others?
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280]   Sacrifice for others?
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.280]   Yes.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.040]   You want more joy?
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.000]   Die for others.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Live for others.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.520]   That's what it says.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.000]   It is more blessed, more happy, more content if you will give yourself away.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.280]   Don't just fold your arms and sit under a tree and say, "Me and you, God, we're happy.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.400]   I don't care about other people."
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.880]   You won't be happy, not long.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.800]   That's not joy in God.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:05.200]   So I discovered that joy in God is a peculiar kind of thing.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:15.600]   It not only honors God, but it also is a kind of pressure inside of me.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.960]   It wants to be out.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:26.560]   It wants to draw you in because I — the way it works is that joy in God gets bigger
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:38.080]   if I can include you in it so that your joy in God becomes part of my joy in God.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.960]   So that's why I came to Hollywood.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.120]   I wanted to be happier.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.320]   And it would make me very happy.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.600]   I mean it is making me happy.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.480]   I'm very happy right now just to talk to you about these things.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:05.960]   But if I, if I heard that God took these few words and drew you in to more joy in God that
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.920]   caused you to lay down your life for the people in your country who don't know Him.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:22.200]   If I heard that a half a dozen of you out of the 5,000 that have been here, my joy would
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.200]   be greater.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.880]   That's what John said, right?
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.080]   My joy is complete when my children walk in the truth.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.640]   And you're not my children, but kind of.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.400]   I mean some of you are older than I am, but not many.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:47.240]   So I don't know if I'll ever see you again on earth, but if God, God preserves me, if
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:57.720]   He holds me fast and He works in you to bring you into a deeper, sweeter enjoyment of Himself
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:06.320]   for the sake of the world and His glory, I will not have come to Holland in vain.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.760]   That was John Piper sharing his testimony, the story of his theological awakening back
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.320]   on November 17th, 2019 at a conference in Holland.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.680]   And this entire session is available at the site right now under its title, "How God
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.560]   Made Me Happy in Him, John Piper's Journey into Joy."
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.320]   Entire thing is worth a listen or a watch.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.960]   I'm pretty sure we have video of this one.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.440]   Thanks for listening to today's clip.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.680]   Most clips are crowdsourced except for the last three.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.600]   I pulled those together myself, but when you find a clip, email it to me.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.080]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens in
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.000]   the audio, and tell me how it impacted your life.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.880]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.080]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.720]   Well speaking of core questions of Christian hedonism, next up is a question from Brazil.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.980]   Does God command our praise for His sake or for our own sake?
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.440]   That is a great question.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.440]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.160]   We are joined in studio with Pastor John.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160]   We'll be with you on Friday for that.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.680]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.680]   [END]
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.680]   1. What is the Holy Spirit's plan for the world?
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.680]   2. What is the Holy Spirit's plan for the world?
