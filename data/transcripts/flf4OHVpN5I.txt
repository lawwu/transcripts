[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400]   2020, the year of the Great Lockdown, leading to what some are now calling the Great Coronavirus
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.840]   Recession. It was triggered by a strategic wager, sacrifice economic momentum in order
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.480]   to physically distance people, all with the goal of starving and killing off a spreading
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.960]   virus. It was a huge gamble, and it hurt. The Dow Jones flirting with 30,000 in February
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.480]   plummeted to under 19,000 a month later. As I record this, 22 million Americans have filed
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.480]   unemployment claims. The financial fallout of the Great Coronavirus Recession has been
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.200]   compared to the Great Recession of 2007-2009, even evoking comparisons to the Great Depression
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.040]   of 1929-1933. Looking ahead, some think the economy will bounce back to normal as soon
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.440]   as the virus is under control. Others are less optimistic. Recessions are killjoys.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.760]   They destroy small businesses, they disrupt life, they take away our normalcy, and they
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.920]   cost us our happiness. In March, our president predicted America would lose more lives to
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.320]   the despair of recession than to the virus itself, saying, "People get tremendous anxiety
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.520]   and depression, and you have suicides over things like this when you have terrible economies
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.480]   in far greater numbers than the numbers that we're talking about with regard to the virus."
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.440]   Statistically, this statement is hotly contested, but just appreciate these words and what they
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.240]   say about the apparent threat of economic uncertainty on emotional well-being.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.760]   This isn't the first recession, it won't be the last recession. So what is God up to in
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.560]   our recession? About a decade ago, John Piper preached a sermon under that exact title,
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.680]   "What is the Recession For?" It was preached on February 1st, 2009, in the middle of the
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.840]   Great Recession, at the time the Dow had been dropping but had not yet bottomed out. Recessions,
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.000]   he shows, are not meant to kill our joy, but to make our joy more stable. Here's Pastor
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.720]   John explaining from 2 Corinthians 8, verses 1-2.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.680]   He intends to relocate the roots of our joy in his grace, not our goods, in his mercy,
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:32.560]   not our money, in his worth, not our wealth. God sends recessions to yank up the roots
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:44.660]   of our joy from the pleasures of the world and plant them in the glory of his grace.
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:52.120]   Now there's one text in the New Testament that is the clearest recession text in the
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.760]   Bible, and I'm going to take you there now. It's 2 Corinthians 8. We want you to know,
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.160]   there's about the grace of God that was given among the churches of Macedonia. So he's writing
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.880]   to Corinth about something that happened up in Macedonia, up around Philippi. "For in
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:20.240]   a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:28.840]   in a wealth of generosity on their part." Now that's my dream for Bethlehem. I don't
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.000]   think we'll ever reach the poverty part, but it wouldn't hurt, perhaps. Verse 2 says, "These
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.040]   folks have a wealth of generosity." That's what I want for us. I mean every kind of generosity.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.520]   I mean, after this service, somebody wants to talk to you, you're generous with your
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:56.040]   time. Somebody needs some money, you're generous with your money. Every kind. In other words,
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.480]   we're just the kind of people who are there. We're just ready to be spent for others. That's
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.520]   what I mean by generous. I want that for our people. So my question here is, where did
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.920]   that come from? Where did that come from in this text? And it's so clear. Sometimes I'm
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:23.360]   embarrassed to preach on this text to insult your intelligence. Prepare to be insulted.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.860]   Did it come, you can help me, you can just tell me what the answers are to these questions.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.340]   Did it come from their prosperity? What's the answer? No, because they don't have any.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.240]   It says, verse 2, "Their extreme poverty overflowed in a wealth of liberality." So scratch that
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:52.480]   answer. It didn't come from prosperity. Do you know what state in the United States is
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:00.200]   per capita the poorest? Tell me, risk it. It'll be an insult, but say it anyway. Mississippi.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.060]   Do you know what state per capita has the highest level of charitable giving? Now you
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.320]   know the answer. It's Mississippi. There's a correlation, folks, between poverty and
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.360]   giving, not wealth and giving. Wealthy people don't give much money proportionately. They
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.800]   give a lot of money, it just looks like they're giving a lot of money. But when somebody has
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.080]   almost nothing, and they get a plea, and they can't resist the giving, something's going
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.200]   on there really beautiful. And that's what's going on here. These people are poor, in verse
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.440]   2, and they've got a wealth of generosity. Second question. Where did it come from? Did
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:52.840]   it come from being surrounded by approving people and culture? The answer to that one
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.680]   is no, because they're being harassed. It says in verse 2, look at it, "In a severe
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.440]   test of affliction." So now you've got poverty, and you've got people beating up on them.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.800]   The reason I'm assuming affliction means that is because of Acts 17, verse 5. That's what
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:19.320]   happened in Thessalonica. That is up there around the Macedonians. Jason got arrested
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:28.840]   and beat up. The church, three weeks old, is being hurt. And they're given like crazy.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:37.320]   I mean, this is recession over the top, and they're lavishly given. So, question third
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:46.440]   time, where'd this come from? It says in verse 2 where it came from. Their abundance of joy
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:57.000]   in that extreme poverty overflowed with a wealth of generosity. So, they were happy.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.280]   The recession was abounding, they were poor, people were beating up on them, and they were
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:11.520]   so happy, they gave. Last question, where'd that joy come from? Verse 1, "We want you
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.680]   to know, brothers, about the..." Say those next three words. "That's the answer about
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.560]   the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia." And what does
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.880]   grace of God look like? It looks like abundant joy in the midst of poverty, overflowing in
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.960]   a wealth of liberality. That's what grace looks like when it comes down. The question
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.040]   for the church is, this church, your church, wherever you go to church, the question for
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:45.320]   the church is, "Have you experienced grace? Do you know your sediment of self-reliance
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:51.200]   so well, and you see it so clearly when it gets all murky after you get bumped by your
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.120]   wife or bumped by your kid or bumped by your broker, and you're looking at your glass,
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:03.600]   it's all murky, and you hate it, and you're stunned at the grace of God that He loves
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.040]   you, that He forgives you, that He stays by you, that He keeps holding on to you, that
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.960]   He brings you home to glory, and you can hardly imagine a God so kind that you're going to
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.280]   give and give and give to people who are in need.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.960]   I just want to be like that. I want you to be like that because it's such a beautiful,
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.760]   beautiful thing. So the way recessions work is that they bump us, and then they reveal
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:34.160]   the sin, and then they jerk up, and they jerk up the roots of our joy, which were down there
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.840]   in our money, and in our security, and how everything was going, and we suddenly are
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:46.600]   rootless for a minute, and then He mercifully sinks them into the glory of the grace of
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:53.760]   God. And they're firm, and they're solid, and they're not shaken anymore. Be thankful
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:01.680]   in all circumstances. This is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Amen.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.680]   Amen. This was taken from John Piper's sermon titled "What is the Recession for? Some of
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.600]   God's Purposes." He preached it on February 1st, 2009, and the full message is available
