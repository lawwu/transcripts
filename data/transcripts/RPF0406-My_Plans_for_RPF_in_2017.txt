[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.500]   It's 2017, and this year is going to be fantastic.
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500]   Let's get it started.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:42.000]   [Music]
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.500]   with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.000]   to live a rich and meaningful life now, in 2017.
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.000]   While also building and working on your plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and I'm your host. Thank you for being with me.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.500]   Man, it's good to be back.
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.500]   It's been a difficult start to the year already, and it's only January 3.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.000]   More on that coming up.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   [Music]
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.500]   Nothing like getting off to a difficult start on January 3.
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.000]   You know, with the holidays this year, January 1, Sunday, and then January 2
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.500]   off for most people, and I had some things I needed to attend to,
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.000]   so I went ahead and took it off as well.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I considered canceling January 2 and going ahead and starting the show early,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.500]   but I needed to finish up some things before getting started.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.000]   Well, then this morning on January 3, I woke up, and I had planned to wake up
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   very early and get to work early, and just like I had planned,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I had some kind of bad stomach bug.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.500]   And so that dogged my heels all day long, and here it is at 8.30 at night.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   [Laughs]
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   On Tuesday, January 3, that I'm finally getting to the recording of the show.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.500]   It's just been a tough day.
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.000]   But, hey, that's life.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Tough day, but I'm getting you the show out, because that is one of the big things
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   that is a major focus for me, which is largely going to be
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   what I'm going to share with you today.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Just a very personal show.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.500]   Littled up my plans for 2017, a few changes that I just want to share with you.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.500]   I try when I make changes on the show to let you know about them,
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.500]   so those of you who are long-time and regular listeners, you'll know about them.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   If you're not a long-time listener, feel free to skip this one and come back tomorrow
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.500]   for more focused, personal content about you.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.000]   But today is just a little bit about me, some of the lessons that I'm learning,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.500]   and some of the lessons that I've learned in the year that's just behind us, 2016.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.500]   So today's show will be pretty brief and to the point.
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   I've got to get to bed.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.000]   I've got to get up before a.m. for a flight to Chicago tomorrow.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.500]   I've got a quick two-day trip up to Chicago tomorrow.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.500]   So, yeah, so let's go.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.000]   2017 is going to be a really great year.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I'm very excited about it for me.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And I also hope that it will be a great year for you.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.500]   And I hope that I can contribute to that through the content here on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.000]   In many ways, 2016 was a difficult year for me.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   It was a year of disappointment in many ways,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.500]   and I'm going to share some of those disappointments with you,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   again, with the hope of encouraging you.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I don't like it when people only share the good,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.500]   the positive, the exciting, the enthusiastic,
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.500]   and don't share the difficult.
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.000]   I don't like it when people present an image of themselves that only includes the positive.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.500]   I don't like it when people are fake.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.000]   So, in light of that, I'm going to share with you
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.500]   some of the reasons why this past year has been difficult for me.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.000]   Because I don't think it's fair if you only get one side of the story.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   For example, I know that many of you have followed the journey that I've been on
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   with entrepreneurialism and Radical Personal Finance here,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   and kind of this lifestyle business that I've sought to create,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.500]   and you've been building similar ones of yourselves.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.000]   And it's very easy for someone like me to only talk about how great that is
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   and how fantastic it is.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   But here's the reality.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   It's a new year, and I'm sitting here at 8.37 p.m. on Monday night, recording a show,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   and I've got to get up at 4 a.m. tomorrow to catch an airplane flight
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   for a busy, busy few days.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.500]   That's the reality of business.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.000]   So, in order to be fair, I want to share with you
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   kind of what's happened and what's happening,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   so that as we walk through 2017 together,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   that you can get the full picture.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I hope you had a great holiday season, my family.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   We had a great time.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Just returned back into town from a two-week road trip.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   The last couple of weeks.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Back this past year in 2016, I bought a small RV,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   which was a long-time thing that I had wanted to buy,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   and went ahead and did it this past year.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And so, we had a great time.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I spent two weeks, took off about December, what was it, 15th?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Meandered up out of Florida, and cruised up to--
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   We cruised up the East Coast of the United States.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   We did-- We're calling it-- In our family, we called it
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   the Great Lighthouse Tour of 2016.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   My son, my three-year-old son, is very, very into lighthouses.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   He just loves lighthouses.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   We live near the Jupiter Lighthouse here in Jupiter, Florida,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   and we often go down to the beach and swim and paddleboard
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   underneath the Jupiter Lighthouse.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   And so, he loves that lighthouse, and so we toured him
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and took him all around, showed him the St. Augustine Lighthouse.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   We wound up going up the Tybee Island Lighthouse in Georgia,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   and we saw a couple of others as well,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   which we really enjoyed that.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   So, we had a great time and just took off work.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I was behind, and I thought I was getting things done,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   and then life was just busy, but we had a great time,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   and I hope you had a great time as well.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   But one of the key things that I've done a lot
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   over the last couple of months with 2016
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   was really reflected on what worked and what didn't work for me.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And probably the key insight that's the most important for me
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   was to recognize that 2016 was a year of unfocused wandering.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And this is not something that you want to emulate.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Now, it's probably better, my wandering is probably better
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   than some wandering I've had in the past.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I certainly have had clear goals of what I wanted to do,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   but I haven't known how to get there.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   It's been one of the biggest challenges for me in my business
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   and in my personal life, just trying to figure out
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   how do I actually get from here to there.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   In short, the lack of a business plan for me,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   especially with radical personal finance,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   caught up to me this past year.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Long-time listeners will remember that, as I've told the story,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   when I started this show, I did not have a business plan.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Now, that's not a good plan starting a business.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Generally, you want to have a business plan.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Business planning is very important,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   and it's very important to be able to sit down
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   with a business, with a spreadsheet,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   and if you're starting a new business,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   figure out what you're going to sell,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   where you think your customers are going to come from,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   how you're going to do that.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   That's very, very important.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   But I could not figure out any possible way for me to do that
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   with starting this podcast.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   The reason was, the metaphor that I've used is,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   I felt like trying to figure out how to build a business
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   that's based off of a podcast is kind of like figuring out
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   how to become a multimillionaire
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   by transforming yourself into a best-selling author.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   It's possible that you could become a multimillionaire
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   by becoming a best-selling author.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   But the path to get there is not clear.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It's not simple.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's not easy.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And so, if you're going to become an author,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   all you can really do is just sit down and start writing.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Now, you can study along the way
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   what type of things you want to write about.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   You can practice your writing style.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   You can figure out who you're going to try to sell to,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   and you can start to create a plan.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   But to crack that nut on best-selling
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   is really hard to design,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   especially if you don't have any previous experience
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   as an author.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Now, perhaps there are authors who can do it,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   but usually they're going to need to bring
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   some significant experience
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   or some deep, deep background in marketing
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   or some really solid plan to the table.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   It's just not an easy thing to do.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Well, when I started Radical Personal Finance,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   it was a similar thing for me,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   where I said, "Well, if I can build a show
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   that people find useful and valuable
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   and want to listen to,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   and if I can build an audience,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   then I know, because I've done my homework,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   I know there are a bunch of different ways
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   that I can make a living from that."
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   But I didn't know how.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   So I set that aside, pretty much,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   and just kind of worked on just learning how to do it,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   publishing lots of shows,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   trying to build an audience,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   figuring things out.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And it was very helpful.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Many of you found me during that time
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   and started to listen.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Well, the challenge was that back at the end of about 2015,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   I started to need to figure out how to transform
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   and earn more from the podcast
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   and earn more from my work.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And so I didn't know exactly how to do that.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Now, if you've ever considered podcasting,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   I want to make something very clear to you.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   From experience and a piece of advice,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   podcasting is a bad, bad business.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I strongly discourage you
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   from trying to get into podcasting as a business.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   The very best way for you to utilize something like a podcast
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   will be as a component to your existing business
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   or as a supplement in the marketing plan
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   to your existing business.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   That's a much wiser approach to use podcasting.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I would strongly discourage you
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   from trying to build podcasting as a business.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   But I've been building podcasting as a business.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   And there's been kind of this constant struggle
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   and a constant tug of war in wanting to do
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   and knowing what I want to do.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Let me give you some practical examples.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   The very best way for me as a financial planner
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   to use a podcast would be as a form of marketing
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   and outreach to my clients that I work with
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   as a financial planner.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   That would be the very best thing.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And if you're a financial advisor
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   or if you're an accountant
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   or if you are a salesperson or anything like that,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   I would encourage you to consistently create
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   some sort of useful, valuable content
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   for your client base.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   That's one way that podcasting can be really, really excellent.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I still have a domain, Financial Advisor Podcast,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   where I want to teach financial advisors
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   how to do a podcast.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   I haven't been able to get that done,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   but that's something that I think all financial advisors
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   really should have a podcast, but not one like mine.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Something different.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   That would be the best way to do it.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   But when I look at what I want to do
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   and kind of what I enjoy doing,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   I don't want to go back to the world
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   of individual financial planning.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   I like doing this.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I like teaching.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I like teaching in public.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   I feel like it's where I feel like my personal skills
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   are the most useful.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   So all this past year, I've tried a little bit of this,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   tried a little bit of that.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   And you've heard all kinds of changes
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   and just frankly a lot of confusion
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   of me trying to figure out, "What am I doing?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   How do I do this?"
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And one of the biggest difficulties
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   with my personality is,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   well, there's strengths and weaknesses.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Most of our character traits can have a strength
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   and also a weakness associated with them.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And unfortunately, they often go together.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   You can't just pick all the strengths
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   and not have the weaknesses.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   You usually have to be at least aware of your weaknesses
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   and higher to your weaknesses is usually the best plan.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Don't try to walk away from who you are,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   but try to higher to your weaknesses.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   So one of my major strengths is I'm a good starter,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   very good at starting things.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And I'm also a good visionary.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I am really, really good at creative thinking.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   I'm really good at seeing the big picture
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   and seeing all of the different ways
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   that I can get somewhere.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And so I'm very, very good at seeing great ideas
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   and I'm very good at thinking about,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   "Oh, I could do that. I could do this.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   I could do the other thing."
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   I'm really good at charting the plan to get there.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   But then about a week later or a month later
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   or six months later,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   I'm very good at seeing the next thing,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   getting distracted by the next thing.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And it's a little bit humbling
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   because when I reflect back on my life thus far,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   I can see how damaging that has been to me
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   to not just stick with something,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   to not stick with something consistently.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   And when you bring that into the world of entrepreneurship,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   that character trait, it's a very difficult character trait
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   because in my experience,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   the most difficult thing about being an entrepreneur
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   is that you have to both decide what to do
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   and then do it.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   There are many days as an entrepreneur
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   where I just long for a boss to tell me what to do,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   someone to say, "Do this."
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I really do.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   But that's not the path that we're on.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   So I've got to figure out what to do and then do it.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   So here are just some focuses for me
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   and some important changes that you should be aware about
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   for the format of the show.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Long-time listeners, you'll know that I have in the past,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   I've gone back and forth
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   with different frequency of publishing of the show.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   This will be one of the biggest changes for 2017.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   In the past, in the first year and a half of the show,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   I did a show just about every weekday.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   I would guess on average, I would do,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   let's say out of three weeks, I would publish 13 shows,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   something like that.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   I was pretty consistent with every weekday having a show.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Now, they weren't all great,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   and I had my reasons why that was important at that time.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   But one of the challenges that I faced
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   with trying to figure out what to do
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   was the thought that, "Well, maybe I'm doing too many shows.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Maybe I should pull back."
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And I had a lot of people, and I needed to pull back
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   because I didn't have a model
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   where I was earning income from the show.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   I didn't have a model where I had the membership site,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   and then that pulled that back,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   and then I moved to Patreon,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   and then I brought on advertisers,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   and then I did fewer advertisers, et cetera.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   I just got back and forth.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   And, well, I got back and forth.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And I had a lot of people that said,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   "Well, you just publish too much content.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   I can't listen to it all."
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   And so there was that constant nagging in the back of my head
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   saying, "Well, maybe I'm publishing too much,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   and maybe I should pull back."
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Well, for 2017, I've decided to go back
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   to the five-day-a-week format.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And there are a few important reasons,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   and I want to share them with you.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   I know that some of you will like that.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Some of you won't.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   I apologize to those of you who don't,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   but it's the right thing for me to do
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   at this point in time.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   And I think it'll really help me,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   and I think it'll really help a lot more people.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Creating the podcast, creating a broadcast,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   is the thing that I feel the most skillful at,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   the thing that I most enjoy doing.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   It's very important to me.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   And I love that I can distribute the content freely,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   and I love that I can be a source of encouragement
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   for many of you as you battle your way through
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   the war field of your journey to financial freedom.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   That's probably my favorite thing.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   And I really love just doing what I'm doing right now,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   sitting down and creating the show.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   And I know because I've gotten hundreds of,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   and even thousands, hundreds of emails
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   from people saying how helpful it has been.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   I love creating the show.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   And so I want to have my primary focus always be there,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   not on everything else, not on,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   let me rephrase that, excuse me.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   I want to have my primary focus to be there,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   at least at this point in time.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Not on trying to create other things,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   not on trying to do all kinds of other things,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   just on creating the show.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   I'm not saying there's not more work,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   more additional areas of focus,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   but I want the show to be primary.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Another thing I've learned is that I just have no way
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   to predict what's popular or successful.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   When I go back through and I look at the analytics,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   and I look at the shows that are the most popular,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   I look at the comments and the feedback that I get,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   many of the shows that have been the most popular
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   over the last couple of years,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   I never would have guessed that they were popular.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Never would have guessed them.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Some of them were the ones that I spent
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   the least time working on.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Some shows I labored on for hours and hours and hours,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   and they didn't move the needle.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Some shows I sat down with a quick idea,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   and they'd been extremely popular.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   So I've learned I just can't predict
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   what's popular or successful,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   but I do know that some percentage of my work
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   will be extremely helpful.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   And in creating, in some ways, more consistent content,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   as long as it's not wandering all over the place,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   I feel I have a better chance of producing more work.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   I also have learned that it's very important for me
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   to have a systematic, consistent schedule.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   And probably the biggest disappointment for me
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   in the last year has been that I've finally recognized,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   yet again, that I don't get any more work done
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   when I have less to do.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Many of the comments that many of you shared with me
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   would go something like this.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   "Joshua, hey, listen, we love having the show,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   "but pull back on the show a little bit
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   "so you have time to do other things."
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   And so I've done that in the past year.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I've published fewer episodes
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   and changed a number of things
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   and pulled back on the format,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   pulled back on the number of shows.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   But I haven't been able to get other things done.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   And it's a little bit funny,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   'cause I'll tell you one story.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   When I was in college, my freshman year of college,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   I was in the honors program
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   at Palm Beach Atlantic University,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   here in West Palm Beach, where I went to school.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   And I took 18 hours of class,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   and it was rigorous, it was pretty difficult.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   It was challenging classes for me.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I was in the honors program,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   so a lot of the literature was challenging.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Also, I was doing calculus and never enjoyed calculus.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   And so it was a challenging semester for me.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   At that point in time also,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   I was working my way through school.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   So I had scholarships and grants
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   that covered a significant portion of my tuition,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   but I had some shortfall.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   And so I wound up,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   for most of my freshman year of college,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   I worked three different jobs.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   I had one job that was kind of an on-campus work-study job,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   which was some bird-brain thing.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   I sat behind a desk, and as I remember,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   I sold candy bags for a dollar
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   and checked people in and out of the residence hall
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   where I lived in exchange for some random low-paying job.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   I did that a couple days a week,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   here and there in the afternoons.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And then on Thursday nights and Friday nights
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   and Saturday afternoon and Saturday night,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   I would ride a bicycle taxi
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   around the downtown in West Palm Beach here.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   It's called City Place.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And so I would ride this bicycle taxi around,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   and that was one of my jobs.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   And then on Saturdays,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   I would do construction for a friend of mine
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   who was building an addition on his house.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   And so Saturdays were tough days.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   I'd go and we'd start work at 7 or 8 in the morning
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   after I'd been up till 2 on Friday morning
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   riding around for the bicycle taxi.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   And then 7 or 8 a.m., we'd start,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   and I'd do construction all day.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   And about 4.30, I'd quit, go take a shower,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   and then ride the bicycle taxi from about 5.30 till 2 a.m.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   So those were long days.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   But I did pretty well.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   I didn't, if I recall correctly,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   I didn't get straight A's,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   but I did A's and a couple B's here and there.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And I did well, and I got through that first year,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   and I didn't have any loans.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   I paid my way through.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Well, I worked a lot,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   and so I decided my second year of school
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   that I needed to have a little bit easier.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And I realized that I could just easily
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   borrow money on student loans,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   and after all, I was going to graduate
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   with a big business degree.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   I was going to make a lot of money.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   And so when I was making a lot of money,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   it would be easy for me to pay those loans back.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   It would be no big deal.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   So I decided to take fewer hours of classes,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   and I decided to work, not at all,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   just to live on student loans.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   So I dropped my course load, I think,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   to 15 hours per semester,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   and it didn't work at all.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   The problem was that my grades went down.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Yeah, I think I hung out a lot.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   I have no idea where that year went.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   My grades went down.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Actually, my second year of school,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   I dropped out of the honors program,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   and so my classes were even easier,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   and I took easier classes.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   My grades went down.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   And again, I don't know what happened to that year.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   I have almost no memories from that year.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   I think I had a lot of fun,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   but I don't remember it.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   My junior year, I studied abroad
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   the fall semester,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   and in the spring I came back
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   and got in a fight with the dean of the business school
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   and dropped out of school.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   And then my senior year is when I went back to school,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   and at that time I wanted to finish
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   and graduate on time in the four years,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   and so I took summer classes,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   and I took 18 hours of class,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   and I was working 40 hours a week.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   And my grades were the best they'd ever been.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   I got straight A's my senior year,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   all of my senior capstone business courses.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   I got straight A's,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   and I learned more that year
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   than I had learned ever in the two previous years combined
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   where I had been on campus.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   I learned so much.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Now, I was busy, but I was structured,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   and I learned a lot.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   And I've never forgotten that lesson,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   that when I was the busiest,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   I learned the most,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   and I actually valued it the most.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   I got the most out of it.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   I had a similar experience
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   when I was working as a financial advisor,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   similar type of thing.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   I was working a lot,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   had a very disciplined schedule,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   things were going good.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Then I started to pull back on the time that I was working,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   and all of a sudden it was like everything pulled back.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   And now, again, in the last year,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   for me and my own personal productivity
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   and my own personal work life,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   the same things happened.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   So I pulled back on the number of shows.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   I haven't been able to build up the other output.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Now, don't get me wrong.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   I'm busy with other things that are important.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   After all, I've got young kids
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   and involved in a lot of things
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   that aren't related to radical personal finance.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   But it's been frustrating to me
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   because I don't feel good
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   when I'm not producing something useful.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   So I'm trying to learn the lesson from that
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   and recognize that the old aphorism,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   "If you want something done, give it to a busy person,"
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   is a common aphorism for a reason.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   It's true.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   If you want something done, give it to a busy person.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   I've recognized that the times in life
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   that I actually feel the best
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   and I feel the most fulfilled
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   is when I'm working the most,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   not in the workaholic sense,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   but in the sense that I have a clear outline
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   that keeps me focused.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And so for my own benefit,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   I want to go back to the consistency
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   that I had in the past.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   And I'll be doing that here in 2017.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Now I want to do that in a couple of changes.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   There's been some other things
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   that I've wanted to do on the show
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   that I didn't feel fit into the statements
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   that I've made in the past.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   For example, 2017, I'm going to cover more current events.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   There have been a lot of interesting events,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   and I think 2017 is going to be a very interesting year.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Very interesting year.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   I don't know what it'll hold, but none of us do,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   but it'll be interesting.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And I want to cover some of those current events.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And I've made the choice not to cover them in the past
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   because I viewed, and I've stated,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   that what I was doing was building a body of work
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   that I wanted to stand as a kind of a standalone thing.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   I've had this dream, a thousand episodes,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   let me just create this thing that can stand there,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   and I've wanted much of the content to be timeless.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Well, I'm changing that.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Some of the content that I'm going to be going forward
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   in the topics are not going to be timeless.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   I'm not anticipating doing a five-day-a-week talk show
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   that's all about current events,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   but probably one out of five or one out of 10 shows,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   I'm going to deal with some current events.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   And I think that'll be important.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   I want to do it.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   I think it'll be helpful to you, the audience.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   I haven't talked about, "Dow at 20,000, what does it mean?"
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   I don't interview people on those subjects,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   but I'm going to do that,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   and I think it'll be helpful.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   So that means that some of the past archives,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   some of these shows will not be as timeless
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   as I've tried to keep most of the content in the past.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   It'll also mean that I'm going to be doing
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   some repetition of topics.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   It's another thing that I've tried not to do.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   I've tried, if I've done a show on a certain topic in the past,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   I've tried not to do that, but the challenge is
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   that I've recognized that's not serving you, my listener,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   in the best way.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Because first, we need repetition.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Repetition is the mother of skill,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   and we need to build that repetition
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   in things that matter.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   But also because the archives are so large,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   many of you listeners now come in and just join,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   but you don't go back and listen to the archives,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   which is fine.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   That's your prerogative.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   But that means you're missing out on important concepts,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   and I know that in show 136, I covered blah, blah, blah,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   but you're never going to get that.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   So there'll be some repetition of topics.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   I'm not--that doesn't mean that I'm going through
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   and going to be recycling and saying,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   "What was the most popular show from episode 200 to 300?"
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   and redoing that, just simply saying that
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   I'm loosening the guidelines that I've given myself in the past.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Also, I'm going to do more interviews.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Based upon time constraints and whatnot,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I pulled back on the number of interviews,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   but I like doing them.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   I know you guys like them,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   and I've got a long list of people I'd like to interview,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   so I'm going to be doing more of those as well.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And here's probably the biggest thing that you'll see
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   starting on tomorrow's show,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   is I'm going to be bringing in, incorporating,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   many more ads here on Radical Personal Finance,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   and a couple of changes with that.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I've had a love-hate relationship with ads in the past.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   I've done them, and sometimes I like them,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   sometimes I didn't like them.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   I've been very conflicted over it for various reasons.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   But at this point in time,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   in the last year,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   because I pretty much did very few ads,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   I walked past about six figures in revenue
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   for Radical Personal Finance for my business.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   And I did it because I thought
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   that I could make it up in other areas,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   but I haven't made it up in other areas.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   And I've just come to the conviction,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   especially with a third child on the way,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   it's not fair to my family.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   It's not fair to me, and it's not fair to my family,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   for me to walk away from six figures of revenue
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   because of bringing on ads.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Now, the deep concern that I have had in the past
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   was how to do it in an ethical way,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   especially since I'm doing ads that are reads of my voice.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   And what I realized is that a lot of it
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   was just simply due to years of being hounded on
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   as a financial advisor.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   One of the things that's very difficult,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   those of you who are in the business will recognize,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   or if you're not, you can recognize,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   financial advisors are not, well,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   the public perception of people
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   who go by the name of financial advisors is pretty low.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   That can be difficult.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   It can be difficult psychologically
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   when you're constantly kind of stomped on a little bit,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   especially if you came from the type of business
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   that I came from where I started off my career
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   selling life insurance.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   And it takes a lot.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Life insurance salespeople probably don't often
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   have the best self-image.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Now, today, I see the value of life insurance,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   and I could very happily say I sell life insurance.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   But when I was starting, I couldn't do that.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   And then there are so many conflicts,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   and people are so consistent about,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   well, you make all your money on commissions,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   so therefore you do the wrong thing.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And then when you do finance,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   and well, you make all your money on commissions and fees,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   and financial advisor and broker,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   and it's expensive and blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   And I think that there was a lot of that.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Because I started in the business so young,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   I didn't have the perspective of maturity
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   where I was really confident in the value that I brought.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   And when I left in July of 2014
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   to start Radical Personal Finance,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   it was kind of like a big relief for me
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   to finally be away from the perceived
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   conflicts of interest.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   It was psychologically a big deal.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And with ads, my fear was,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   well, I don't want to go back into that thing
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   where people say, well, Josh was on the take
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   for such and such.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And Josh was, I don't want to go back to the place
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   where Josh was filtering his opinions
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   because of, you know, advertiser XYZ.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   So I've dealt with that over the past year
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   and kind of worked through all that
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   and thought it through.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   And I guess in short,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   I don't believe I can not do ads at this point in time.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Because ads can be very valuable and useful things.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   They can present us with information that's helpful
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   and that's useful.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   And the other, you know,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   and I'm a little bit tongue-tied
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   just simply because a lot of it is just personally
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   kind of, it's humbling just to realize, well,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   all those things that I said,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   that it was my pride that was involved.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   My pride of wanting to say,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   well, I'm not on the take for anybody.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   I'm beholden to no man.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Here I am.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   And it's humbling just to recognize
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   when you have that much pride about something,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   but also to recognize the source.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   So bringing that all together is that
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   I'm going to be doing ads on radical personal finance.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   There's going to be a great variety.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Some of them will be financial.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Some of them won't.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   I'm working with a rep,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   an ad rep who will be helping me bring advertising in.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   I'm going to be going ahead and getting back
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   to some of you who've contacted me
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   about potentially advertising on the show.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   And I basically kind of said, well,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   and hemmed and hawed and didn't give you rates
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   and didn't do any of those things.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   And you'll be hearing a lot of ads going forward
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   on radical personal finance.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Because I really think, you know,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   in thinking about it,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   I think that'll be the very best way
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   for me to focus on and bring you
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   what I'm really good at bringing you.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   And to really focus on that,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   doing it better, doing it more professionally,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   and also building up the revenue that I need
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   to be able to hire to my weaknesses,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   to be able to expand the team
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   here at radical personal finance,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   to be able to hire to my weaknesses
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   so I can do a better job serving more people.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   And also to help my family,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   because it's not fair to my family,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   to my children and to my wife,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   for me to maintain my pride
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   in some kind of arrogant way of,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   I'm beholden to no one.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   It just doesn't work.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   So I'll be bringing more ads on in the future.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Those are the basic things for the show
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   for you to be aware of.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Personally, I just shared,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   those of you who are interested,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   just a few things that I've recognized
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   that have been real problems
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   in my own personal habits over the last year.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   One of the major focuses for me going forward in 2017
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   is I'm gonna be doing much more reading of books
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   and less time on the internet.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   My reading habits have significantly
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   deteriorated this past year.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   And it's really frustrating to me
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   because what I've realized is
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   when I stop reading, I stop growing.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   And then I don't feel like I have anything to give.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   I don't have fresh information.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   And that happened a lot with me this past year.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Because I stopped reading as much,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   I stopped being as inspired,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   and I felt like I was draining my reserves
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   of ideas and of energy and of excitement.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   And just, I kind of felt like it was same old, same old.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   So for me, a big focus for this next year
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   is doing more reading
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   and just spending less time on the internet.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   The internet is an incredible blessing,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   but to me it's also been an incredible source of stress.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   And so walking away from a lot of it,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   just gonna be spending more time me,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   me and authors, reading books,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   talking with authors through their books.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   And I'm excited about that.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   I'm gonna be spending a lot more time thinking and creating,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   and I'm just gonna allow less noise in.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   The election of this past year,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   as much as I worked so hard to stay away from it,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   but still it just kind of sucks you in, right?
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   I think we're probably, many of us are guilty of that.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   My wife is so good at staying under,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   she says, "I live under a rock.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   I don't want to know about that stuff."
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   And I'm so jealous of her sometimes
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   because my character is too weak and I get sucked in
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   and I want to read this and I want to get involved.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   But man, is all that noise stressful.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   I want to spend more time thinking
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   and more time creating this year.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   And then back to the area of focus,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   recognizing that lack of focus has been,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   has really hurt me in this past year.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   I am forcing simplicity onto myself.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And I just give like a very simple example.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   I have a love-hate relationship with task lists
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   and to-do lists and productivity systems, et cetera.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   I am an idea person.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   I can come up with ideas so quickly.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And I also have a great deal of confidence
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   in my ability to execute on ideas.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   So I am so good at giving myself things to do.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   And when I build out,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   if I go through a goal-setting exercise
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   or I build out a productivity system
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   or something like that,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   I can fill that thing up so quickly.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   And so what happens is I'll sit down
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   and I'll start organizing myself
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   and I'll create projects and goals
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   and sub-projects and task lists
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   and things like that.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   And before you know it,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   I got 400 things on my to-do list.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   And then I become so overwhelmed by it
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   that I just delete the whole system,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   throw the whole thing away and start fresh.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   It's a common cycle over about every six months.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Well, that's not helpful.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   That hasn't been helpful to me.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   So I'm forcing this year a lot of simplicity on myself.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   I am not permitting myself
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   to use any kind of digital list-making system.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Rather, I'm forcing myself to keep it entirely written.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   And so I've been doing this for a few months,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   but it's so helpful to me.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   But I'm forcing myself to write my to-do list manually
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   on paper with pen and paper
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   and then to rewrite it about every few days.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   That way, I have to face the things
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   that I have on there and say,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   "Do I really want to do this
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   or is this just one of your,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   you know, Joshua, this is just one of your great ideas?"
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   If I really want to do it, then I can rewrite it.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   But if not, what happens, I get tired of writing it
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   and I can just go ahead and scratch it off.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   That's been really, really helpful for me.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   So those are some simple areas for me
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   that are big areas of focus for me.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   I have some significant goals in 2017.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Very excited about this year that's coming up.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   And I'm looking forward to sharing it with you.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   I'm so excited.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   I could go into so many more things, different type.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   I'm going to do more book reviews.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   I'm going to do more author interviews.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   I've got a lot of exciting plans for this year.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   I'm trying to keep some of those ideas out
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   and just let them come.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   I just wanted to basically share
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   those important announcements with you
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   so that you would be in the loop
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   and not surprised with some of the changes
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   over the coming days.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   2017 is going to be a great year.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   I look forward to sharing it with you.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   I hope that many hundreds of you have been joining
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   the Radical Personal Finance Facebook group.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Thank you for that.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Some awesome discussions going on.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   I hope you guys are appreciating that way
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   of connecting with one another.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   And I'm going to continue growing here
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   in a scalable way.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Thank you for your patience with me as I'm learning.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   It's very humbling to have all your learning
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   in front of thousands of people.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   It's very humbling.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   But the commitment that I made at the beginning
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   is I'm trying to stick through it,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   which is why I'm sharing some of these things with you,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   is to share the good and the bad.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   Share the real.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   If we have the ability to communicate with people
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   and they put up walls,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   then how is that helpful?
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   What happens is you wind up thinking
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   that you're the only person.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Entrepreneurial endeavors are tough.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Seth Godin wrote a book called "The Dip."
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   And in many ways, my hope, I think,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   this last year for me has been the dip.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   I hope it was the dip.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   I hope that means we're on the upside there.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   But that's life.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   Life is not all straight.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   It's not all straight compound growth.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   It's not always fantastic.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   There's a lot of learning along the way.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   And I hope that you're going to be able to
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   take some of my lessons.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Be back with you tomorrow.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   If I miss tomorrow's show,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   it's just simply due to the fact that I was sick today.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   And my apologies.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   But I plan to do a show on RVs.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   And I'll share with you just some of the things
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   that I've learned,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   especially the last two weeks traveling with my family.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   I love RVs.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   I think they're awesome.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   And I've got some radical ideas around them
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   that I think will be helpful.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Then I will do that with a couple of...
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   I'll share with you a couple of interviews.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   And thank you for being with me.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   I'm excited about the coming year.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   And I thank you for listening
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   and for walking on this journey with me.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   I will keep doing everything I can
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   to improve and to get better,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   to serve you more effectively
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   on your path to financial freedom,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   to walk with you each and every day.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Thank you for your patience.
