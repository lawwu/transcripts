[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:42.640]   And then we got down one day to the point, that was the second or third day, to talk about, uh, where they lived and how much they were earning.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:49.060]   And when those brothers told me what they were earning, I said, "Now, you know what?"

The God that I worship has a way of saying don't play with me. He has a way of saying as the God of the Old Testament used to say. The Hebrews don't play with me. Don't play with me Babylon.
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:18:08.940]   Be still and know that I'm God. If you don't stop your reckless course I'll rise up and break the backbone of your power. That can happen to America. Every now and then I go back and read Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. And when I come and look at America I say to myself the parallels are frightening. We have perverted the Roman Empire.
