[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.880]   The presence of this instinct explains why we are so often taken by advertisers.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.880]   You know, those gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.520]   And they have a way of saying things to you that kind of gets you in the bind.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.680]   In order to be a man of distinction, you must drink this whiskey.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.240]   In order to make your neighbors envious, you must drive this type of car.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:06.120]   In order to be lovely to love, you must wear this kind of lipstick or this kind of perfume.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.960]   And you know before you know it, you're just buying that stuff.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.400]   That's the way the advertisers do it.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.840]   I got a letter the other day and it was a magazine coming out and it opened up, opened
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.200]   up, "Dear Dr. King, as you know you are on many mailing lists and you are categorized
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.440]   as highly intelligent, progressive, a lover of the arts and the sciences, and I know you
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.160]   will want to read what I have to say."
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.160]   Of course I did.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.320]   After you said all of that and explained me so exactly, of course I wanted to read it.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.480]   But very seriously, it goes through life.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.760]   The drum major instinct is real.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.520]   And you know what else that happens or causes to happen?
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.400]   It often causes us to live above our means.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.040]   (Make it plain, make it plain.)
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.640]   It's nothing but the drum major instinct.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.640]   (Yeah)
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:14.360]   You ever see people buy cars that they can't even begin to buy in terms of their income?
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.560]   You've seen people riding around in Cadillacs and Chryslers who aren't enough to have a
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.760]   good T Model 4.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.240]   (Make it plain, make it plain.)
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.880]   But it feeds a repressed ego.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.760]   You know, economists tell us that your automobile should not cost more than half of your annual
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.760]   income.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.040]   So if you make an income of five thousand dollars, your car shouldn't cost more than
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.360]   about twenty-five hundred.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.800]   That's just good economics.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.040]   And if it's a family of two and both members of the family make ten thousand dollars, they
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.680]   would have to make out with one car.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.360]   That would be good economics, although it's often inconvenient.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.080]   But so often, haven't you seen people making five thousand dollars a year and driving a
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.360]   car that costs six thousand?
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.600]   And they wonder why their ends never meet.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.560]   That's a fact.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.400]   Now the economists also say that your house shouldn't cost—if you're buying a house,
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.600]   it shouldn't cost more than twice your income.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.480]   That's based on the economy and how you would make ends meet.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.200]   So if you have an income of five thousand dollars—it's kind of difficult in this
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.160]   society—but say it's a family with an income of ten thousand dollars, the house
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.480]   shouldn't cost much more than twenty thousand.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.160]   But I've seen folk making ten thousand dollars living in forty- and fifty-thousand-dollar
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.120]   houses.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.120]   And you know, they just barely make it.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.920]   They get a check every month somewhere, and they owe all of that out before it comes in.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.320]   Never have anything to put away for rainy days.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.760]   But now the problem is, it is the drum-major instinct.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.680]   And you know, you see people over and over again with the drum-major instinct taking
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.360]   them over, and they just live their lives trying to outdo the gentleman.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.640]   They got to get this coat because this particular coat is a little better and a little better
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.640]   looking than Mary's coat.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:36.160]   And I've got to drive this car because it's something about this car that makes my car
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.080]   a little better than my neighbor's car.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.640]   I know a man who used to live in a thirty-five-thousand-dollar house, and other people started building thirty-five-thousand-dollar
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:53.320]   houses, so he built a seventy-five-thousand-dollar house, and then somebody else built a seventy-five-thousand-dollar
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.680]   house, and he built a hundred-thousand-dollar house, and I don't know where he's going
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.400]   to end up if he's going to live his life trying to keep up with the Joneses.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:12.320]   There comes a time that the drum-major instinct can become destructive.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.360]   And that's where I want to move now.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:25.880]   I want to move to the point of saying that if this instinct is not harnessed, it becomes
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.400]   a very dangerous, pernicious instinct.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.960]   For instance, if it isn't harnessed, it causes one's personality to become distorted.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:44.640]   I guess that's the most damaging aspect of it, what it does to the personality.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:53.760]   If it isn't harnessed, you will end up, day in and day out, trying to deal with your ego
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.640]   problem by boasting.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.600]   Have you ever heard people that, you know—and I'm sure you've met them—that really become
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:09.680]   sickening because they just sit up all the time talking about themselves, and they just
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:19.520]   boast and boast and boast, and that's a person who has not harnessed the drum-major instinct.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.720]   And then it does other things to the personality.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.720]   It causes you to lie about who you know sometimes.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:36.560]   There are some people who are influence peddlers, and in that attempt to deal with the drum-major
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.320]   instinct, they have to try to identify with the so-called big-name people.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:49.480]   And if you're not careful, they will make you think they know somebody that they don't
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.480]   really know.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.640]   They know them well, they sip tea with them, and they this and that.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.840]   That happens to people.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:06.840]   And the other thing is that it causes one to engage, ultimately, in activities that
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.720]   are merely used to get attention.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.200]   Criminologists tell us that some people are driven to crime because of this drum-major
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.880]   instinct.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.120]   They don't feel that they're getting enough attention through the normal channels of social
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:29.600]   behavior, and so they turn to antisocial behavior in order to get attention, in order to feel
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   important.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   And so they get that gun, and before they know it, they rob the bank in a quest for
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.840]   recognition and a quest for importance.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:49.180]   And then the final great tragedy of the distorted personality is the fact that when one fails
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:56.760]   to harness this instinct, he ends up trying to push others down in order to push himself
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.760]   up.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.320]   And whenever you do that, you engage in some of the most vicious activities.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:09.360]   You will spread evil, vicious, lying gossip on people because you are trying to pull them
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.840]   down in order to push yourself up.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:19.400]   And the great issue of life is to harness the drum-major instinct.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:28.440]   Now, the other problem is, when you don't harness the drum-major instinct, this uncontrolled
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:34.040]   aspect of it is that it leads to snobbish exclusivism.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:39.760]   It leads to snobbish exclusivism.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:51.080]   Now, you know, this is the danger of social clubs and fraternities—I'm in a fraternity,
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.640]   I'm in two or three—for sororities and all of these.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.440]   I'm not talking against them, I'm saying it's the danger.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:10.400]   The danger is that they can become forces of classism and exclusivism, where somehow
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   you get a degree of satisfaction because you are in something exclusive, and that's fulfilling
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   something, you know.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.920]   And I'm in this fraternity, and it's the best fraternity in the world, and everybody can't
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.000]   get in this fraternity.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.400]   So it ends up, you know, a very exclusive kind of thing.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.320]   And you know, that can happen with the church.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.440]   I know churches get in that bind sometimes.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.720]   (Yes, yes, they get plain luke.)
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:45.120]   I've been to churches, you know, and they say, "We have so many doctors and so many
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:54.820]   schoolteachers and so many lawyers and so many businessmen in our church."
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.320]   And that's fine, because doctors need to go to church, and lawyers and businessmen, teachers,
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.000]   they ought to be in church.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.040]   But they say that—even the preacher sometimes will go all through that—they say that as
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:13.560]   if the other people don't count.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:20.080]   The church is the one place where the doctor ought to forget that he's a doctor.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.560]   The church is the one place where the Ph.D. ought to forget that he's a Ph.D.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:29.360]   The church is the one place that the schoolteacher ought to forget the degree she has behind
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.360]   her name.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.400]   The church is the one place where the lawyer ought to forget that he's a lawyer.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:42.520]   And any church that violates the "whosoever will let him come" doctrine is a dead, cold
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.400]   church, and nothing but a little soldier with a fiendishness of religiosity.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.600]   The church is true to its job.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.440]   It says, "Whosoever will let him come."
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.960]   It says, "Whosoever will let him come."
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:03.320]   And it does not suppose to satisfy the perverted uses of the drum major instinct.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:10.080]   It's the one place where everybody should be the same, standing before a common master
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.080]   and savior.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:18.800]   And a recognition grows out of this that all men are brothers because they are children
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   of a common father.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.520]   The drum major instinct leads to exclusivist wanting.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:32.160]   The drum major instinct can lead one to feel that because he has some training, he's a
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.200]   little better than that person who doesn't have it.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.360]   Or because he has some economic security, that he's a little better than that person
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.800]   who doesn't have it.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:47.320]   That's the uncontrolled, perverted use of the drum major instinct.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:56.080]   Now the other thing is that it leads to tragic, and we've seen it happen so often, tragic
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.200]   race prejudice.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.880]   This recording is briefly interrupted at this point.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:10.720]   We see with our own eyes, in fact not too long ago a man down in Mississippi said that
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:19.800]   God was a charter member of the White Citizens Council.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   And so God being the charter member means that everybody who's in that has a kind of
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.160]   divinity, a kind of superiority.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:36.720]   And think of what has happened in history as a result of this perverted use of the drum
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:43.240]   major instinct that has led to the most tragic prejudice, the most tragic expressions of
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.720]   man's inhumanity to man.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:57.360]   The other day I was saying, I always try to do a little converting when I'm in jail.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:05.440]   And when we were in jail in Birmingham the other day, the white wardens and all enjoyed
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.760]   coming around the cell to talk about the race problem.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:15.160]   And they were showing us where we were so wrong demonstrating, and they were showing
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:23.760]   us where segregation was so right, and they were showing us where intermarriage was so
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   wrong.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.920]   So I would get to preaching, and we would get to talking calmly because they wanted
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.520]   to talk about it.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:39.280]   And then we got down one day to the point—that was the second or third day—to talk about
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.120]   where they lived and how much they were earning.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:49.400]   And when those brothers told me what they were earning, I said, "Now you know what?
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.920]   You ought to be marching with us.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.600]   You just as poor as Negro."
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:07.760]   And I said, "You are put in the position of supporting your oppressor, because through
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:14.640]   prejudice and blindness you fail to see that the same forces that oppress Negroes in American
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.760]   society oppress poor white people.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:24.640]   And all you are living on is the satisfaction of your skin being white and the drum-major
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.040]   instinct of thinking that you are somebody big because you're white.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.560]   And you're so poor you can't send your children to school.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:36.360]   You ought to be out here marching with every one of us every time we have a march."
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.600]   Now that's the fact.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:46.040]   The poor white has been put into this position where through blindness and prejudice he is
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:52.560]   forced to support his oppressors, and all the things he has gone for him is the false
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:58.080]   feeling that he is superior because his skin is white and can hardly eat and make his ends
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.400]   meet week in and week out.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:10.360]   Not only does it stop, and not only does this thing go into the racial struggle, it goes
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.080]   into the struggle between nations.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.240]   And I would submit to you this morning that what is wrong in the world today is that the
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:23.320]   nations of the world are engaged in a bitter, colossal contest for supremacy.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:31.640]   And if something doesn't happen to stop this trend, I'm sorely afraid that we won't be
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:39.320]   here to talk about Jesus Christ and about God and about brotherhood too many more years.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:49.080]   If somebody doesn't bring an end to this suicidal thrust that we see in the world today, none
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:54.640]   of us are going to be around, because somebody is going to make the mistake through our senseless
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:16:00.400]   blundering of dropping a nuclear bomb somewhere, and then another one is going to drop.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.280]   And don't let anybody fool you.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.800]   This can happen within a matter of seconds.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:12.720]   They have twenty-megaton bombs in Russia right now that can destroy a city as big as New
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.200]   York in three seconds, with everybody wiped away and every building.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.680]   And we can do the same thing to Russian China.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:25.080]   But this is why we are drifting, and we are drifting there, because nations are caught
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:31.880]   up with the drum-major instinct, "I must be first, I must be supreme, our nation must
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.880]   rule the world."
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:41.400]   And I am sad to say that the nation in which we live is the supreme culprit.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:47.520]   And I'm going to continue to say it to America, because I love this country too much to see
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.280]   the drift that it has taken.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.720]   God didn't call America to do what she's doing in the world now.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:03.400]   God didn't call America to engage in a senseless, unjust war as the war in Vietnam.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.040]   And we are criminals in that war.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.120]   We have committed more war crimes almost than any nation in the world, and I'm going to
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.920]   continue to say it.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:17.160]   And we won't stop it because of our pride and our arrogance as a nation.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.400]   But God has a way of even putting nations in their place.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:27.440]   And the God that I worship has a way of saying, "Don't play with me."
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:35.120]   He has a way of saying, as the God of the Old Testament used to say to the Hebrews,
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.120]   "Don't play with me, Israel.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.120]   Don't play with me, Babylon.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.120]   Be still and know that I'm God.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:49.720]   And if you don't stop your reckless course, I'll rise up and break the backbone of your
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.720]   power."
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.120]   And that can happen to America.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:00.320]   Every now and then I go back and read Gibbons' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, and
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:07.120]   when I come and look at America, I say to myself, "The parallels are frightening."
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:13.680]   We have perverted the drummage instinct.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:24.560]   Let me rush on to my conclusion, because I want you to see what Jesus was really saying.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.720]   What was the answer that Jesus gave these men?
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.520]   It's very interesting.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:36.240]   One would have thought that Jesus would have condemned them.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:42.960]   One would have thought that Jesus would have said, "You are out of your place.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.480]   You are selfish.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.000]   Why would you raise such a question?"
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.920]   That isn't what Jesus did.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.480]   He did something altogether different.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.800]   He said in substance, "Oh, I see.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.940]   You want to be first.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.320]   You want to be great.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.480]   You want to be important.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.440]   You want to be significant.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.880]   Well, you ought to be.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:21.800]   If you want to be my disciple, you must be."
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:29.080]   He reordered priorities, and he said, "Yes, don't give up this instinct.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.760]   It's a good instinct if you use it right.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.320]   It's a good instinct if you don't distort it and pervert it.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.040]   Don't give it up.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.080]   Keep feeling the need for being important.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.080]   Keep feeling the need for being first.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   But I want you to be first in love.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.200]   I want you to be first in moral excellence.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.600]   I want you to be first in generosity.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.320]   That is what I want you to do."
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:08.840]   He transformed the situation by giving a new definition of greatness.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.080]   And you know how he said it?
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:20.240]   He said, "Now, brethren, I can't give you greatness, and really, I can't make you first."
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.880]   This is what Jesus said to James and John.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.880]   "You must earn it.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:34.840]   True greatness comes not by favoritism but by fitness.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:47.360]   The right hand and the left are not mine to give; they belong to those who are prepared."
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.520]   And so Jesus gave us a new norm of greatness.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.620]   If you want to be important, wonderful.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.040]   If you want to be recognized, wonderful.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.360]   If you want to be great, wonderful.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:07.680]   But recognize that "he who is greatest among you shall be your servant."
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.240]   That's a new definition of greatness.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:16.840]   This morning, the thing that I like about it, by giving that definition of greatness,
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:23.400]   it means that everybody can be great, because everybody can serve.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.640]   You don't have to have a college degree to serve.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:35.400]   You don't have to make your subject and your verb agree to serve.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.000]   You don't have to know about Plato and Aristotle to serve.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.840]   You don't have to know Einstein's theory of relativity to serve.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:51.880]   You don't have to know the second theory of thermodynamics in physics to serve.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:22:09.120]   You only need a heart full of grace, a soul generated by love, and you can be that servant.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:16.520]   I know a man, and I just want to talk about him a minute, and maybe you will discover
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:23.680]   who I'm talking about as I go down the way, because he was a great one.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.440]   He just went about serving.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:39.080]   He was born in an obscure village, the child of a poor peasant woman.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:49.560]   Then he grew up in still another obscure village, where he worked as a carpenter until he was
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.720]   thirty years old.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:23:02.920]   Then for three years, he just got on his feet, and he was an itinerant preacher.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.080]   And he went about doing some things.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.920]   He didn't have much; he never wrote a book.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.200]   He never held an office.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.920]   He never had a family.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.160]   He never owned a house.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.160]   He never went to college.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:27.080]   He never visited a big city.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:33.840]   He never went two hundred miles from where he was born.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:40.000]   He did none of the usual things that the world would associate with greatness.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.680]   He had no credentials but himself.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   He was only a little one.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.680]   The eye of the public began to look at him.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.600]   They called him a rouse.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:57.320]   They turned against him.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.440]   They called him a rabble-rouser.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.280]   They called him a troublemaker.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.280]   They said he was an agitator.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.840]   He practiced civil disobedience.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.360]   He broke injunctions.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:19.880]   And so he was turned over to his enemies and went through the mockery of a trial.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:26.740]   And the irony of it all is that his friends turned him over to them.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.160]   One of his closest friends denied him.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:36.480]   Another of his friends turned him over to his enemies.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:46.680]   And while he was dying, the people who killed him gambled for his clothing, the only possession
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.720]   that he had in the world.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:58.300]   When he was dead, he was buried in a barraton through the pity of a friend.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:03.460]   Nineteen centuries have come and gone.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:12.260]   Today he stands as the most influential figure that ever entered human history.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:22.320]   All the armies that ever marched, all the navies that ever sailed, all the pirates that
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.320]   ever stood, all kings that ever went to jail, and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven,
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.320]   and all the pharaohs that ever went to hell, and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven,
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.320]   and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven, and all the pharaohs that ever went to hell,
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven, and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven,
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.320]   and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven, and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven,
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.320]   and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven, and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven,
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.320]   and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven, and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven,
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:55.560]   and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven, and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven,
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:23.400]   and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven, and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven,
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:53.240]   and all the pharaohs that ever went to heaven.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:59.360]   I think about my own death, and I think about my own funeral, and I don't think of it in
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.360]   a morbid sense.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:07.680]   Every now and then I ask myself, "What is it that I would want said?"
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.640]   And I leave the word to you this morning.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:20.320]   If any of you are around, when I have to meet my day, I don't want a long funeral.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:26.080]   And if you get somebody to deliver the eulogy, tell them not to talk too long.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.560]   Every now and then I wonder what I want them to say.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:34.000]   Tell them not to mention that I have a Nobel Peace Prize, that isn't important.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.320]   Tell them not to mention that I have three or four hundred other awards, that's not important.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.920]   Tell them not to mention where I went to school.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:49.560]   I'd like somebody to mention that day that Martin Luther King, Jr. tried to give his
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.240]   life serving others.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:59.080]   I'd like for somebody to say that day that Martin Luther King, Jr. tried to love somebody.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:04.480]   I want you to say that day that I tried to be right on the wall question.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:11.000]   I want you to be able to say that day that I did try to feed the hungry.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.280]   I want you to be able to say that day that I did try in my life to clothe those who were
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.280]   naked.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:25.080]   I want you to say on that day that I did try in my life to visit those who were imprisoned.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:30.560]   I want you to say that I tried to love and serve humanity.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:37.920]   Yes, if you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:44.000]   Say that I was a drum major for peace, I was a drum major for righteousness, and all of
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.440]   the other shallow things will not matter.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.440]   I won't have any money to leave behind.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:57.560]   I won't have the fine and luxurious things of life to leave behind, but I just want to
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.680]   leave a committed life behind.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.080]   And that's all I want to say.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:10.560]   If I can help somebody as I pass along, if I can cheer somebody with a war song, if I
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:17.440]   can show somebody he's traveling wrong, then my living will not be in vain.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:24.400]   If I can do my duty as a Christian, or if I can bring salvation to a world once wrought,
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:32.360]   if I can spread the message as the Master taught, then my living will not be in vain.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:39.440]   Yes, Jesus, I want to be on your right or your left side, not for any selfish reason.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:46.160]   I want to be on your right or your left side, not in terms of some political kingdom or
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:54.840]   position, but I just want to be there in love and in justice and in truth and in commitment
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:06.760]   to others so that we can make of this old world a new world.
