[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   My response to all of this is, and I say this with all modesty, I told you so.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.820]   I've been saying this for years.
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.480]   As one of the few people who is orbiting this world but has never been an active Twitter
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.760]   user, I'm telling you from the outside, this metaphorical dinner party got weird a long
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.260]   time ago.
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:36.900]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, the show about living and working deeply in
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.020]   an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.700]   I'm here in my deep work HQ.
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.780]   There's no Jesse today.
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.900]   Quick backstory on that.
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.340]   I'm just about to leave for a quick trip to San Francisco.
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.700]   I'm going to be speaking on a panel about generative artificial intelligence.
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.780]   Those who listened to last week's episode or read my recent New Yorker article know
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.780]   that I do have a few thoughts on that subject.
[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.660]   Anyways, because my week leading up to this trip was correspondingly crowded to make up
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.580]   for the mixed time, I had this great idea that I would record the podcast in San Francisco
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.940]   itself.
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.660]   This idea seemed good until the trip got closer and then it seemed less good.
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.740]   The backstory here, and there's really a teaching moment to extract from this, the backstory
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.540]   is I've been pretty overloaded this spring.
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.180]   I engineer my schedule typically so that the steady state is very reasonable.
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.980]   But it's a bit of a Rube Goldberg machine to keep the steady state reasonable involving
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.100]   carefully calibrated rotations of different types of projects.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.940]   I'm only working on one at a time typically, so it's not so bad, but it's very complicated
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.860]   to keep things in the wings and interleave them.
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.420]   It's not unusual, as I've talked about on the show, to have a couple of weeks typically
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.380]   in the spring or maybe a few things overlap and it's a little bit busier than normal.
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.700]   Also professors tend to be more exhausted with teaching by the end of the academic year
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.100]   than the beginning.
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.940]   This year, the Goldberg machine collapsed and then it accidentally caught on fire.
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.060]   And then the fire let the building on fire, which then collapsed.
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.460]   And then that got hit by lightning.
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.340]   At least that's what it feels like sometimes.
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.460]   Multiple things have just sustainably remained stacked on top of each other.
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.500]   And it's not a two week period after which you recover, but it's been week after week
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.700]   and almost I'm almost in the clear, but it's been pretty exhausting.
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.620]   So as this trip was looming, I started thinking, you know what?
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.620]   I want to just travel.
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.140]   Let me get there.
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.380]   Enjoy the fact I can fly across the country without three young kids with me.
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.380]   That's great.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.100]   Read, maybe do a little writing.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.700]   I can't help myself from writing.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.980]   I got to always be writing.
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.300]   Just do the thing, do the panel, walk around the city.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.740]   You know, last time I was in San Francisco, I believe this was last year around this time,
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.260]   I had a lot of downtime.
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.500]   I walked all over the city.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   It's great.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.500]   It's great.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.340]   So anyways, I was like, I don't want to bring my equipment.
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.300]   I don't want to have another thing on my to do list.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.860]   I want to treat the trip as a break from the overload that I've accidentally temporarily
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.860]   fell into.
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.860]   So I said, you know what?
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.340]   I have a little window now between I just got home from teaching and I'm about to go
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.500]   to my kid's soccer practice.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.100]   Like let's get in there.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.100]   Let's make it happen.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.340]   So I didn't have time to arrange for Jesse to be here.
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.100]   So we'll be back to normal next week, but that's what's going on.
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.820]   So there's a little lesson in there about, I don't know, stepping back, recognizing the
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.340]   unsustainability of overload, recognizing the value of periods of time that aren't trying
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.460]   to be too scheduled, aren't trying to be too overscheduled.
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.940]   So hopefully this trip will end up being somewhat recharging.
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.940]   So we'll see.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.940]   All right.
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.940]   So what's the plan for today?
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.940]   I have a deep dive.
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.940]   We'll start with a deep dive.
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.900]   I want to react to a article I read recently that I really enjoyed.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.140]   I thought it was very perceptive and we'll do questions and then we'll end with something
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.140]   interesting.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.200]   But here's the twist for today.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:15.900]   I'm doing something that I may regret with the questions, a approximated and elaborated
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.420]   version of what I used to call question roulette.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.140]   I used to in the old version of this show, randomly select a question and just answer
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.580]   it on the fly without preparation.
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.700]   I'm going to do the whole, the whole segment that way.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.900]   I've got my spreadsheet in front of me of questions that you have submitted to SurveyMonkey
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.700]   to the link that's included on the show notes.
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.840]   Nancy takes those out of SurveyMonkey and puts them into a spreadsheet so I can annotate
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   them, et cetera.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.240]   I'm just going to scroll through and grab things.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.080]   And when it gets to the questions, we're going to rock and roll.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.240]   So who knows where we're going to end up?
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.440]   Who knows what weird cul-de-sacs we're going to go into?
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.840]   I'm doing this all one take.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.420]   I'm doing things without prep.
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.960]   So we're going to cover some ground.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.160]   We might get to some weird places.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.400]   There's a 30% chance I'll end up canceled after this done and a 20% chance that you
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.440]   will unsubscribe from this podcast out of frustration.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.960]   But that leaves a 50% chance that we'll do something brilliant.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.960]   So I'm excited about that.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.560]   All right, well, let's start with a deep dive.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.440]   I want to talk about an article from the New York Times from April 18th, the day before
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.280]   I'm recording this show.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.960]   It's an article from the New York Times Magazine written by an editor over there named Willie
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.360]   Staley, and it's titled, "What was Twitter Anyway?"
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.760]   I don't typically love Twitter reporting as a self-critical reporting on Twitter.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.480]   I don't usually love that format.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:42.600]   I don't always care what sort of in-the-weed Twitter users have to say about Twitter because,
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   I don't know.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:52.480]   It's like talking to the alcoholic about the difference between different brown liquors
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.160]   and the buzz they create or something.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.400]   It's like someone whose life is so involved in it, it can be kind of weird.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   This article was great.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.240]   It was a Twitter article I was waiting for a journalist to write because I think it is
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.240]   incisive at getting at, here is how Twitter unfolded.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.880]   Here is why me, reporter William Staley, and everyone I know was using this so much, and
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.400]   here's what's happening now, why that party is coming to an end.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.160]   So I'm going to go through this and then react to it a little bit.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.000]   Now, if Jesse was here, we would load this up on the screen.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.400]   He's not here.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.320]   I don't know how to use technology, so I have it printed out.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.400]   I'm actually just going to be reading things.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.880]   You can, however, watch me.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.120]   Can I, however, watch me reading this article at youtube.com/Cal Newport Media?
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.480]   This is episode 245.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.000]   You can also find this episode at the deep life.com.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.480]   If you just click on watch and go to episode 245, you'll find the video there as well.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.520]   I have a couple of quotes I want to read.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.880]   Let's start with who William Staley is.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.920]   As he says early in the article, I am an editor at the New York Times Magazine, but I think
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.160]   I should be, it should be stated clearly up front that I have something of an acute problem
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.160]   with Twitter.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.400]   So he puts that up there right up front.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:10.360]   He gives an interesting anecdote about getting involved in a pile on.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.920]   So it was a little bit hard for me to follow, but I think what happened here is that La
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.880]   Crusade that makes the enameled cast iron cookware famous for, I don't know, wedding
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.000]   registries everywhere, sort of expensive French cookware had advertised something about Star
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.200]   Wars themed La Crusade cookware.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.320]   And he thought that was incongruous.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.160]   He thinks about that as something that people who are really refined people into cooking
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.200]   care about and Star Wars, he thinks about maybe comic book geeks.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:47.360]   And so he wrote a tweet that said the Star Wars La Crusade pots implied the existence
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.960]   of a type of guy I find genuinely unimaginable.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.120]   He sent it, went back to work.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.200]   Then around lunchtime, he says things started happening.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.400]   And he talks about this huge pile on and people quote tweeting again and again, all of them
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:06.520]   pointing out problems with this tweet that he sent, such as I enjoyed that this tweet
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.080]   manages to be sexist on multiple levels.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.240]   Newsflash women cook and like Star Wars.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.240]   Imagine a woman.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.920]   Hi, have you met women?
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.860]   Women like Star Wars men cook.
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.280]   My husband is a huge Star Wars fan and is the cook in the house.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.280]   He bakes too.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.360]   Sorry to blow your mind.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.400]   And onward and onward and onward for a couple of days.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.440]   He pointed out like this is not like a major thing.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.760]   And here's how he describes it.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.720]   It was low effort clowning that felt charged only because it was traveling along such high
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.400]   energy vectors, sexism, homophobia, Star Wars fandom.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.600]   The platform can coax this exact sort of response out of its users with an incredibly small
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   amount of effort.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.200]   But only on the receiving end where all these messages collect in one place that it feels
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.640]   oppressive.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.080]   That's actually really good writing, by the way.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.560]   It was charged only because it was traveling along such high energy vectors, small amount
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.120]   of effort, but on the receiving end, they collect it feels oppressive.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.120]   I like that.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.120]   Very clear writing.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.160]   He says you could in this situation quit or turn off Twitter.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.400]   But he says in theory, you can just log on before the end.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.600]   But no one does that.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   All right.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.560]   So I think right up front, we get an interesting and I think incredibly apt description of
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.560]   what is this pile on dynamic that dominates Twitter at the moment.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.960]   It's this notion of things get put out there and then they can very quickly, people can
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.600]   take turns and test things out and see if they can gather attention with who can clown
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.760]   or dunk on the person even better.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.200]   And they have a certain energy to them because they often in order to gain attention for
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   my dunk to perhaps gain the applause of others, if you can connect it to what he calls a high
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.400]   charge vector that that is successful.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.960]   But for me sending that out, I'm just saying, like, let me try something here.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.440]   This guy talking about Star Wars, let me try something here connected to this or that.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.960]   Maybe I'll get some applause.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   Very little effort.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.800]   But for the person receiving in, it all adds up.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.600]   And disproportionately, it feels like your whole world is coming, collapsing in on you.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.960]   So I thought that was a really apt decision of what it's like to be on Twitter right now.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.480]   So he's like, that's what's that's what's that's what Twitter, you know, this is sort
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.800]   of what Twitter's been like recently.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.920]   And then he says, then we get the Musk's takeover of the platform.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:25.400]   And he says, this has strained the sense of conviviality that made conviviality that made
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.120]   Twitter feel like a party in the first place.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.040]   The site feels a little emptier, though certainly not dead.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.440]   Most like the part more like the part of the dinner party where only the serious drinkers
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.440]   remain.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.660]   Whiskey is being poured into the wine glasses.
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.020]   He steps back and has the final in this section with reflection.
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:44.160]   What exactly how we've been doing here for the last decade and a half.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.160]   All right.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.160]   So that's the setup to this piece.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.640]   He's about now to go into the evolution of Twitter, how it got to this place.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.400]   But I think this is a very accurate sense of the last year.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.880]   Twitter had become this place where this is one of the primary interactions happening
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:04.160]   is a sort of often mild, sometimes intense pile on type of dynamic of quote tweeting
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.640]   and trying to dunk on each other, typically trying to dunk on your ideological enemies
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.360]   or dunking on someone in such a way that signals.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:17.440]   You're the approval might solicit the approval of your your crowd or signal that you're a
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.960]   dunking on a representative of the enemy crowd.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.360]   And as Musk took over and journalists who don't like Musk have been leaving Twitter,
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.800]   then it's been having this sort of empty sense of like it's still going on.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.600]   But some of the marquee names that really put an energy into what's going on because
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.640]   these big name reporters and personalities are on here as they sort of leave.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.280]   It's not many people, but it creates an outsized effect.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.280]   I think all that is true.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.800]   I think that's a really good description of what Twitter feels like.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.640]   I think it really is true right now that even just a small amount of sort of these mainstream
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.100]   news organizations and reporters and personalities moving away from Twitter does give it that
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.400]   into the dinner party feel.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   You're still there.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.120]   You're still pouring your drink, but the table's not as full.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.480]   It changes the mood a little bit.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.480]   All right.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.760]   Staley then goes on to give a history, which I'm going to very briefly just hit on some
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.520]   highlights.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.120]   So he talks about how it got started.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:15.640]   Jack Dorsey wanted to call it status or statuses.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:21.140]   And Dorsey was really keen on this idea that the point of Twitter is to report what your
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.840]   status is.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.100]   I am doing this.
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.600]   I feel like this.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   Right.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.240]   That was the original idea of Twitter.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.000]   He got into an ideological battle with Evan Williams when he got involved with the company
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.560]   as well, where Williams thought this should be people should be tweeting about stuff that's
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.680]   happening.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:42.400]   And Dorsey said, no, it should be tweeting about me, what's happening to me.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.400]   And so the famous example was if there's a fire over at some address is the tweet.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.960]   I am seeing a fire at this address or is the tweet.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.160]   There is a fire at this address.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.920]   According to Staley, Williams was a big fan of the opposite of the latter.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.720]   And Dorsey was a big fan of the former.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.760]   Williams won that out.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:07.680]   And the prompt changed from how are you feeling or whatever to what's happening.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.680]   And a big turning point there was actually the miracle on the Hudson.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.600]   There's someone, you know, the tweets around that news event, solely Solenberger landing
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:22.880]   that Airbus A380 on or A330 probably landing that on the Hudson and how the tweets were
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.080]   more informative than the formal news was sort of this turning point of wait a second.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.840]   This can be a place to actually discuss what's happening, not just what's happening to you.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.120]   So that was a big change.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.320]   The next big bullet point comes in 2009.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.760]   Here's a key quote.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.160]   Twitter's takeover of the media class was rapid.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:45.960]   In April 2009, Marine Downe interviewed Williams and Stone, telling them that she would rather
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.500]   be tied up to stakes in the Kalahari Desert, have honey poured over me and red ants eat
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.400]   out my eyes that open a Twitter account.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.880]   She signed up three months later to promote her column.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.800]   Another good sentence.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.520]   And then it became, and I'm quoting Staley here, absolutely irresistible to journalists.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.240]   So this is another big turning point.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.960]   People were starting to use Twitter to talk about things that were happening and ideas
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.080]   that were interesting, not just what they felt like or what was happening to them.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.820]   It was no longer the Facebook status.
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:22.020]   It was a micro blogging type platform.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.240]   This became very appealing to journalists.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.440]   And now you get all the journalists on there because information and articles are being
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:32.120]   passed along and they want to know what is happening.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.320]   There was around this time, and I'm quoting here, an enormous expansion in web media with
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.520]   Buzzfeed, Vice and others pouring truckloads of venture capital into the field.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.400]   And though Twitter never drove much traffic, it was nevertheless important for journalists
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.760]   to be there because everyone else was there.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.160]   This was where your articles would be read and digested by your peers and betters.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.060]   It was doubly important because of how precarious these new jobs were.
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.340]   Your Twitter profile was your calling card, potentially a life raft to a new job.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.760]   The platform was an extremely fraught sort of LinkedIn, one you would use publicly to
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.940]   waste company time.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:10.660]   So that's the next phase of Twitter is we have all the journalists get on there.
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.880]   They want to know what's going on.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.320]   They want to promote their own articles.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.420]   They want to be a part of the conversation.
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:20.600]   They wanted to build up some sort of new media credibility that they could use if their venture
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:27.180]   backed web based mobile news startup failed, that they could point towards I've got these
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:33.380]   followers and make it easier for them to land at a new publication.
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.480]   Once all the journalists were on there, this again changed the character of Twitter.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.220]   So here's here's a staley.
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.420]   But this journalistic swarming instinct made Twitter an ideal place for activists to get
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.420]   a message out.
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:51.500]   So once we figured out what the journalists are on here and they're getting story ideas
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.780]   from here and they're quoting tweets in their articles and they're using since they're on
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.440]   here trying to promote their things and what other people are writing, trying to see what
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.860]   news is going on, they might want to write about.
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:09.100]   It is as if there was a single bar in Manhattan where all of the top editors of the main newspapers
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.100]   50 years ago were all gathering to drink every night.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:17.300]   If that happened, then if you wanted to spread some news, you would go hang out at that bar.
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.700]   Twitter became that bar.
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.460]   And this is where we began to get more of this activist energy.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.580]   And I'm using activists in the general sense here.
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.900]   Anyone who had some sort of message to spread.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.900]   And a lot of this was beneficial.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.740]   A lot of this was actually grassroots message spreading, but also anyone who had an axe
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.500]   to grind or an ideology ideology that they were obsessed about.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:42.260]   So then it became a place to try to influence the public sphere.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260]   It was still useful for people to be on here.
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.260]   Here's a quote.
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.700]   If you're good at this game, it could be good for you both on Twitter and off.
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.700]   People got commissions and book deals.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.260]   Not many, but enough.
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.720]   Some people lost their jobs.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.920]   Not many, but enough.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.820]   A couple of people got TV shows out of it.
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.540]   Once someone told the story so wild, it was turned to a feature film.
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:05.300]   Hell, one guy even went and got himself elected president.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:11.300]   But after a while, this focus and obviously Trump probably pushed us the last bit of the
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.740]   way towards this new configuration.
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:22.020]   But this focus is what in the last four or five years turned Twitter into the Coliseum,
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:26.700]   the way I've been describing it in most of my recent talks about this.
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.700]   Now that all the journalists were on there, now this is where the agenda was being set.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:38.500]   Now this is where ideas were being tested and the feedback could sway how companies
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.620]   operated and how things were reported.
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:47.380]   This importance that was concentrated into this one homogenized social internet tool
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.900]   inevitably turned it into a Coliseum.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.220]   And it became a battleground.
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:59.140]   You're either one of the 1% of users responsible for 75% of the tweets waging war on here.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:07.460]   The ultimate ideological, and I mean that not just politically, gladiatorial battlefield.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.560]   And you had to take down and dunk on your enemies.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:17.900]   And you also had to be very careful about curtailing your near allies to make sure that
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:22.540]   the proverbial or conceptual Overton window did not shift even a little bit.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.820]   So if someone shifted a little bit on the Overton window, you had to get everyone on
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.180]   that person fast because a little shift is how Overton windows make big moves over time.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.940]   It wasn't the guy saying the crazy thing.
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.420]   It was the professor who's more or less aligned with you that's like, "Hey, maybe you have
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.420]   some questions about this."
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.420]   No, no, no, no.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.820]   We got to get on that because this is where sense is being made.
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.500]   And William Staley, editor from the New York Times Magazine is on here and he's going to
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.420]   see that and it's going to affect what they say or don't say in the magazine.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.660]   And all this was happening from all sides on all sorts of issues, political, nonpolitical,
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.540]   sports, entertainment, whatever it was.
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.540]   Then it became the Coliseum.
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:59.260]   And for the last three to four years, the primary, I think, addictive quality of Twitter
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:03.000]   for the average user, which is not one of these reporters, not one of these partisans,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.300]   but a non-posting observer is that it's fun to watch important people hit each other with
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:17.700]   sticks and to say, "Ooh, this guy ducked under it, spun around and escaped.
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.980]   This guy got nailed in the head and then everyone else swarmed on him.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.160]   He never got up.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:29.700]   This guy was like the final battle against Magwa at the end of Last of the Mohicans where
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:36.500]   he swung his hatchet and the older, wiser man with his sword somersaulted under the
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:41.680]   hatchet, spun backhand sword to the back, right through the spine."
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.100]   You got to watch the final scenes of Last of the Mohicans if you don't know what I'm
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.700]   talking about, Michael Mann.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.080]   All right.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.040]   We're talking DDL, Daniel Day-Lewis, must watch.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.380]   You can find it online.
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.380]   And then that's what it became.
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.560]   And that was inevitable.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.860]   And then Musk took over.
[00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:02.680]   And when Musk took over, the journalist, especially for the mainstream leftist center or left-leaning
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:08.020]   journalist said, "This party, we're at this nice dinner party and it was getting kind
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.020]   of raucous."
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.360]   And then the host said, "By the way, I sold my apartment to someone you don't like and
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.220]   now it's his dinner party.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.060]   And so they're like, we're going to kind of leave."
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.840]   And that's where we are now.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.860]   And we find this question, what was Twitter anyway, being the headline.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:28.760]   And my response to all of this, beyond just saying this is a well-written and very perceptive
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.540]   article and I really enjoyed it, the link is in the show notes and I recommend it.
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:41.220]   My response to all of this is, and I say this with all modesty, I told you so.
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:47.460]   I've been saying this for years as one of the few people who is orbiting this world
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.740]   but has never been an active Twitter user.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:58.140]   I'm telling you from the outside, this metaphorical dinner party got weird a long time ago.
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:04.000]   This metaphorical dinner party became less an Algonquin round table and more shades of
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.340]   eyes wide shut.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.700]   It's weird.
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.260]   The rich guys are putting on masks.
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.460]   I don't know what's happening here, but it's weird that you're defending this so strong.
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:18.020]   I mean, it's not the worst thing in the world, but why is everyone using this?
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.660]   Why are so many editors and journalists and academics saying, "Of course I have to be
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.660]   on here."
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.020]   I was like, "No, you don't.
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.700]   This is weird."
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.180]   It's entertaining, but this is weird.
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.460]   This should be much more niche than it is.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:36.660]   And I used to say, and I stand by it, Twitter should have been like Game of Thrones, something
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.960]   that a non-trivial group of people were very into, but most people could care less.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.780]   And it somehow fought above its weight class.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.100]   So again, this is yet another example that I've, from news reporting I've been talking
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:54.380]   about in recent weeks, where I'm glad to see this sort of retrospective distancing from
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.380]   this platform.
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.180]   I don't think it's evil and I don't think you're bad if you use it.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.620]   I just do not think it should be ubiquitous.
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:05.460]   I do not think it should be necessary, a precondition to be part of the conversation.
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:10.720]   I was so happy to see the Washington Post move their nationals coverage off of live
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.440]   tweets and into really nicely designed websites.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.520]   I was happy a couple of weeks ago when I talked about, for whatever reason they did it, NPR
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.280]   saying, "We're not tweeting news.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.520]   Come back to NPR."
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.520]   I think this is all healthier.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:28.800]   I think we're going to see more and more retrospectives like William or Willie Staley's, where people
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:34.560]   look back and say, "Not my proudest moment, what I was doing on there."
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.820]   Not as essential as I was telling everyone that it was.
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.160]   I think the haze is lifting.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:50.680]   I think the fog is dissipating and we're going to gain back, hopefully, a more diverse, grounded
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.800]   public discourse.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.800]   So let's knock on wood.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   But that was a great article.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.960]   It was a good history.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.560]   I think seeing Twitter's evolution in those phases, that was interesting.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.200]   It's not something I'd seen before laid out so clearly.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:07.560]   So check that out and hopefully join me in my cautious optimism that Twitter's not going
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.640]   away, but it's no longer being mistaken for the town square.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.760]   We now see that it's devolved into a coliseum.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.560]   I want to see the demolition derby sometimes, but I don't want the demolition derby to be
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.480]   at the core of how the discourse unfolds.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.040]   All right, enough Twitter stuff.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.200]   I want to get to some questions.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:29.760]   First let me talk about our good friends at Henson Shaving.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:37.880]   So Henson makes this very nice razor, precision milled in high quality aluminum.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:44.160]   Henson has all these precision CNC routing machines because they, as their primary business,
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.360]   make high precision parts for the aerospace industry.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:51.440]   So they have the ability to mill metal to really precise dimensions.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.700]   And so this very nice metal razor they made leverages that ability.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.400]   And at its core is the idea that you can put a standard 10 cent safety blade in it and
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:05.520]   only .0013 inches of the blade will extend past the metal casing.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.920]   This allows you to get a close shave without the up and down diving board effect that causes
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.960]   nicks, that causes less close shaves, that causes clogs.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:19.320]   So they can use their precision to build a really nice razor that gives a really nice
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.320]   shave.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.280]   So not only is it a beautifully milled piece of equipment, I really enjoy this.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.100]   They actually sent me an aluminum stand recently to put it in.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:31.380]   So my razor, this nice aluminum razor and this nice aluminum stand, it looks very nice.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.180]   The economics makes sense.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.980]   Yes, you pay more for the razor because it's this beautiful milled piece of metal, but
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.660]   then you have it and you have it for good.
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:43.420]   And the blades you put in there are just 10 cent safety razors.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.840]   So it doesn't take long, right?
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.500]   It doesn't take long before you've made back the money you've spent on the expensive razor
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:55.780]   before you're coming out ahead of using the disposables or using the subscription services,
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.820]   because once you have it, it costs nothing to run.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.940]   Ten cents a week to run because you can just use a standard blade.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.760]   It's great technology, great product.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:09.720]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.220]   Visit hinsonshaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you and use code CAL and you'll get two
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.520]   years worth of blades free with your razor.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.580]   Just make sure to add them to your cart.
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:29.100]   That's 100 free blades when you head to hinsonshaving.com/cal and use that code CAL.
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:33.180]   I also want to talk briefly about our friends at Huel.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.180]   H-U-E-L.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:41.620]   I want to talk about their Huel Black Edition, a high protein, nutritionally complete meal
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.340]   in a convenient shake.
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:48.340]   That means it has everything your body needs in two scoops, including 27 essential vitamins
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:52.580]   and minerals and 40 grams of protein.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:57.740]   So since each scoop has 200 calories, you do two scoops and you're replacing essentially
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.120]   an average meal.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.340]   You're doing it easily and getting all of that good stuff.
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:09.500]   A couple benefits of Huel Black Edition, vegan, gluten-free, lactose-free, no artificial sweeteners,
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:15.580]   naturally flavored, low GI, omega-3, omega-6, GMO-free, palm oil-free, contains vegan vitamin
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.260]   D2 and V3 available in nine flavors.
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:22.860]   It works out to only about $2.50 per 400 calorie meal.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:29.760]   The way I like to use Huel is my fitness health philosophy is breakfast, lunch, automate.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.140]   Something that you know is healthy, that's not going to set you back on any goals you
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.980]   have in your health and is easy, and then put all of your attention into enjoying food
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.420]   and experimenting and cooking.
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.180]   Do that all at dinner.
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:45.340]   So Huel allows me when I'm in, don't want to think at all about food, I get you some
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:51.020]   breakfast before I go to class, I've been writing, scoop, scoop, shake, boom, 400 calories,
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:54.060]   barely cost me anything, all these other vitamins, other nice things in it.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.580]   That's how I use it, but you can use it however you want.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.060]   All right, so here's the good news.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:04.100]   You'll get a free t-shirt and a shaker for shaking up the shake with your first order
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.540]   by going to Huel.com/questions.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.540]   That's H-U-E-L.com/questions.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:15.300]   All right, let's do some, speaking of questions, let's do some questions with no preparation.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.260]   I'm sure this will go well.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.580]   I'm loading up my laptop here.
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:25.220]   All right, I got my spreadsheet.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.660]   I am not going to overthink this.
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:29.660]   Let's just jump in.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:34.780]   All right, question number one, haven't even read this yet, from Chandler, 44 years old
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.620]   from North Carolina, an executive director.
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.820]   All right, here's a question.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.940]   I don't disagree with your critique of follow your passion.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:44.940]   Thank you.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.940]   Good question, Chandler.
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:46.940]   Let's move on.
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:47.940]   No, I'm joking.
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:48.940]   He goes on.
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:53.740]   I don't disagree with your critique of follow your passion, but I wonder what you'd say
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:58.740]   to people considering or working in jobs where passion or a sense of calling to the profession
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:04.540]   is important, like nonprofits or mission-driven professions.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:08.900]   I run a faith-based summer camp and retreat center and work with many pastors, and I know
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:13.520]   how important a sense of calling is to make it through many of the difficult parts of
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.520]   these jobs.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.620]   It's a good question, Chandler.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.860]   Calling is different than passion.
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:26.580]   I know that sounds like it's a semantic game, but there is actually a substantial difference
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.740]   there that's important.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.420]   Calling comes out of the religious context.
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:38.060]   In particular, calling is used in the Judeo-Christian context for being called into the pastor or
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.780]   to be a priest and called into the clergy.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:47.820]   But traditionally, from a religious perspective, to be called into doing, let's say, to be
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:52.700]   a clergyman or something like this is a very different experience than the modern notion
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.580]   of following your passion.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:59.220]   Following your passion says this thing is really interesting and exciting to you.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.780]   So by matching that thing to your work, you will have all these positive attributes in
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:03.780]   your job.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.500]   You'll be interested and excited in your work, and that will be beneficial.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.100]   Callings can be burdens in the religious context.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.940]   Callings can be hardship.
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.100]   Read the lives of the saints.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.620]   They're not high-fiving everybody.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:21.140]   It's often felt as, "Okay, I feel as if God wants me to do this."
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:25.340]   They get great meaning out of it, but it's not enjoyable.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:32.540]   You're called to be a Coptic ascetic living in the desert in the year 300.
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.780]   You weren't high-fiving everyone every day.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:41.660]   You weren't like, "Man, I'm going to Instagram out a motivation porn picture of every day
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:46.340]   you can crush it by living in the sand and never bathing."
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.340]   So there's a difference.
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:52.180]   In other words, what I'm trying to say is it's a very important potential component
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.360]   to building a deep and meaningful career that you feel that there is something very important
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.020]   about what you're doing.
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:03.180]   This is, "I am bringing myself to a challenge, and I'm acting useful in the challenge."
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.020]   We know this from self-determination theory.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.060]   The sense of impact on other people or improvement of the world can be very motivating.
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:13.740]   I think all of that, if it's present in one of your job options, can be very powerful.
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.500]   You just don't want to expect that it's going to make every day exciting.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.380]   You just don't want to expect that it means you'll be whistling on the way to work each
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.380]   day.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.380]   Callings can be difficult.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.460]   My critique of follow your passion is twofold.
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.760]   One, this notion that you shouldn't rely on the fact that you have a clear preexisting
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.380]   passion to follow.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.580]   That's true for callings too.
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:32.580]   Most people don't.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.260]   It's not a big deal if you don't have that.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.020]   My second critique doesn't apply to callings.
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:40.940]   That's this idea that you're mistaken to believe that matching the content of your job to a
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.460]   preexisting interest will mean you have a sense of excitement and interest for your
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.460]   work every day.
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.460]   That's just not the way it works.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.680]   Fulfillment in work is more complicated and multifaceted.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:56.740]   A sense of social contribution, a sense of theological call, this type of stuff can be
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:01.260]   an important part of meaning, but it's a different thing than the follow your passion advice
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.260]   typically advises.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.620]   I'll give you one more very extreme example.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:09.740]   You have a relative, a family member, who's very sick.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:15.500]   You can get great meaning out of "I am taking care of this person," but it also sucks.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.060]   It's not what follow your passion proponents would say, "Follow your passion, you'll never
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.060]   work a day in your life."
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:23.100]   No, it sucks, but where does the meaning come from?
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:27.740]   This is important, and I feel that this is important, and I'm willing to get through
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.660]   the hardship because it's important.
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.940]   It's like raising kids.
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:31.940]   It's a calling.
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:37.580]   A lot of times it ain't so great, but deep down it's very good.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:42.220]   I don't know if that makes sense, Chandler, but I think of calling as different than passion.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.140]   Good on you, in other words, for what you're doing.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:50.060]   I'm glad you're using calling as part of a sense of depth and meaning in your life, and
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:54.620]   hopefully you're comfortable with that, even if not every day is exciting.
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.660]   All right.
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:02.140]   Let's just do ... Let's see what we got here.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.140]   That's not a real question.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:07.020]   All I'm skimming here is to make sure that it's an actual question.
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.820]   I'm otherwise not trying to edit this.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.820]   All right.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:10.820]   Let's see here.
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:11.820]   Hi.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.860]   Oh, let me give the name.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:17.540]   Mary, 40-year-old from New York City.
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.540]   Hi.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:24.020]   I work in leadership development in a large ... Oops, I lost it.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.780]   Large healthcare institution.
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:30.580]   I think your ideas on work processes, minimizing the footprint of a given workflow, are potentially
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:34.140]   game-changing for many of the leaders I work with, but I am struggling with how to share
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:38.820]   it with them and/or how to support them in hacking or improving workflows they are responsible
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.820]   for.
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.620]   In the places where I've heard you write or talk about this as reference with one or two
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:48.820]   examples, where can I learn more about how and not just why reimagining a workflow for
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.580]   efficiency and deep work?
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:33:00.020]   Well, Mary, if only someone had written a book that explains the whole history of how
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.660]   we got to our current structure of knowledge work and the principles.
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.660]   Yes, it would be great if there was principles.
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.940]   I don't know, maybe four, if I had to choose a number.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:16.460]   Four principles for how you could then go about reimagining work, just to pick a word
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:22.260]   out of many, reimagining work to be free of the structure of constant distractions.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.900]   What would those principles be?
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.160]   What are the strategies for successfully implementing those principles?
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.780]   What are examples of people and companies and organizations doing this?
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:36.220]   If only someone wrote that book and it was called A World Without Email and it came out
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:39.060]   in March of 2021, if only that existed.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:45.740]   All right, obviously I'm being facetious, but I really would say, Mary, read that book.
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:50.940]   I really do try to get into a strong case for what is wrong with how we work and the
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:54.620]   four principles for how we'd want to rebuild it with lots of examples and thoughts.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.220]   The issue is, and I think this is part of the problem with this whole potential movement
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:04.620]   that I was trying to spark with that book, it's not easily summarizable on an index card.
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.780]   And when you do try to summarize on an index card, people insert their own understanding
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.300]   of what you're trying to say, which is wrong.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:17.180]   They're like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, turn off your notifications on your email and send
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:19.700]   an email if the meeting doesn't need to exist.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:24.380]   And we need to reset our norms so that you don't expect a response to your email too
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.380]   soon."
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:29.420]   Everyone just has these hacks about their own interaction with emails.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.980]   They think this is the key.
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.140]   And the book is trying to get at something much more fundamental, completely reinventing
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:39.700]   these processes around avoiding the productivity poison that is constant context shift.
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:44.740]   This means you have to put in place collaboration and information spreading processes that minimize
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.620]   the number of unscheduled messages that must be seen and replied to.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.460]   None of that fits well on an index card.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:50.620]   It really does take some depth.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.460]   So that book is a good place to start.
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:57.220]   My interview about A World Without Email from March of 2021 with Ezra Klein, I think that
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:00.320]   was a pretty good, we got pretty in the weeds in the book.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:04.180]   So if you want to listen or read the transcript instead of reading the whole book, I think
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.860]   that can do pretty well as well.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:11.580]   And that book is doing pretty well, but not, it didn't jump out the gates like digital
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:12.740]   minimalism did.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:16.220]   And I think part of it is timing.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.300]   There's a pandemic and there's so much bad going on.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.460]   And people's work lives were not great, but there was so many reasons why it was not great
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:30.100]   that they weren't in the mood to overhaul collaboration systems.
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:34.860]   If you live in a blue state, you still probably had your kids at home doing Zoom while you
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.820]   were working.
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:40.020]   Those who are watching will see my giant scare quotes.
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:45.980]   And the last thing you had time to worry about is let's revamp how we spread the information
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.220]   to minimize message shifts.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.380]   I think there was a timing issue in the pandemic itself.
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.700]   So I'm trying to re-spread the word about it now.
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:57.260]   Also the book was, I think it was received as a little more organization focused and
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.020]   individual focused.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.740]   I think books do better for obvious reasons.
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.620]   If any reader who picks it up feels like they can change their life right away.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.820]   Now, the reality is a world without email is very individual focused.
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:11.660]   I get into great detail about these ideas you can put into place right now, even if
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:17.180]   your boss doesn't know it, but it feels like it is something that is more organizational
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.180]   focused.
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.780]   So, you know, that might've suppressed it as well.
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.100]   I mean, not that this book hasn't been selling copies, it has, but my standards are high.
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.100]   All right, let's roll.
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.100]   Let me try to go faster here.
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.940]   I'm just scrolling here randomly.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.260]   Here's Steve, 38 year old from New Jersey.
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.100]   I hope this is not too personal.
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:42.060]   Ooh, there's an interesting, a trepidatious, I proceed with trepidation after the start
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.060]   to the question.
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.080]   I hope this is not too personal.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.240]   How does watching movies fit with Cal's deep life?
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:56.000]   It seems that movies have many of the same problems that shallow life tech platforms
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   in the world today.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.740]   And in general, movies seem to open your mind up to values that may not be consistent with
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.740]   your deep life principles.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.900]   I don't agree with this, Steve.
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:13.720]   As a aspiring cinephile, there is incredible craft and art and legacy and cultural impact
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.460]   and artistic brilliance embedded into this medium.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:22.140]   So if you really appreciate movies, it's like appreciating music or appreciating art.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:30.540]   I would not compare that to a tweet dunkathon on Twitter or a high view, you know, Mr. Beast
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:36.940]   video on high view, Mr. Beast video on, you know, YouTube.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.940]   I mean, let's just even things you think, uh, what's the point?
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:40.940]   This is not great.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.900]   There's greatness often embedded in movies that people don't even see.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:48.700]   I was just re listening to recently Quentin Tarantino joined Bill Simmons's rewatchables
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:52.660]   podcast to talk about what he thinks is one of his best 10 movies of the last decade,
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:38:01.340]   which was Tony Scott's unstoppable Denzel Washington 777 train out of control.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:07.020]   Watch this movie and the, the artifice that goes into this, the constantly moving camera,
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.660]   the as a Simmons calls it downhill movement that starts five minutes in and doesn't stop
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:16.220]   till the end, the propulsive energy of the film, what's happening with the color palette
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.220]   and the rust.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:21.660]   I mean, it's a, a brilliant guy who spent two years putting all of his energy into constructing
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:26.900]   this thing that works and hits you at an interesting level and works with your mind and calves
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:27.900]   your intention.
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:28.900]   I don't know.
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.900]   It's a beautiful art form.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:30.900]   I love movies.
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:31.900]   I reject your premise.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.460]   I don't have a lot of time to watch them.
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.820]   It takes me days to finish a movie.
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:42.540]   Like often, especially if I'm busy, if we alternate bedtimes, often if I'm not doing
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.300]   bedtime, I can get 45 minutes in.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:48.140]   So maybe in one week I can get a movie done when I'm not as busy.
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:53.820]   I like to put in like twice a month, a movie watching lunch where I go and get a sandwich
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.660]   and watch a movie midday when I'm at home.
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:57.980]   I do enjoy doing that.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:58.980]   I just saw air.
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.540]   Julie and I went and saw air in the theater.
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:02.540]   I've got thoughts.
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.540]   I'm going to say six out of 10 right now, but I do see a lot of movies.
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:07.540]   I really like movies.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.540]   So you're not, you have no, you have little chance of getting me to agree that movies
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.180]   are shallow and we shouldn't spend time watching them.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.460]   All right, let's go here.
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.460]   I'm just rolling.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.260]   Alex, no information.
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.420]   I really like the idea of fixed schedule productivity.
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.460]   However, my schedule really fluctuates between weeks, which makes it difficult for me to
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.440]   implement a fixed in time for my work.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.900]   Some weeks are lighter while some weeks are more stressful and I have to push in the evenings
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.900]   and weekends.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.700]   Additionally, I want to have some weeks where I work longer and some weeks where I work
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.500]   shorter days because there are some weeks where my family needs more of my time than
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.660]   others.
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.540]   This makes a fixed deadline, which is same every day, very difficult to implement.
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.540]   All right.
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:48.100]   That's an interesting case, Alex, you're asking.
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.540]   And I, you know, by the way, I just realized I haven't been marking these questions as
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.540]   red.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:55.700]   If I don't mark them as red, I don't know later that I've already done it.
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:56.900]   So now I've started marking them as red.
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.980]   So if you hear any of those first questions show up again in the later episode, it's my
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:01.980]   fault.
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.540]   Alex, I think this is a good idea.
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:07.220]   So fixed schedule productivity for those who don't remember is the idea that you fix your
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.300]   work schedule in advance.
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:11.060]   And I'm just talking about the raw hours you'll be working.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.060]   This is it.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:16.700]   I do work backwards from that goal to figure out how in the world do I make my work fit?
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:22.940]   It's a meta productivity strategy because to accommodate this one goal, you're going
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:28.180]   to have to innovate and implement many different concrete productivity systems and ideas and
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.740]   rules to finish it.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:32.380]   You're going to have to cut back on your workload.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.820]   You're going to have to use time block planning to be more efficient about your time.
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:38.620]   You're going to have to start moving things around farther and back and into the future.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.220]   You're going to have to start cutting out time wasting.
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.500]   I mean, it just changes.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:47.100]   It induces so many concrete changes, small changes in order for you to hit this big goal.
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.380]   Alex is saying, does it have to be the same fixed schedule every week?
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.380]   I say no.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.380]   I think it's interesting.
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.180]   You have A weeks and B weeks.
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:56.220]   And you kind of choose what week is this?
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.580]   It's an A week or a B week.
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.700]   There's a different schedule for each.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:40:59.700]   Whatever.
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:00.700]   This is the week I'm doing this week.
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.700]   This is the schedule.
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.700]   Make it work.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.700]   This week is different.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.700]   Make it work.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.700]   I think that's fine.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:06.700]   I think it's a good idea, Alex.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.700]   Good innovation.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:11.500]   Multi-scaled, multi-valued fixed schedule productivity.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:12.500]   MVSSP.
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.500]   I like it.
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.720]   Let's get on a t-shirt.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.920]   All right.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:21.500]   Jumping around here.
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:26.740]   How does this is Kevin, how does the philosophy like effective altruism fit into the VFLCCP
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.580]   model you discussed on episode 18?
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:33.540]   Kevin, bonus points for good acronyming.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:39.620]   That is value, VBFLCCP is what I'm used to.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.580]   Value based lifestyle centered career planning.
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:42.580]   So I don't know.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.700]   FL, value focused lifestyle career planning.
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.700]   I'll assume that's what you mean.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.220]   How does effective altruism fit into it?
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.640]   So I don't understand the direction of the question.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:57.980]   So it's the question, how would something an interest like an interest in effective
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.220]   altruism fit into this?
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:07.220]   Or specifically, are you asking what does effective altruism say about approaching lifestyle
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.220]   centered career planning?
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.220]   I think you mean the latter.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:15.820]   So you're asking what specifically does effective altruism.
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:18.780]   How does that, what does that specifically tell us about this lifestyle centered career
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:19.780]   planning?
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:28.860]   I mean, I assume a hardcore effective altruist would, I guess, orient their bucket design
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.220]   around maximal good.
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:39.180]   And so I guess what I'm trying to say here is if you're a big believer in effective altruism,
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.300]   that's important part of your life.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:45.300]   You could certainly influence your value centric lifestyle career planning that way.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.580]   I know certainly some of those practitioners really do.
[00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:54.580]   Every aspect of their life is geared towards this John Stuart Millian utilitarianism.
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:58.020]   And so, yeah, but I think why this is important is not that that's what everyone should do,
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.660]   but that there are different flavors to this.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:04.980]   So what are other flavors that could significantly influence how your lifestyle centered career
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.580]   planning is shaped?
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:11.980]   I think there are certainly theological flavors to VFLCCP.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.740]   So you can imagine someone coming at this from a strong faith based tradition, it's
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.460]   going to affect all of those buckets.
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:23.300]   It'll be oriented around revelation from, you know, the relevant scripture.
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:31.500]   I could imagine an artistic creativity type focus at all the buckets that some people
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.460]   just very strongly build their whole life around artistic.
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:40.380]   I could imagine a sort of justice themed, a justice flavored approach to VFLCCP.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:44.660]   The point being is, you know, you create these buckets and then you understand what in these
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.720]   different parts of my life, how am I craft those parts of my life?
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.720]   What matters?
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.780]   How have I crafted my life to emphasize that?
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.600]   How you answer that question is influenced by so many things that are internal to your
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:54.600]   experience and your values.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:58.980]   And those values can be super influenced or super dependent on very specific philosophies,
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.360]   be it altruism or your religion or justice.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.900]   So I think you can have different flavors there.
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:11.780]   I'm trying to remember the name of a particular effective altruist who William, one of the
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.020]   main guys at Oxford, there's the New Yorker profile of him.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.540]   All I know is William is involved.
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:18.540]   I don't know if that's his last name or his first name.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.860]   Pretty sure I've met him too.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:22.940]   All right, let's, uh, let's roll here.
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:28.460]   Victoria, what do you think about David Graeber's bullshit jobs theory in relation to your idea
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.540]   as work as a means to an end?
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:34.560]   Actually, it's Recline who convinced me to finally read that book.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.100]   People really like David Graeber's bullshit jobs book.
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:39.780]   I read it.
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.380]   I think I need to read it again.
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:48.500]   I don't think it hit me as strongly as it hit other people, because to me there was,
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:56.020]   there's a very British sort of British civil service, British sentiment to the book that
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:45:01.540]   mismatch to some degree with the much more sort of high integer entrepreneurial approach
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.660]   to work that we have here in the States.
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:08.220]   And so the, the, the gears weren't grinding clearly for me.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:12.160]   My memory of Graeber's book is he's talking about these bureaucracies would literally
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.020]   have fake jobs, right?
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.700]   It was like office space.
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.060]   You know, what would you say you do here?
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:23.060]   You're like, well, I give the memo from this person, that person.
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.780]   Oh, so you walk it over to the person.
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.340]   Well, no, I have someone else come do that for me.
[00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:30.580]   You know, like actual fake jobs where nothing happens and how soul deadening that is.
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:31.780]   And I'm sure it is.
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:33.740]   It's just the American experiences.
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.780]   That's not our problem as much.
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:36.780]   Yeah.
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:42.060]   Often, you know, our jobs are really, they're doing things like we were very energize.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:45.380]   We don't have this bureaucracy sense of nothing to do here matters.
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:46.460]   I'm just buying out the time.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.220]   It's like, I'm incredibly busy.
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:50.100]   I can't keep up with all I have to do.
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.300]   And I'm actually distressed because I'm letting people down that I'm not getting back to them.
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.960]   Their emails, there's almost like an opposite problem here.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.060]   It's like an overly energized job issue.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:05.580]   And I think the, the issue that a lot of people have here is not the job is ultimately meaningless,
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:09.740]   but the approach to the work itself is ultimately unsustainable.
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:13.740]   This hyperactive hive mind, let's constantly switch back and forth to asynchronous and
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:18.460]   ongoing conversations about all this different work coupled with this autonomy mindset of
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:21.660]   there's no centralized control or agreement on reasonable workloads.
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.820]   You can just get piled deeper and deeper and deeper until you get so stressed.
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.260]   You just call out uncle.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.260]   And that's what stops people from pushing more back onto your plate.
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:30.440]   It's incredibly stressful.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.740]   You feel like you're spending most of your time managing work instead of actually executing
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:34.740]   work.
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:35.740]   You're always behind.
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.980]   It's hitting all these triggers inside your brain, the way we're wired.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.820]   It makes us unusually miserable.
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:41.820]   This is the problem.
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:45.820]   I think the bigger problem here, especially in the States, it's not that our jobs mean
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:48.360]   nothing and we're boring ourselves to death.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:51.020]   This is not the pale King David Foster Wallace.
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:58.860]   It is that we're working in such an incoherent manner that meaning or not our jobs are slowly.
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:02.860]   And for some of us quickly, completely burning us out.
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:06.780]   So the first read that then it didn't click with me as strongly as people thought it might,
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.380]   but I should read that again.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.900]   All right, let's, let's do a couple other right now.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:17.340]   I'm just, I'm just looking for quick things.
[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:22.700]   All right, Raphael, I'm a teacher of young students from 15 to 19 years old.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.460]   I've noticed that the capacity to focus is increasing each year.
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.540]   Is there any possibility that the ability to focus could be irreversibly damaged?
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:29.540]   It's not great.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:34.140]   If you spend your adolescent and young adult years constantly on your phone, your brain
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.500]   is going to get very used to that.
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.380]   It's going to have a hard time not having that distraction.
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:45.060]   And it's not that this is preventing your brain from being able to focus entirely, but
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:49.620]   it's keeping you away from the type of training you need to build up that muscle and that's
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:53.980]   reading and being alone with your own thoughts and trying to integrate data and understand
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:58.100]   hard things and rewind that scene from Tony Scott's Unstoppable to understand what he
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:02.740]   was trying to do with that glass reflection shot and why that's poetically appropriate
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:03.740]   for the scene.
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:09.340]   When you don't do this type of work with your mind, you don't build up those cognitive muscles
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:13.460]   and this highly salient distraction keeps that away from you.
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:17.180]   And it also builds up this addiction to that type of information.
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.500]   So I think it's an issue.
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:23.740]   My big advice to young people is you don't have to outrun the bear.
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:27.020]   You just have to outrun the person you're with when the bear starts charging.
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:32.980]   And so if you are even a little bit treating your phone with wariness, treating your brain
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:40.340]   with respect, it's like the old proverb, the one eyed man is king in the world of blind
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.420]   people.
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.180]   You're going to have a huge competitive advantage.
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:46.220]   So that's the only silver lining here.
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:47.220]   All right, I'm running out of time here.
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.380]   Let me do one more.
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:50.380]   One more question.
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:54.460]   Nick, 35 year old programmer from Ireland.
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:57.140]   Let me mark this as red.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:02.540]   Hi, Cal, I'm curious on your thoughts on the crossover between parenting and professional
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:03.540]   improvement.
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:07.700]   Crossover, you don't mean direct negative correlation.
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.780]   I kid.
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:15.140]   I have a three year old daughter and a chronically ill wife with just one kid.
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.780]   We've been pushed to the breaking point at times, but managed to survive with lots of
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.860]   time off work to help at home.
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.940]   With my daughter recently starting school, I thought I could get back to a bit of my
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:23.940]   productive life.
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:29.180]   And it seems that it may have been a little ambitious with three kids.
[00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:34.260]   Did you purposely scale back things professionally, whether that was writing or research in order
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:40.180]   to be more available for family, ride more difficult waves at home to speak, sort of
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.980]   goes on and on like that.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.620]   Oh, wait, look at the final part.
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:46.620]   Do you have seasons that are unbalanced and you find a way sometimes to sacrifice important
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:47.620]   things in the short term?
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.860]   All right, it's a good question.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:53.540]   No, kids make it harder to do professional stuff.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:55.900]   It just makes it harder.
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.460]   And you have to rethink things.
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:03.780]   And I think for me, that difficulty is part of what went into the development of slow
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:10.620]   productivity as a philosophy, realizing that a philosophy of productivity that is based
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:17.900]   on the maximizing the rate of production or maximize what a lot of people don't even measure
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.980]   production, maximizing the hours spent producing.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:25.180]   This is actually the heuristic that most people fall back onto because it's too difficult
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:30.060]   or maybe too disillusioning to measure what did I actually produce and how much do people
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.060]   care.
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:34.780]   So they say, I'll adopt what I call in my new book pseudo productivity, and I will try
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:38.220]   to measure instead just activity with the idea that activity generates results.
[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:40.460]   So more activity will generate more results than less.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:44.060]   That conversion function between that time and results, I don't even want to know.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.120]   It's a monotonically increasing function.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.840]   So more is better.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:54.860]   That mindset of productivity does not mix well with kids because kids take away time.
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:59.180]   They take away energy and they take away sleep.
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:04.460]   And yes, I can imagine all the emails now and it hits everyone very differently.
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:06.980]   And some people have this much worse than other people.
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.660]   And some people's kids are incredibly well behaved and slip through the night.
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:12.860]   And other people's kids have real serious issues that take up a lot more time.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.900]   And there's the gender dynamics and there's the et cetera, et cetera.
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:19.260]   But it's also bad for everyone, just in all different ways.
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:20.260]   But it's bad for everyone.
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:21.260]   Let's put it that way.
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:24.540]   A wildfire sweeping through your town is bad for everyone.
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:29.900]   And we can agree on that even if some people's houses burn to completely down to a crisp
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:34.380]   and other people's houses, they only lose some trees.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:36.180]   The baseline here is it's bad for everyone.
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:43.100]   So if your definition of productivity is amount of work per day, or if you're a little bit
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:48.300]   more careful rate of production of things in the short term, kids can be psychically
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:50.860]   dislocated.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:56.940]   On the other hand, if you have a slow productivity mindset, what matters is production on the
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:57.940]   larger scale.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:00.620]   I mean, I want to keep, obviously keep the lights on and be responsible in the short
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:07.260]   term and I'm not going to just disappear or leave a business partner in the lurch.
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:12.100]   But I'm also no longer of the mindset that it's the 10 hours a day that's going to sort
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:17.340]   of that I'm 20 and I'm eager and ambitious and don't even know what to do.
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:22.140]   It's an inchoate energy that I'm just spraying wildly.
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:23.140]   That mindset doesn't work.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:30.400]   It's instead over the next few years, I want to produce a book I'm really proud of.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:35.620]   And yeah, I have these kids at home and this one kid is having hyperactivity issues or
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:38.380]   real bad allergies and we have to go through all these doctors.
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:42.580]   So I'm slowing the hell down on the rate of work in the near term.
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:43.580]   It's okay though.
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:44.580]   What's the impact?
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:49.060]   Like maybe it takes three years instead of two and a half or three years instead of two.
[00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:50.060]   I don't care.
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.180]   20 years from now, I'm just going to look back and say, hey, remember that period of
[00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:53.900]   life when you had young kids, you produced this cool book.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:53:00.500]   We don't notice those differences, those epsilons of 20, 30, 40% when we look back through time.
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:06.540]   We don't look at Newton and say, man, it took you a while to really work through all of
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:09.980]   the implications of the inverse square law and produce the Principia Mathematica.
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:12.460]   We just say Newton produced this great book.
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:16.940]   Most people don't know it took him 25 years to do and that he could have done it in five,
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:20.020]   but he had this whole detour where he was convinced he was going to solve alchemy and
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.500]   make gold out of lead and was kind of a weirdo.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:25.300]   I know it just, he produced the book and it was cool.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:30.700]   I could stop working today on any type of writing and 20 years from now, people would
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.100]   probably still say the same thing.
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:33.860]   Oh yeah, I read deep work.
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:34.900]   That was cool.
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:36.820]   We changed something at our office about it, you know?
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:44.660]   So slow productivity, which I think is a necessity if you have kids, slow productivity is much
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:46.080]   more comparable.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.420]   You give yourself permission to slow down.
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:51.520]   You give yourself like right now, I do not like that I accidentally fell into a really
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:54.500]   busy semester because I've become so used to slow productivity.
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.540]   I'm going to react hard to this.
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:59.020]   I'm going to slow down for a while.
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:01.960]   And that's a slow productivity mindset says, yes, great.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.500]   Don't do anything this summer.
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:04.500]   Recharge.
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:05.500]   Life is long.
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:06.500]   Days are short.
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:07.500]   You're okay.
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:12.940]   It's okay if this season is slow and this season is more.
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:14.940]   So I'm a believer in it.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:20.620]   And I don't want people to delude themselves that you can somehow avoid kids being an impact
[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:21.620]   professionally.
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.060]   And I don't want people to elude themselves that other people aren't feeling any impact
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:27.140]   and somehow it's unusual what's happening to them.
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:30.100]   I don't want people to feel that frustration or isolation.
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.440]   Everyone feels at the different degrees.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.740]   Everyone's life is messed up to some degree when the wildfire moves through.
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.460]   I hope my kids don't listen to this podcast.
[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:41.580]   I don't mean to describe them as a wildfire, a wildfire destroying people's houses.
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:46.220]   It's maybe not the right metaphor, but you get what I'm trying to say.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:51.940]   So anyways, Nick, I guess my off the cuff response here is life is long.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:52.940]   Days are short.
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:56.400]   All sorts of triumphs and tragedies will happen.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.100]   There's a lot of beauty in what's happening in your life right now.
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:02.580]   There's a lot of hardship in what's happening in your life right now and work.
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:04.000]   You know, you're doing what you can.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.780]   You're being responsible to your employer.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.660]   You're envisioning things you might do in the future.
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:09.860]   And that's a perfectly appropriate season.
[00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:13.420]   Just like there might be another season in your life where you're locked in and you're,
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:17.840]   you know, on a work project that's really important and maybe just things come together
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.340]   much more slowly for you.
[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:22.500]   I always think about, who am I thinking about?
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:27.900]   Hilary Mantel, Mandel, Mantel, Wolf Hall, historical novelist.
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:29.420]   She died recently, I believe.
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:35.760]   She was chronically ill and had a lot of issues health wise.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:38.440]   So she wrote those books slow.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:42.200]   And I really hope I'm not missing, mixing up Hilary Mantel with someone else.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:48.240]   I might be mixing her up with, well, does Laura Hildebrand also have a chronic illness?
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:53.080]   I may be incorrectly ascribing chronic illnesses to people who don't have them, but there is
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:54.080]   an author I have in mind.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.600]   I do think it was her.
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:00.360]   And I might, you know what, I'm looking it up.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.720]   All right.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:10.040]   There's no more compelling radio than hearing someone type into something.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.040]   I believe.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.920]   All right, let's see.
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:19.500]   I do think it was Hilary Mantel who did die last year.
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.360]   And I am scrolling.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:30.040]   Yeah, during her twenties, Mantel had a debilitating and painful illness.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:41.180]   And so she wasn't Stephen King in 1986, coked up to his eyeballs, writing 600 pages a week.
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:42.180]   She couldn't do that.
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:43.620]   But you know what?
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:47.240]   I had to look it up to say, was this the person I was thinking about who had that illness?
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:51.200]   Because what do I, like most people know about her, she won two Booker prizes and her books
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.200]   were fantastic.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:56.760]   So anyways, what I'm trying to say is a slow productivity mindset where the idea is do
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:00.940]   fewer things, work at a natural pace with ups and downs and all different timescales,
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:04.160]   but obsess over the quality of the things you do.
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.280]   Not how fast, but the quality.
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:11.220]   It can be the recipe for a very fulfilling professional life that is adjustable and adaptable
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.760]   to all sorts of different situations.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:18.720]   So anyways, this is all a long commercial for when my book comes out next year on slow
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.200]   productivity, you got to buy it.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.520]   I think you're going to like it.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:23.520]   All right.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.520]   Look, we're short on time here.
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:27.320]   I want to do a quick something interesting before we get there.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:33.540]   Let me mention a sponsor of ours, our friends at Rhone, R H O N E.
[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:39.640]   For years I actually, and continue to this day, wear Rhone workout style t-shirts as
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:42.040]   my main DC summer wear.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.040]   I think they look nice.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.480]   They wick the moisture.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.440]   They're a higher quality than like a cheaper t-shirt.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:50.880]   They feel really sturdy, which is why I was excited to find out about their new commuter
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.400]   collection.
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:57.800]   This is Rhone style clothes with their comfort, their breathability and flexibility, but in
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:01.960]   a more of a business casual style, something you could wear to the office.
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:05.360]   In my case, something I can teach in.
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.680]   While having clothes that's very light, very flexible, something I'm not going to overheat
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:09.680]   into.
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.540]   Rhone helps you get ready for any occasion with the commuter collection, which offers
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:17.560]   the world's most comfortable pants, dress shirts, forth zips and polos.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:21.840]   You never have to worry about what to wear when you have the Rhone commuter collection.
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.600]   Four way stretch fabric is breathable.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.880]   It's flexible, leaves you free to enjoy what life throws your way.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.480]   I think Jesse has mentioned he's worn some of this playing golf.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:31.080]   I like it teaching.
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.080]   I'm moving around.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.080]   I'm working up a head of steam.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:39.400]   I don't want some thick, stiff, starch shirt on that's going to completely overheat me.
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.120]   It looks good.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:46.660]   Sprinkle free technology, gold fusion, anti-odor technology, a hundred percent machine washable.
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:54.600]   It's just a good set of good looking clothes for men that you can use in active situations.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:57.840]   So the commuter collection can get you through any workday and straight into whatever comes
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:58.840]   next.
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:03.760]   Head to rhone.com/cal and use the promo code Cal to save 20% off your entire order.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.120]   That's 20% off your entire order.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:12.000]   When you head to rhone.com/cal and use that code Cal, it's time to find your corner office
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   comfort.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.760]   And there's a good tagline, corner office comfort.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:23.200]   I also want to mention our friends, a newish sponsor, Fields of Greens.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.520]   Field of Greens.
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:29.600]   I talked about earlier in the show how I like to automate my health before dinner.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.800]   I don't want to think about what I eat or what I drink.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:36.000]   I just want it to be healthy and energized so I don't waste any brain cells on it.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.820]   And then I can care about food and enjoy food when I get to dinner.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:46.480]   So one of the things, as long as I'm automating my food morning through afternoon, I want
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:49.200]   to make sure I'm getting, as long as I'm automating it, I want to make sure I get the stuff I
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.200]   need.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:55.160]   Now, doctors say that should include six cups of fruits and veggies a day, but probably
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:59.760]   not going to have time to sit there and actually eat six cups worth of vegetables.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.600]   This is where Field of Greens enters the pictures.
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:07.000]   It is a supplement that gets you that needed nutrition easily.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.760]   Unlike other fruit and vegetable supplements, each specific fruit and vegetable in Field
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:15.280]   of Greens was medically selected to support specific functions like heart health, liver
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.920]   and kidney health, immune system and metabolisms.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:23.120]   I take Field of Greens to help me stay healthy, make sure I'm getting what I need.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.120]   It works fast.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.120]   You'll feel healthier.

[01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:03.400]   All right, let's do something interesting to end the show.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.000]   So again, I would normally have this up on the screen, but I don't know how to do that
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   without Jesse.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.060]   I'm helpless without Jesse.
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.360]   So I'm just going to read it to you.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:14.000]   This is a productivity thing to have a little bit of a meta commentary on.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.960]   There's a link in the show notes.
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:22.880]   So there's a thread someone posted about a, there's a, someone out there called Rob Drydeck,
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.600]   who has launched 18 brands and exited six of those brands for over $550 million.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.180]   So this guy's out here, very successful businessman.
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:34.200]   Someone else did a Twitter thread about his productivity system.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.960]   I want to read a little bit about how this person is describing Rob Drydeck's productivity
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.880]   system because there's an observation I want to make.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:46.400]   All right, so here's the description that this Twitter commenter had on Drydeck's system.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:51.420]   He says, how does he do all this by tracking every hour of his life?
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:54.060]   Here's a breakdown of his system.
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:57.360]   Rob's goal is to be optimized towards life mastery.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.000]   He has an 80 page operating manual for his life managed by four people, and he has systems
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.200]   and automation in place that makes everything effortless.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.360]   What exactly does he do?
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:09.600]   Every day he gets up at 5am, brain trains, meditates, works out, maintains a clean diet,
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.180]   doesn't drink, take supplements.
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:14.640]   He calls these the core seven and realized that every time he completed the seven, he
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.640]   felt happier.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.800]   So that's his base now.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.300]   He tracks every hour of his day.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:23.000]   This year, I don't know if this is average or not, he spent seven hours sleeping, seven
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.280]   hours working, two hours on a physical body, seven hours with family and friends.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.280]   Perfectly balanced, he said.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.400]   But he tracks more than just time.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.640]   Every day he tracks on a zero to 10 scale how he feels about his life, work and health,
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.760]   how motivated he is, how well he slept, his full body composition, how his wife feels
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.760]   about his relationship.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.760]   Then he analyzes it.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.640]   If it's below five, you look at the world half empty.
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.920]   Anything above five, you're half full.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.040]   It doesn't matter what hits you.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.120]   You keep going.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.760]   By doing this, he becomes what he calls qualitatively aware, which helps him identify what brings
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.620]   him down and eliminate it.
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:52.320]   He designed his ideal life in 2015.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.600]   It was a 10 to 20 year plan.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.600]   He's already 75% there.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.600]   It's not hard.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.600]   It's not even discipline.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600]   It's just how he lives.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.400]   He gamified the process and automated as much as he can.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.520]   So everything is effortless.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:09.360]   I am pretty obsessed with optimization, but this is the craziest level I have ever seen.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:13.160]   Here's what caught me about this description.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.080]   The tone of it doesn't really match the reality.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:22.040]   Now, I didn't listen to the source interview on which all these observations was pulled
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.380]   out.
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:27.160]   But if you take away that tone and the way that this Twitter commenter is talking about
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:33.440]   Rob Drydeck's productivity system, what you actually see is something that is probably
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.200]   not the craziest, most obsessed optimized thing you've ever seen.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.160]   There's actually just some common sense here.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.440]   Let's break this down briefly.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:45.820]   So when he talks about having an 80 page operating manual managed by four people and systems
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:49.240]   and automation in place to make everything effortless, I am guessing that's a red herring.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:54.000]   I'm guessing that is referring to Rob Drydeck's business, that his business that handles these
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.320]   brands is systems oriented, which is smart.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:01.120]   And I'm assuming this 80 page operating manual for people and automation, I'm guessing, I
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.120]   could be wrong.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.120]   A lot of that is his business.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:07.560]   Let's put that aside and talk about his personal productivity.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:11.680]   When you look at this, nothing here, and maybe I'm immune, but nothing here hits me as that
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:12.680]   crazy.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.960]   He gets up early and meditates and exercises.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.320]   He doesn't drink, he eats healthily, he takes supplements.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.360]   That's like a very standard doctor recommended lifestyle.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:25.600]   Get some sleep, you should exercise, like don't put crap in your body.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.680]   So far, not the craziest system I've ever seen.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.160]   He tracks every hour of his day.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.660]   Well, you know, he time blocks plans.
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.800]   Seven hours sleeping, seven hours working, two hours physical body, seven hours with
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800]   friends.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:37.800]   So he like works a normal schedule.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.600]   I guess he tracks it.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.680]   That's not crazy.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.360]   Like how much did I sleep last night?
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.360]   How much did I work today?
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.640]   That's not a crazy thing.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:51.280]   Like if I was doing this now, I could go back and say, I feel overloaded recently.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.700]   How much am I really working?
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.040]   How much work makes you feel overloaded?
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.040]   It's sort of like a diary.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:59.280]   Again, I don't think that's that crazy.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:03.320]   And then he does this thing where he keeps metrics on how different parts of his life
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.320]   are going.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.600]   I mean, that might be a little bit more fiddly than most people would do.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.560]   But again, it's a nice bit of feedback.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.720]   Okay, this is getting out of whack.
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.160]   I need to make some changes.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.160]   And that's it.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.160]   Oh, and he has a life plan, but okay.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.640]   VBLCCP, you should have a life plan.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.640]   I'm okay with that.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:27.880]   So anyways, what I'm trying to say here is this mismatch is important because this mismatch
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:32.480]   in tone versus this actual system reveals two things.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:37.240]   One, you know, a lot of people who maybe are very successful like this Rob Drydeck, they're
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.960]   not actually implementing the craziest optimization scene you ever lived.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.240]   And they're also not working all the time.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.960]   They're actually it's pretty common sense.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:48.600]   There's just some discipline there, but try to keep work constrained to the workday.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.420]   Eat well and exercise.
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:53.960]   Maybe keep track in your diary of how things are going so that you have some record of
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:56.360]   things are out of whack and then figure out how to fix it.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.320]   Notice his system doesn't automatically fix it.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.960]   He's not trying to optimize these numbers.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.360]   He's just using these numbers as qualitative feedback.
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:05.400]   So he can say, you know what, I'm not seeing my friends a lot.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.840]   I'm putting a low number here.
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.280]   You know, I'm going to cut back on this or this is going to remind me to go reach out
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.280]   and talk to her friends.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.280]   I don't know.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.320]   It all seems pretty common sense.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:17.560]   So it tells us that not everyone who is in this sort of is very successful in an entrepreneurial
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:21.980]   sense is necessarily working all the time or using a crazy system.
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:29.120]   But the fact that this particular Twitter follower is in doing in booing in booing.
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:35.480]   Injecting this tone of crazy optimization, I think, also emphasizes how there's this
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:42.760]   whole subculture online that just like I was involved in in 2007 with the early productivity
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.200]   prong movement.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:49.760]   Holds out this idea that with the right systems and the right discipline following the systems,
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.500]   all these other good things will happen in your life.
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:54.560]   And so it shows there is the fury of this subculture.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:58.120]   Not only fury, I mean furious energy, the furious energy of this hustle subculture that's
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.360]   like systems and optimized.
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:04.400]   And if you get all the numbers just right, there'll be an epiphenomenon of this activity
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.680]   is going to be success and happiness.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.400]   And then you see the reality of like, actually, people are really doing that.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.400]   Well, this guy's not.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.160]   And I thought that mismatch was really telling.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.160]   So I don't know.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.160]   I'm just seeing that on the fly.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.520]   But I thought that was something interesting.
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:15.520]   All right.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.080]   Well, this is all the time we have for today.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.320]   So thank you for listening for this, Jesse, free episode.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:25.000]   Thank you for listening to me make my way through questions for which I had no preparation.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   Hopefully that went OK.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.160]   I'll be back next week with Jesse for a normal episode unless something unexpected happens.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:37.040]   So until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.400]   (upbeat music)
