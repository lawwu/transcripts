[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.380]   - Okay.
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.280]   I'm Karen D'Amato.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.400]   I came to my first Bogleheads meeting
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.040]   exactly 20 years ago this year.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.320]   What was then called Diehards 4 in Denver.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.520]   And I had the chance to come,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.760]   that one and a few others as a financial journalist
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.880]   at the Wall Street Journal and then at Money Magazine.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.760]   And since I've moved on in my career,
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.680]   I've had the honor to come as an individual Boglehead
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.780]   and now as a member of the Bogle Center Board,
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.240]   which has been wonderful.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.920]   And I work with an amazing group of people.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.720]   And I'm delighted to be up here moderating
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.560]   with our esteemed panel.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.040]   They are authors, financial advisors, educators.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.600]   Most of them have worn all those hats.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.880]   They're widely recognized and quoted in the press.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.380]   I encourage you to read all the details of their bios.
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.060]   Also, everyone here has already spoken
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.120]   or will be speaking at one or more sessions
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.280]   during the conference.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.040]   I want to include a particularly warm welcome
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.140]   to Carolyn McClanahan who is here
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.360]   for her first Bogleheads conference.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.520]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.360]   Carolyn is a physician turned financial planner.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.160]   She's the founder of Life Planning Partners,
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.680]   and she also dodged a very hazardous hurricane
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.820]   to join us here.
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:51.320]   So going from your left over Bill Bernstein,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   Paul Merriman, Carolyn, Alan Roth and Rick Ferry.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.140]   We're gonna cover a bunch of topics
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.480]   and I'm gonna work hard to leave 10 minutes
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.020]   at the end for questions.
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.320]   So please write questions on the cards.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.760]   People will be coming around to collect them.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.680]   Let's start off with the US stock market.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.560]   The last year has seen excellent performance
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.960]   when I looked at the Morningstar style box,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.760]   all sections of the style box are up at least 25%
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.560]   over the past 12 months.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.040]   But we've also seen that the market
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.920]   is extremely concentrated
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.080]   with the so-called magnificent seven stocks
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.840]   comprising over 30% of the S&P.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.360]   And I'm wondering your thoughts about
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.560]   should investors be concerned about that concentration
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.040]   because supposedly we're buying index funds
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.480]   for this wide diversification,
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.860]   but are they still delivering that?
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.440]   - I wrote a piece roughly a couple months ago
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.840]   on is the market too concentrated.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.600]   There are over 12,000 publicly traded companies
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.760]   between the total US and total international
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.820]   stock index fund.
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.600]   And the top 10 companies account for over 20%
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.580]   of the global market cap.
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.960]   So I researched what has happened in the past
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.160]   not that that could assure what's gonna happen
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.180]   in the future.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.480]   And when markets go up, markets get more concentrated.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.040]   And we are at record concentration now.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.200]   But it's not predictive of when the market
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.540]   is going to go down.
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.800]   So I'm not a believer in value investing,
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.040]   I'm a believer in market cap investing.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.820]   So, and I love Paul.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.800]   It is a problem, it concerns me,
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.000]   but I'm still going total market cap,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.560]   boring, low cost index funds.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.160]   So I don't have a solution, but I do have a concern.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.440]   - Well, speaking as someone who has
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.780]   a somewhat opposing point of view,
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.960]   someone who is tilted, although I have nothing wrong
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.000]   with the market cap approach,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.840]   I'm sleeping a whole lot better at night these days.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.560]   - I'm sorry, explain that Bill.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.280]   - Well, the fact that I'm tilted away
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.400]   from the magnificent seven stocks
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.880]   makes me a lot more relaxed about the concentration
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.760]   in the markets, since I'm not exposed to it.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.760]   I mean, a good day for me is a day when NVIDIA's down 5%.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.760]   - Bill, as you pointed out, I sleep well at night,
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.100]   not by counting sheep, but by counting my tips ladder.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.200]   - Oh, I'm sure we'll get to that.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.520]   So, you know, on a practical standpoint,
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.400]   we've always just invested in the total stock market index
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.840]   instead of the S&P 500 index,
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.040]   'cause that mitigates a lot of the risk
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.880]   of overconcentration, but if you look back at history,
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.640]   we go through periods of overconcentration in companies,
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.960]   and it just rotates.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.180]   So what was overconcentrated 20 years ago
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.600]   is not overconcentrated now, and through all that all,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.860]   the stock market has just continued to go up.
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.240]   So if you just stay fully diversified,
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.160]   I mean, widely diversified in total stock market,
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.240]   I think you're gonna be fine in the long term.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.440]   And again, the one part, though,
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.280]   is ideally you have a portfolio allocation
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.680]   that's dedicated to your ability
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.020]   to take risks financially and psychologically,
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.120]   so you have that fixed income set aside
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.660]   so that whatever happens,
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.700]   you're gonna sleep well all the time.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.200]   - I would agree that we've come to a fork in the road
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.360]   as investors where we are either going to be market timers
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.920]   or we're going to be buy-in holders,
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.780]   and we're either gonna build a portfolio
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.160]   based on what we see is gonna happen
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.180]   in the next five or 10 years,
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.480]   or we just accept what happens
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.600]   for the next five or 10 years,
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.740]   staying broadly diversified.
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.240]   And I happen to live 40 feet
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.260]   from this gentleman on my right.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.780]   He unfortunately lives above me.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.280]   That's 'cause he's smarter.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.080]   But the bottom line is that
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.200]   when you're massively diversified,
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.080]   it really doesn't matter,
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.120]   except none of us like the market to go down
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.540]   and be in it when it's happening.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.600]   But other than that, I don't even worry,
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.920]   I don't even look to see how the pieces
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.040]   of my portfolio have done this year.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.800]   It doesn't matter.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.560]   - Okay.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.120]   Go on, Rick.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.960]   Hi, Rick.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.600]   - Okay, if you're a global equity investor,
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.940]   only thing you need to worry about
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.320]   as far as your portfolio is money coming out of the market
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.880]   and money going into the market, okay?
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.560]   Once the money is in the market,
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.840]   whether it's in mega cap seven
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.720]   or it comes out of mega cap seven
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.080]   and goes more broadly to the mid caps
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.960]   or the small caps or maybe goes international,
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.120]   money is staying in the market,
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.960]   so your portfolio isn't gonna go down in value
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.840]   because it's like, okay, the fish moved
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.760]   from this part of the ocean to that part of the ocean,
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.000]   but you own the whole ocean.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.400]   So it doesn't matter that the fact
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.680]   is these magnificent seven.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.120]   As long as people are not pulling money out of stocks,
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.680]   then your portfolio will be fine
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.480]   'cause they're just reshuffling the chairs
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.320]   is all they're doing, in my opinion.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.840]   - Let's talk about tips, okay?
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.240]   Last year, we talked a lot about tips,
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.680]   treasury inflation protected securities.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.360]   At that point, their real after-inflation yields
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.360]   were hovering at a rich 2.4% at multiple maturities.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.720]   Now they're in the 1 1/2 to 2% range.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.360]   I'm wondering how you feel about tips now.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.920]   Do you feel as strongly about them
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.820]   as just a core part of portfolios?
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.760]   - Rates are about where they were two years ago
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.120]   when I built my tips ladder.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.460]   Now, if I could time the market,
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.560]   I would have waited 'til a few months ago.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.720]   But yeah, I don't know what they're gonna be in the future,
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.840]   but a 2% guaranteed real return is great.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.920]   And I wrote a piece, "Wealth Without Risk,"
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.560]   and it was using $100,000, put $53,000,
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.520]   not a tips ladder, but one tips
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.320]   that's gonna mature in 25 years.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.080]   It'll mature at $100,000.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.880]   The other $47,000 in the total stock market index fund,
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.360]   do nothing for 25 years, and you've got no risk.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.040]   If the market goes to zero,
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.680]   you still get your $100,000 back.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.960]   But if the market does like it's done in the past,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.960]   you've got a no risk, 5% above inflation real return.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.680]   - Yeah, there are a couple different ways
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.440]   to look at the question, but the easiest way
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.440]   is to think back in the year 2000 when tips yielded 4%,
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.520]   or in 2008, at the end of 2008,
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.640]   when they yielded in excess of 3%.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.800]   Gosh, why didn't I buy them then?
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.480]   Well, the reason why you didn't buy them then
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.360]   was because a dollar put into the stock market in 2000
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:37.360]   or in 2008 is now worth, you know, $7, $8, $9 now,
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.160]   which will buy you a whole lot more tips.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.920]   And the same thing is even true over the past year.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.680]   When we were at this conference less than a year ago,
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.040]   as Karen pointed out, tips were yielding
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.920]   a whole lot more than they are now, 2.4, 2.5.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.240]   You could buy, there were places in the tips yield curve
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.000]   where on that date you could buy tips at almost a 2.7% yield.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.560]   Gosh, why didn't I buy them then?
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.600]   Well, because a dollar put into the stock market then
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.680]   is now worth $1.35 or $1.40 now,
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.200]   and you will more than make up that difference
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.680]   in the tips price.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.360]   So the lesson that I take from this
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.840]   is don't buy tips unless you're old,
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.400]   which I am.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.440]   - I have a lot to say about this.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.760]   So first off, I'm a student
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.560]   of complex adaptive systems science.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.800]   How many peeps do I have in here?
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.180]   You guys don't, oh, yay, one.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.640]   What is complex adaptive systems science?
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.080]   It is we have no idea about the future.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.560]   We cannot predict unpredictable.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.760]   Things are unpredictable.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.000]   So just like the markets are unpredictable,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.480]   earthquakes, hurricanes, which I'm so grateful to be here
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.520]   'cause I live in Florida and so I got here late last night.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.720]   They're all unpredictable.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.240]   Inflation is unpredictable.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.040]   And so I'm gonna say something here
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.800]   and I'm probably gonna get so many arrows.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.440]   We have never used tips.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.640]   Oh, isn't that scary?
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.960]   We do not time the market.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.520]   We make sure our clients are invested
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.640]   with their ability to take risk.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.920]   Again, I'm saying that over and over,
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.520]   but our most aggressive clients
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.800]   are gonna have 20% fixed income
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.560]   because if the market crashes,
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.760]   they have money to rebalance into equities
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.840]   and our more conservative clients
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.520]   are gonna maybe 80% fixed income,
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.000]   which a lot of people cried,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.560]   but due to the low income years,
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.600]   but they slept very soundly,
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.360]   not having to worry about the unpredictable future.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.800]   And they understood what they were getting into
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.960]   with those portfolios.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.280]   And so for us, for fixed income,
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.640]   for our clients who have bond portfolios
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.880]   better than 200 to 250,000,
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.280]   we use individual municipal bonds
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.480]   and we use individual taxable municipal bonds.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.800]   We don't like the tax treatment of tips
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   in taxable accounts.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.960]   So that's an issue.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.960]   Another reason we don't use them.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.520]   And then there's the whole argument
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.600]   of bond funds versus individual bonds.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.440]   We just love that.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.680]   And you can look at all the data.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.400]   I don't think there's a straight answer for us.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.200]   We love the capital preservation
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.760]   of using high quality individual municipal bonds
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.720]   that are insured.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.440]   I've been doing this 25 years.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.140]   It hasn't failed me yet.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.800]   And so that is my answer on tips.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.680]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.520]   That was loud.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.600]   - Yeah, I think that first of all,
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.240]   leaving the tax question aside about tips and treasuries.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.920]   Let's just ignore the tax side of it
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.280]   and just talk about diversification.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.280]   That in addition to your total bond market index fund
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.800]   that you could have an element of a tips index fund
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.440]   in your portfolio because one of the segments
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.440]   of the total bond market index that's not there,
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.360]   it's not included,
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.600]   is Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.520]   I did a podcast with the people who created that index.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.960]   There's a long story behind it.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.120]   They wanted to include tips in the total bond market index.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.520]   It was the vendors or the people
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.560]   who were running total bond market index funds
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.480]   that didn't want tips in there.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.960]   So they took it out.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.200]   So in order to get that into your portfolio,
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.600]   to have a more complete total bond market,
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.920]   total bond market allocation,
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.720]   you would need, say, an element of tips.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.280]   So if you had 20% tips in your portfolio,
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.640]   you're actually rounding out
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.480]   your total bond market index fund with tips.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.000]   After that, whether you're gonna buy individual tips
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.640]   or a fund, I mean, I like to keep it simple.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.840]   I just rather use a fund.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.760]   - And Bill, when you said about tips
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.040]   are for people who are older,
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.840]   would you not use them in a portfolio
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.760]   during the accumulation years?
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   - Yes, I would, or no, I would not use them
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.200]   in the accumulation phase for that simple reason
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.440]   that the expected return of stocks
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.640]   is higher than that of tips.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.800]   And if you have a 20, 30, 40, 50 year horizon,
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.320]   you don't need them in your portfolio.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.000]   When you need them in your portfolio
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.400]   is when you are much older and you are accumulating
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.080]   and you do not wish to take the risk
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.000]   of significant inflation,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.080]   which is a near constant in economic history.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.800]   - But so in the accumulation years,
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.200]   if some, for the part of a portfolio
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.680]   that is not in equities,
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.840]   where would you suggest it be?
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.200]   - Well, in the first place,
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.160]   if you're in the accumulation part of your portfolio,
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.800]   you should be very stock heavy.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.440]   As Carolyn explained, if you're 40 years old,
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.640]   you really should have,
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.960]   you're not gonna be retiring for another 20 or 30 years.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.040]   You should have very little in the way of bonds
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.920]   in your portfolio.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.880]   You don't need that money for 20 or 30 years.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.600]   Why would you invest it in a low yielding asset?
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.480]   Now, there is a good reason for doing it,
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.040]   which is the psychological aspect of it.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.240]   So the question is, where do you put your money,
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.000]   if not in tips?
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.400]   Tips aren't a bad place to put them,
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:19.320]   but treasury bills aren't a bad place to put them either.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.600]   At last report, Berkshire Hathaway,
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.160]   Mr. Buffett had 30% of his assets in treasury bills.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.520]   He's not a stupid man.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.640]   - So in our portfolios for 25 years,
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.280]   in the fixed income portion, in the tax deferred account,
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.000]   we've been 50% intermediate bonds, governments,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.400]   30% short term governments, and 20% in tips.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.360]   And that's never changed again
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:53.320]   because that's there just to protect against the downside
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.600]   because many of us, I'm in the period of accumulation,
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.560]   by the way, I hope we all are.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.920]   And so, but I still have a limit
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.680]   as to how much I'm willing to lose.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.200]   So those bonds are there for no other reason,
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.920]   and that's why they're governments,
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.560]   because they're the most defensive thing
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.560]   that I know to do to keep the losses that I will sustain
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.160]   when it all comes apart to the limit
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.640]   that my wife and I have.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.960]   And so it's been the same for many, many years.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.880]   - I wanna say something to all this.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.160]   It's like everybody's different.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.480]   I have 40 year olds, I even have 30 year olds
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.880]   that have plenty of money, they know their number,
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.640]   they know what they need for financial independence,
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.600]   and they love their bonds.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.840]   They don't care about growing a gazillion dollars
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.440]   'cause they're financially independent
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.840]   and given what they're doing now.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.560]   And so that's why the important part
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.520]   of maintaining financial independence
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.000]   because you can't predict your life
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.400]   is knowing what it is you need to spend going forward.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.840]   And the most important part of a financial plan
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.400]   that I don't see hardly anybody doing
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.720]   is you need to revisit spending and redo projections
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.840]   based on spending every year,
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.840]   and your portfolio allocation should be based on that,
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.600]   not whether you're trying to make the most money
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.920]   and trying to figure out what the market's gonna do
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.660]   for the next 20 or 30 years.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:30.200]   - Earlier this month, the Fed cut rates
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.400]   for the first time in over four years.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.840]   The consensus is more rate cuts are ahead.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.160]   Does that change your thinking
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.960]   about any of your investments or your allocations?
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.520]   - Yeah, I wanna say something to that first.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:47.520]   So our firm is an ensemble,
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.960]   and so we all are specializing in something,
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.660]   and I actually have an investment manager,
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.280]   so I'm embarrassed to say I'm not our investment specialist
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.040]   in our firm, but we all know everything going on, right?
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.960]   And so my investment manager, this wonder kid of age 26,
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:06.080]   he shows this great chart of how interest rates go up
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.800]   kind of a little slow,
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.120]   and then when they start cutting, they cut like this,
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.080]   and then you get flat up,
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.360]   and then maybe a little peak, and then flat.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.840]   And so I remember, since I'm old,
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.520]   I remember in 2006, '07,
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.280]   that interest rates were pretty decent,
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.920]   and we were buying a lot of,
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.760]   then the wonder kid was not born yet.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.960]   I had a different investment manager at that point.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:33.220]   But same philosophy, the young kid learned
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.720]   from the older guy.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.000]   We just loaded up on bonds,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.520]   and individual bonds that were going out
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.320]   in 2015, 2016, so when the market dropped in 2009,
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.000]   interest rates went, choo, clients loved us.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.360]   And so we did the same thing this time.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.960]   Soon as those interest rates went up,
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.800]   we said to clients, now's the time,
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.900]   let's take as much cash off the table,
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.520]   'cause everybody loves cash, 'cause if it's paying 5%,
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.920]   I'm like, rates are gonna drop.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.480]   We show 'em that beautiful chart that said,
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.820]   ooh, put more in bonds, put more in bonds,
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.560]   and that's what we did.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.640]   - The Fed tells us what they are planning on doing
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.360]   with the Fed funds rate, which is the overnight rate.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.280]   It's not even one day.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.520]   The top economists, as measured by the Wall Street Journal,
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.240]   have called the direction, up or down,
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.200]   on the 10-year Treasury, correct,
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.360]   about 40% of the time, less than a coin flip.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   So the only thing it changes is perhaps when to go,
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.280]   I'm a believer now that it's okay
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.360]   to have some short-term bonds,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.840]   but when total bonds starts yielding,
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:44.080]   let's say, a percentage point more than the short-term,
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.960]   then you're being compensated for taking on
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.480]   a bit more interest rate risk.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.400]   Always keep credit quality high.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.440]   The Total Bond Fund follows
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.800]   the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index,
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.440]   which used to be the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.960]   I mentioned that yesterday.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.120]   - One of my touchtones is the famous
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.440]   Bernard Baruch statement,
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.680]   it's something that everyone knows isn't worth knowing.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.720]   And so almost immediately when I hear
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.360]   the terms Federal Reserve,
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.000]   my brain immediately shuts down and I stop listening.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   - I haven't made any changes and don't recommend it.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.840]   Did the Fed cut a half, so what are we at,
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.840]   four and a half now on, say, a three-month T-bill, roughly?
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.880]   Well, that's a good rate.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.000]   I mean, so if you've got Treasury bills
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.960]   and part of your allocation is just to roll Treasury bills,
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.200]   I mean, there's no change there.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.960]   If your Fed is starting to cut,
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.360]   so, I mean, usually that's good for the equity market,
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.280]   so there's no change there.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.200]   The Fed cut, but the intermediate and long-term rates
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.960]   kind of stayed the same, didn't do anything,
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.960]   so there's no change there, so no change.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.080]   - Okay, no change.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.840]   - One more thing, as Carolyn touched on,
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.240]   the joy of owning a long bond when there's a market crash.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.280]   But there are two kinds of market crashes, okay?
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.680]   There's the financial panic one,
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.920]   where the financial system shuts down
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.400]   and there, Treasuries are golden.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.520]   The asset that you want to own is the long bond, okay?
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.840]   But there's another kind of market crash,
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.640]   which occurs when the Fed tightens dramatically
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.240]   and then bonds go down,
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.680]   and so you may not want to own the long bond.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.640]   Long bond was not a particularly good asset
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.640]   to own in the year 2022.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.520]   - I want to clarify, though,
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.280]   that we hold all bonds to maturity.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.960]   We don't trade bonds, so.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.280]   - Wanted to ask a question about another thing
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.600]   that is going on in the world beyond us.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.480]   We're now less than six weeks to a presidential election.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.920]   Without saying anything about your politics
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.360]   or the individual candidates,
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.120]   does the upcoming election affect any of your thinking
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.760]   or things you are doing as investors?
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.000]   - I think it has a lot to do,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.320]   perhaps when we find out who wins,
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.680]   you may make some shifts to your estate planning,
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.880]   depending on what happens with the sunset of the,
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.560]   we know this is law already, right?
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.120]   The sunset of the Trump tax cuts.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.000]   They're gonna go away in 2026,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.960]   and that could affect your estate planning,
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.880]   and you may have to do some new estate planning.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.560]   Other than that, I don't think so.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.760]   - Tax law changes, as you mentioned, Rick,
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.360]   could certainly cause some changes in the financial plan,
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.400]   but I won't know anything the rest of the market
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.480]   doesn't already know after the election,
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.040]   so I will not change a thing,
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.880]   and I've written pieces ad nauseam.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.000]   Don't do anything based on,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.900]   you don't like the candidate that won.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.880]   - I love this question, by the way,
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.160]   'cause we have clients from all across
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.720]   the political spectrum, and they'll call
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.760]   when they're worried about the potential candidates
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.520]   gonna be elected from both sides,
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.820]   and we actually have this newsletter
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.120]   that we wrote a long time ago,
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.140]   'cause if you look at all the studies,
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.440]   basically elections don't affect the markets,
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:17.440]   and we take that same exact newsletter every four years,
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.760]   and we just put new lipstick on the pig,
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.200]   and we send that newsletter out again every time.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.000]   And I do think that one of the most important jobs
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.320]   of an investment advisor is to be there
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.900]   to talk them through that decision.
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:39.440]   John was about my age, I think,
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:44.440]   when I was a younger advisor, and Clinton had been elected,
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.800]   and he called up and said, "Sell everything.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.120]   "I do not wanna be in the market
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.820]   "with Clinton as the president."
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:57.400]   And I talked for 45 minutes, and I won.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.480]   And it wasn't that I was voting or cheering
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.240]   for who the president might be,
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.040]   but that I didn't want people to use that
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.240]   as a market timing tool.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.380]   And if you do, there's no evidence that it works.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.440]   - Yeah, I mean, you know, it's a truism
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.800]   that you tell your kids, and what your mama told you,
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.560]   is don't discuss religion or politics with strangers,
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.500]   but it shouldn't have anything to do
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.940]   with the way you manage your portfolio.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.980]   Not a single thing, neither religion nor politics.
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.360]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:34.460]   Changing gears a little bit, over the past few years,
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.620]   many Bogle heads have been dismayed
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.420]   by the quality of service at Vanguard.
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.940]   Should investors who have been loyal users
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.980]   of Vanguard funds consider buying those funds
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.100]   or other funds on platforms other than Vanguard?
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.260]   - Yeah, I want Alan to answer that,
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.500]   'cause he wrote an excellent article on that.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.360]   - You know, I'm not gonna make any excuses.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.520]   Vanguard service has really gone down,
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.260]   and I still have a flagship advisor,
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.420]   so I can imagine how hard it is for a lot of people.
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.080]   You know, I can say I'm encouraged.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.500]   I sent a blind email to Salim Ramji, the new CEO.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.820]   He responded kind of like, just like Jack Bogle.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.100]   And I wrote, I asked him 10 questions
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.060]   in an article that I wrote about,
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.980]   and one thing that's not in the article,
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.820]   he's saying all the right things,
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.380]   but one thing that's not in the article,
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:34.100]   Michael Nolan, Jack Bogle's last number two
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:39.100]   and fiercely loyal, the interview was conducted in a video,
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:43.580]   and Mike was smiling the whole time.
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.380]   It was as if Jack Bogle was looking down
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.180]   and listening to his answers.
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.220]   So I'm really encouraged,
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.560]   but it's not gonna be an easy task
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.940]   to fix things at a company that size,
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.940]   but I think they are making progress,
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.360]   and I'm really encouraged.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:04.840]   - A lot of people are moving their assets out of Vanguard
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:09.180]   and moving them to, say, Fidelity.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:12.780]   A lot of people moving to Fidelity, which is fine.
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:13.940]   Fidelity's a good firm.
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.300]   They have great service,
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.940]   but I have to warn you, when you do that,
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.700]   you are going to be asked to meet
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.580]   with a Fidelity financial representative.
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:29.780]   I hasten to call them financial advisors
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.300]   because their only advice is going to be
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.260]   sell whatever you got at Vanguard
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.860]   and get into our separately managed account program.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:40.140]   I had a client, a couple of weeks ago,
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:45.100]   moved 15 million from Vanguard over to Fidelity.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.700]   I had a $5 million position in VTI,
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.900]   the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF,
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.480]   in a taxable trust account
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:57.060]   that had over a $2 million unrealized gain,
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:01.620]   and the recommendation of the Fidelity advisor was,
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.420]   "You're under-diversified.
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.120]   "You need to sell this position
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.060]   "and put your money in a separately managed account."
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.020]   I mean--
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.620]   - Yeah, I have a small rolling treasury ladder at Fidelity,
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.860]   which they will do.
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.700]   It's a wonderful service,
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.600]   and once a month, I get a little email from them
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.640]   telling me that my portfolio is horribly under-diversified.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:28.020]   The alternative, in terms of big custodians, is Schwab,
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:28.980]   and they're fine, too.
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.700]   You're not gonna be harassed by their representatives much,
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.220]   but you will spend the rest of your life
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.980]   policing their sweep vehicle,
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.060]   which yields 40 basis points.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:43.300]   - As investors, we are often looking
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:48.300]   for rules of thumb, guidelines for what we do.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.260]   In my conversations getting ready for this panel,
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.700]   I thought it was interesting
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.980]   that both Paul Merriman and Alan Roth
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.580]   said that there are a lot of situations
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.180]   where half this, half that
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.220]   can be a really useful bit of guidance,
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:04.220]   so I'm gonna ask you, Paul,
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.480]   can you start us off by telling us about your 50/50s?
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:14.860]   - I am 50/50 buy and hold and market timing.
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.820]   (audience laughs)
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.600]   I am, and I am 50/50 U.S. and international,
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:26.260]   and I'm 50/50 basically growth and value,
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.300]   so you add all those 50s up,
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:33.100]   and I don't know how much more diversified I could be,
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:37.580]   and by the way, I was, at a point in my career,
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.940]   very knowledgeable about market timing,
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.340]   and I concluded it is not something
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.860]   that the individual person should ever try to do,
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:51.180]   which is why I don't do it,
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.780]   and even though I was an investment advisor in my retirement,
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.740]   the last thing I wanna worry about is our money,
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.760]   so I have an investment advisor
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.700]   to make sure that everything gets done
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.660]   because my emotions are such,
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.960]   when the market starts down, I get very protective,
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.900]   and I've learned to keep my hands off.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.780]   After all, I am 50/50.
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.740]   - So my question for you, what is your goal for your money?
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.640]   - Well, my first goal is to make sure
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.820]   that Western Washington University gets enough money
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:30.820]   to educate their students on financial literacy.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.660]   That's my first goal.
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.720]   My second goal is, we already have it set up
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.140]   so that my wife will be okay.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.100]   I did what I advocate to everybody that can do it.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.140]   I over-saved.
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:48.140]   I did not retire until I had way more than I really needed,
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:54.420]   so my goal is for it to grow, but not too fast
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:57.740]   because I don't like the risk if it grows too fast,
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.600]   but I also would like to see it grow a moderate amount,
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   so if I got a 6% or 7% return over the years, I'd be fine.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:12.160]   - In the words of that great financial authority,
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.600]   Yogi Berra, 50% of this game is 90% mental,
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.040]   and splitting the difference
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.300]   when you have a big decision to make,
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.600]   50/50 one way or the other is generally a good way
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.460]   of accomplishing the main psychological chore
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.180]   which you have, which is minimizing regret.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.120]   Alan, tell us about some of your 50/50s.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.820]   - Harry Markowitz, the father of modern portfolio theory
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.560]   who does all these calculations
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.300]   to determine the optimal efficient portfolio
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.100]   was once asked, what's your portfolio allocation,
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.340]   and he said 50% to minimize regret.
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:52.520]   There are other reasons.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.340]   If you look at Morningstar's safe spin rates,
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:00.780]   it tends to maximize somewhere around 50% bonds,
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.180]   50% stocks, you get more of a boost
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.420]   from rebalancing at 50%.
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:10.100]   Paul, my portfolio was also at 50%.
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.360]   Other things like if a client has,
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.620]   let's say as an officer of a company,
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.500]   and they've got 80% of their net worth
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.380]   in their company's stock,
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.920]   oftentimes we say let's sell half over the next year or two.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.140]   If it goes up, they can be happy that they had it
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.500]   and blame Alan Roth for selling it.
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.740]   If it goes down, they can pat themselves on the back.
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.700]   Dollar cost averaging.
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.060]   If you inherit a lot of money, you sell your company.
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.840]   I think a couple years ago, the panel was asked,
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.520]   do you dollar cost average or put it all in immediately?
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.880]   And mathematically, you put it all in immediately,
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.640]   but we're emotional animals,
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.500]   we're not logical, rational animals,
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.900]   so often selling half, obviously,
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.700]   the shares that have the highest cost basis.
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:02.620]   And then traditional versus Roth?
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.780]   My answer is yes.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.340]   We do not know what tax laws are going to be.
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:10.700]   We know that our income is gonna go down in retirement,
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.300]   but we don't know what tax laws will be.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.840]   Logic says with our debt and deficit,
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.260]   taxes have to go up,
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:22.360]   but logic and politics really don't have much in common.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.340]   - Let me put in a pitch here now.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.660]   If you have questions, please write them down.
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.660]   If you have a question waiting to be collected,
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.940]   please raise your hand.
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.940]   We have a couple of people coming around
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.260]   to collect your questions
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.500]   'cause we'll try and get to those quite soon.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:44.100]   Wanted to talk briefly about international stocks.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.740]   This year has been another one
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.900]   where international stocks are trailing
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.060]   far behind US stocks.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:54.660]   The Vanguard Total International Stock Index is up 14%.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.500]   Total US Index Fund up 20.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:03.220]   Looking over the past 15 years on an annualized basis,
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:08.220]   US beats international 14% to 6%.
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.320]   Jack Bogle was famously unconvinced
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.980]   that one needed to own international stocks,
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.880]   although Victor made some really interesting points
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.580]   about the valuation impact on that decision.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.460]   So I'm wondering what your thinking is
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:27.580]   on should I own international stocks?
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.260]   - Yeah, I think the point that Victor made this morning
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.100]   was quite an incisive one,
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.220]   that you're basically buying a large part
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.380]   of the US economy at a discount
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.980]   when you buy international stocks.
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.780]   But the other way to look at it
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.960]   is to say that the PE,
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:47.180]   by whatever measure you want,
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.300]   of international stocks is half that of US stocks.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.380]   So what you're saying is that the US per share growth
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.780]   in earnings is going to grow over the foreseeable future
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.580]   twice as fast as those of international companies will.
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.160]   And I think that's a very strong assumption.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.580]   Eventually you'll be happy
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.620]   you bought international stocks, just not yet.
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:19.660]   - Okay, so why are international stocks so important?
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:23.740]   Why are international stocks not doing as well as US stocks?
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.660]   And you really gotta look under the hood
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:27.940]   and see that, well, here in this country,
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:31.740]   in the United States, we are blessed with some very large,
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:36.100]   very successful, leading tech companies
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.900]   that are making a lot of money
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.100]   and that are not influenced by higher interest rates
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.860]   because they don't finance the balance sheet
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.340]   by borrowing money.
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:49.260]   So we're in a great spot.
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.220]   By the way, thank you for telling me
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.980]   what international stocks versus US stocks have done
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.780]   and small cap, 'cause I don't really know.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.860]   So I appreciate that.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.060]   So international stocks apparently
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.540]   have underperformed again this year, I guess.
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:06.740]   But international stocks are in different industry groups.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.820]   If you look at what underlines what's out there
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.980]   outside the US, we're talking about a lot
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:16.700]   of industrial stocks, material stocks, energy stocks,
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.200]   things like mining companies.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.500]   I mean, it's almost like what the S&P looked like
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.340]   50 years ago here in the United States.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.620]   That's what it looks like overseas.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.260]   We buy a lot of that stuff, by the way,
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.100]   that they make and they mine, so we buy that.
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.420]   We're consumers of that.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:36.500]   In the long term, if you have about 30% to 40%
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.940]   in international, it is a good diversification benefit.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.820]   You get individual stock diversification,
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:47.380]   you're now getting a lot of industry diversification,
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.500]   and you're getting currency diversification.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.060]   Again, we've been blessed in this country
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.220]   with the US dollar being strong.
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.860]   It's not always that way.
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.500]   So my opinion is you should have about,
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.660]   to make it simple, and I like to keep things simple,
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.340]   2/3 in the US, 1/3 in international,
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.260]   using total stock market US,
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.220]   total stock market international
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.300]   is a very good allocation to hold for the long term.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.140]   And by the way, the one thing
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.860]   about international, which is interesting,
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.800]   the dividend yield on that now is over 3%.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.020]   So now I'm telling people, well,
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.300]   if you're in a high tax bracket,
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.420]   you might wanna think about putting your international
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.900]   in your tax-deferred or tax-free account
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.460]   because the dividend yield is so high.
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.380]   - Jack Bogle has been right, even since his passing,
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:33.140]   and I am the most argumentative person in the world,
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.260]   although I completely agree with Rick on this point.
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.260]   I don't only buy Colorado stocks.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:41.060]   You shouldn't only buy stocks in your state.
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:45.460]   Diversification is very important,
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.760]   and the next magnificent seven or 17 or whatever
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.700]   might be international stock.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:54.500]   And don't forget, they have some wars going on,
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.100]   and hopefully that will get resolved
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.800]   and is part of the reason
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.100]   why international has performed so poorly.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:01.940]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.780]   Let's move on.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.620]   - Yeah, one thing, by the way,
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:06.340]   we got a 6% return over the last 15 years.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.500]   I mean, if you think about it,
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.420]   the expected return from equity
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.220]   is only maybe 4% over the risk-free rate, okay?
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.780]   And assuming that the natural risk-free rate
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:18.060]   out there is 3%,
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.460]   that would make the return of stock about 7%.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.360]   We've only been 1% below that.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.900]   What's dwarfing this whole thing
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.260]   is the great return of U.S. stocks.
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.780]   So it really hasn't been bad for international.
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:33.740]   It's just that U.S. looks so great relative to it.
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.580]   - Good point.
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.900]   Okay, we're gonna move on to some audience questions.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.340]   Is there a reason to buy actively managed bond funds
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.860]   instead of just a bond index fund?
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:48.020]   I've been told since bond rates are somewhat predictable,
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.620]   active management is better.
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.740]   - No.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.700]   - Yes, but only if you're selling them
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.020]   and you can make a lot of money, but absolutely not.
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:03.860]   - Well, the Vanguard Municipal Bond Funds,
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.020]   not their new index funds,
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.500]   but their Municipal Bond Funds are actively managed.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:13.300]   So as I say, they look more like a Municipal Bond Index Fund
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.500]   because they have more holdings
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.260]   than most Municipal Bond Index Funds.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.260]   But so no, you don't need active management.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:24.220]   - Yeah, I'm a Tobin separation theorem fundamentalist,
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.740]   which means that you have risky assets on one side
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.440]   and riskless assets on the other side.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:35.440]   And so the only bonds that I wanna own are U.S. Treasuries.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.320]   Thank you.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.260]   If I wanna take credit risk, I'll buy stocks
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.580]   'cause that's where you're getting the credit premium from.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:45.300]   It's basically an equity premium that you're taking.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.940]   And so there's no need to buy a fund
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.100]   if you're just buying U.S. Treasuries,
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.360]   just buy Treasuries at auction.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.700]   You don't even have to pay Vanguard
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.980]   three or four basis points of expense ratio.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:55.820]   Why do it?
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:59.700]   - Another question, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.060]   have been cited a number of times.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.740]   What are your thoughts about including Berkshire Hathaway
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.940]   in a portfolio?
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.100]   - No.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:14.580]   It's a very low cost mutual fund type.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.260]   It's not a mutual fund, but it's a type of thing.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.320]   Typically, if somebody has it and they have a gain,
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.340]   I'm not gonna sell it, but I don't recommend
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.460]   owning it outside of my total stock index fund.
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:28.660]   - You get this a lot when people do not want income
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.820]   in their taxable portfolio.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:31.900]   They don't even want a dividend,
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.020]   even the 1.5% or so dividend
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.420]   that the U.S. stock market is paying.
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.160]   They don't even want that.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.260]   So they say, well, what if I just bought
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:43.380]   all Berkshire Hathaway, and I can't agree with that.
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.500]   I think you're better off buying a total stock market
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.020]   and paying the tax on the 1.5% dividend.
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:52.020]   - A question, we talk a lot about stocks,
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.980]   bonds, international stocks.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.620]   Do you believe that real estate or REITs
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.980]   or real estate ETFs should have a place
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.820]   in a diversified portfolio?
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:06.740]   - You own REITs within a total stock index fund.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:11.740]   With that said, the vast majority of commercial real estate
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.060]   is not in public markets.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:19.540]   So I certainly believe that you can put some
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.660]   of the Vanguard REIT index fund in there,
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.440]   but you've gotta stick with it.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:28.260]   And the correlations with stocks are low,
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.260]   but that's not negative.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:33.300]   Negative means they typically move in opposite directions.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.240]   So I think there is some reason
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:39.100]   to have a little bit of a ultra low cost REIT index fund.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.740]   - The most popular piece we ever wrote
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:46.660]   was entitled The Ultimate Buy and Hold Strategy.
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:50.460]   And there wasn't really anything ultimate about it,
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.760]   but people would read it.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:57.180]   What it did say is that here are 10
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.740]   different equity asset classes.
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:03.700]   And by the way, we still update this article every year.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.140]   And those 10 equity asset classes are large-cap blend,
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.700]   large-cap value, small-cap blend, small-cap value,
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:14.680]   international small-cap blend and small-cap value,
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.560]   international large-cap blend and large-cap value,
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.400]   and REITs.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.320]   And if you build a portfolio,
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:28.320]   10% in each of those great equity asset classes,
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:33.400]   it has historically, in the past, worked out quite well.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.720]   And produced a very nice unit of return per unit of risk.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:44.560]   So I do believe that in a tax-deferred or tax-free account,
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.920]   REITs would be a legitimate thing to own.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:51.520]   - For us, you noticed I didn't say no at the beginning.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.080]   So we do own about, for portfolios,
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:59.500]   about 5% REITs in clients tax-deferred
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.880]   or tax-free accounts, usually tax-deferred.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.760]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.440]   You should only own them in a tax-deferred account.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.640]   REITs have had historically very high returns.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.600]   And I believe that one of the reasons for that
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.960]   is because the federal law mandates
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:18.880]   they have to pay out 90% of their earnings in dividends.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.680]   And unfortunately, large industrial corporations
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.600]   and technology firms have an alarming tendency
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.560]   of wasting internally-generated capital
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.680]   on less-than-optimal projects.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.760]   And so federal law saves REITs from doing that.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.720]   And that's one of the reasons why the returns are so good.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.040]   So I think that over-weighting them
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.720]   is probably not a bad idea.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.560]   - So I wrote a piece for Forbes,
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.720]   I don't know how long ago it was, maybe 15 years ago,
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:49.600]   called The Total Economy Portfolio.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:54.240]   So allocating your equity allocation a little bit more
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.960]   to what the economy is rather than what the stock market is.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.460]   Because we can't make a decision
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.220]   whether a company's gonna capitalize themselves
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:06.320]   privately or with debt or by going public
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.440]   in the stock market.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.320]   So there are certain industry groups out there
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:15.000]   that have very small amount of allocation
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.240]   to the stock market, like real estate,
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.760]   but they're a huge part of the economy,
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.480]   well over 10% of the economy is commercial real estate
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.200]   when you look at national income.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.080]   So if you wanted your portfolio to look more like
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.040]   the economy rather than the stock market,
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:33.120]   then you could put maybe 10% of your equity allocation,
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:37.080]   could go to real estate and that nudges the portfolio
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.440]   more towards what the economy looks like.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.280]   And I'll add to that, Paul will like this,
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.600]   that small cap value mirrors private equity
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:51.640]   as far as the return and risk in many ways.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.480]   So if you wanted to include private equity
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.280]   in your portfolio, you don't need to go out
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.540]   and buy private equity funds,
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:01.220]   you could buy a small cap value index fund
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:04.680]   and that, again, looks more like the economy
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.200]   than it does the stock market.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.780]   Now, is all this necessary?
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:10.360]   No, not really, but it makes for a good story
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:14.020]   for Forbes and they liked it.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.640]   - You were doing so well, Rick.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.100]   (laughing)
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:20.780]   - So you can, if you wanna add real estate, that's fine.
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.020]   If you don't, that's fine too.
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.780]   - If someone calls you up with a private real estate deal,
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:26.620]   hang up.
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.400]   (laughing)
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.200]   - A different kind of question.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.240]   As the deficit grows, do you think the government
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:38.040]   could change laws to tax Roth IRAs?
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.640]   Should I be worried about that?
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.460]   - I'm gonna, I wanna grab this one before all the guys do.
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.620]   So first off, you have to remember the government
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:48.540]   is not a household and that deficits,
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:51.860]   if you don't have, whoa, this is getting bad.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.780]   Should everybody turn theirs off and yeah,
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.340]   maybe that'll help, yeah.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.660]   So deficits do matter because you have to worry
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:03.280]   about inflation, but the government year to year
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.580]   can change how they deal with the deficits.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:10.580]   We don't ever have to totally pay back the whole deficit.
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:13.260]   And in fact, that would create austerity.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:17.500]   So you can't predict the future of taxes.
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.300]   I do think tax rates will go up at some point
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.660]   because we're at the lowest tax rates ever.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:26.460]   We have great discrepancy in income inequality
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.660]   compared to a long time,
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.620]   which tends to cause social unrest.
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:32.120]   That's the reason taxes need to go up.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.660]   So it will happen.
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.900]   Will they make Roths, so the question was,
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.220]   will they start taxing Roths?
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.780]   I, you know, that's political suicide.
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.460]   So I don't think they're gonna go back on what's been done.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:49.000]   They just usually, and I worked in Washington, guys,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.940]   so I know a lot of how Washington works
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:53.540]   and how their brains think.
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.180]   And so what's gonna happen is they will change
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.660]   the rules going forward for the most part.
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:01.340]   And I know everybody on this panel
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:02.580]   is gonna say something different
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.860]   because I'm a contrarian on tax and economic policy.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:09.100]   - Yeah, I'm gonna tell you all how the government
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:14.100]   financed its massive deficit for the stimulus package,
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.580]   various stimulus packages they had
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.940]   during the COVID epidemic.
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:21.340]   And the way they did it was by inflating the way
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.620]   the value of your dollars.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.640]   You were getting 0% on treasuries.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:29.620]   Prices went up by 20% over a three-year period.
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.320]   And that's how the government paid for that deficit
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.340]   was they just inflated it away.
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.380]   - They printed the money.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.260]   - When I started-- - Okay, but that's okay.
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.680]   - Sorry. - Sorry.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.620]   - When I started investing in 1963
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.060]   and then I became a stockbroker in '66.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:49.860]   But in that period, marginal tax rates were 90%
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.840]   and then dropped down to 70%.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.980]   And it seemed like people went to work
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:57.820]   as people go to work today
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:59.940]   trying to do the best that they could.
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:05.540]   And the bottom line is I tell young people today,
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:08.180]   get all the money you can into a Roth.
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:11.100]   We have no idea what future tax rates are going to be,
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:16.060]   but my gut tells me they could be 70% again.
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:18.880]   I mean, I know it's hard to believe that,
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.140]   but they could.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.700]   And I think it makes sense to try
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:26.300]   to get that money set aside and protect it.
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.900]   It'll be worth the price of admission,
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.980]   certainly if I'm right.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.580]   - Okay, I think we're gonna squeeze in one last question
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.020]   and then we're gonna wrap up.
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:40.180]   As more and more money is in index funds,
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.320]   does that mean that there's a very small percentage
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.240]   of the investors out there
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:49.380]   who are actually determining the value of securities?
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.300]   Should we be concerned about that?
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.160]   - No, absolutely not.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.460]   The whole thing is absurd.
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:57.240]   It's really a way for the active managers
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:01.380]   to try to say, hey, you need to invest with us
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:02.940]   because indexing is bad.
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:04.140]   Indexing is Marxism.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:05.060]   Indexing is this.
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:05.900]   Indexing is that.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:09.820]   I mean, I've been hearing this since what, 1976
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.100]   when indexes were first formed, right?
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.220]   Vogel's Folly, Vogel's Folly, right?
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:15.560]   The whole, I mean, we've been hearing this now
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.880]   for what, almost 50 years.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.900]   So the answer is no, we don't have to worry about that.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:25.180]   - If 90% of the market of stocks are indexed
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:28.740]   because active managers trade 10 times as much
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.500]   as passive managers do,
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.820]   that still means that 50% of price discovery
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.180]   is going to be done by active managers.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.460]   That's plenty.
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:38.340]   - Okay, listen, I'm gonna say thank you
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.940]   to our amazing panel.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:43.100]   (audience applauding)
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:44.940]   - Thank you.
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.860]   - And thank you to the audience
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.540]   for some really excellent questions as well.
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:53.700]   (audience applauding)
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.760]   you
