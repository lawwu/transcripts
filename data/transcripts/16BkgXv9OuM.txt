[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.380]   - Okay.
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.280]   I'm Karen D'Amato.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.400]   I came to my first Bogleheads meeting
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.040]   exactly 20 years ago this year.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.320]   What was then called Diehards 4 in Denver.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.520]   And I had the chance to come,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.740]   that one and a few others as a financial journalist
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.840]   at the Wall Street Journal and then at Money Magazine.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.720]   And since I've moved on in my career,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.640]   I've had the honor to come as an individual Boglehead
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.760]   and now as a member of the Bogle Center Board,
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.220]   which has been wonderful.
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.880]   And I work with an amazing group of people.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.680]   And I'm delighted to be up here moderating
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.520]   with our esteemed panel.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.000]   They are authors, financial advisors, educators.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.580]   Most of them have worn all those hats.
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.840]   They're widely recognized and quoted in the press.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.340]   I encourage you to read all the details of their bios.
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.020]   Also, everyone here has already spoken
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.080]   or will be speaking at one or more sessions
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.260]   during the conference.
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.000]   I want to include a particularly warm welcome
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.100]   to Carolyn McClanahan who is here
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.320]   for her first Bogleheads conference.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.480]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.360]   Carolyn is a physician turned financial planner.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.160]   She's the founder of Life Planning Partners.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.680]   And she also dodged a very hazardous hurricane
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.820]   to join us here.
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:51.320]   So going from your left over Bill Bernstein,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   Paul Merriman, Carolyn, Alan Roth and Rick Ferry.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.140]   We're gonna cover a bunch of topics
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.480]   and I'm gonna work hard to leave 10 minutes
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.000]   at the end for questions.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.320]   So please write questions on the cards.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.760]   People will be coming around to collect them.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.680]   Let's start off with the US stock market.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.560]   The last year has seen excellent performance
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.960]   when I looked at the Morningstar style box,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.760]   all sections of the style box are up at least 25%
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.560]   over the past 12 months.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.040]   But we've also seen that the market
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.920]   is extremely concentrated
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.080]   with the so-called magnificent seven stocks
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.840]   comprising over 30% of the S&P.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.360]   And I'm wondering your thoughts about
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.560]   should investors be concerned about that concentration
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.040]   because supposedly we're buying index funds
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.480]   for this wide diversification
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.840]   but are they still delivering that?
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.440]   - I wrote a piece roughly a couple months ago
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.840]   on is the market too concentrated.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.600]   There are over 12,000 publicly traded companies
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.760]   between the total US and total international
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.820]   stock index fund.
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.600]   And the top 10 companies account for over 20%
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.580]   of the global market cap.
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.960]   So I researched what has happened in the past
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.160]   not that that could assure what's gonna happen
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.180]   in the future.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.480]   And when markets go up, markets get more concentrated
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.040]   and we are at record concentration now.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.200]   But it's not predictive of when the market
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.540]   is going to go down.
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.800]   So I'm not a believer in value investing,
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.040]   I'm a believer in market cap investing.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.840]   So, and I love Paul.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.800]   It is a problem, it concerns me
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.000]   but I'm still going total market cap,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.560]   boring, low cost index funds.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.120]   So I don't have a solution but I do have a concern.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.400]   - Well, speaking as someone who has
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.080]   a somewhat opposing point of view
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.960]   and someone who is tilted although I have nothing wrong
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.980]   with the market cap approach,
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.840]   I'm sleeping a whole lot better at night these days.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.560]   - I'm sorry, explain that Bill.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.280]   - Well, the fact that I'm tilted away
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.400]   from the magnificent seven stocks
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.880]   makes me a lot more relaxed about the concentration
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.760]   in the markets since I'm not exposed to it.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.760]   I mean, a good day for me is a day when NVIDIA's down 5%.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.760]   - Bill, as you pointed out, I sleep well at night
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.100]   not by counting sheep but by counting my tips ladder.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.200]   - Oh, I'm sure we'll get to that.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.520]   So, you know, on a practical standpoint,
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.400]   we've always just invested in the total stock market index
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.840]   instead of the S&P 500 index
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.040]   'cause that mitigates a lot of the risk
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.880]   of overconcentration but if you look back at history,
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.640]   we go through periods of overconcentration
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.000]   in companies and it just rotates.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.180]   So what was overconcentrated 20 years ago
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.600]   is not overconcentrated now and through all that all,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.860]   the stock market has just continued to go up.
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.240]   So if you just stay fully diversified,
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.160]   I mean, widely diversified in total stock market,
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.240]   I think you're gonna be fine in the long term.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.800]   And again, the one part though is ideally,
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.320]   you have a portfolio allocation that's dedicated
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.720]   to your ability to take risks financially
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.120]   and psychologically so you have that fixed income set aside
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.640]   so that whatever happens,
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.680]   you're gonna sleep well all the time.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.200]   - I would agree that we come to a fork in the road
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.360]   as investors where we are either going to be market timers
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.920]   or we're going to be buy-in holders
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.780]   and we're either gonna build a portfolio
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.160]   based on what we see is gonna happen
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.200]   in the next five or 10 years
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.500]   or we just accept what happens
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.760]   for the next five or 10 years staying broadly diversified.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.240]   And I happen to live 40 feet
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.080]   from this gentleman on my right.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.640]   He unfortunately lives above me.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.300]   That's 'cause he's smarter.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.080]   But the bottom line is that
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.200]   when you're massively diversified,
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.080]   it really doesn't matter,
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.120]   except none of us like the market to go down
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.540]   and be in it when it's happening.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.620]   But other than that, I don't even worry.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.960]   I don't even look to see how the pieces of my portfolio
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.000]   have done this year.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.800]   It doesn't matter.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.560]   - Okay.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.400]   - Oh, I--
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.880]   - Oh, go on, Rick.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.720]   Hi, Rick.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.520]   - Okay, if you're a global equity investor,
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.860]   only thing you need to worry about
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.240]   as far as your portfolio is money coming out of the market
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.600]   and money going into the market.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.480]   Okay, once the money is in the market,
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.760]   whether it's in mega cap seven
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.640]   or it comes out of mega cap seven
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.000]   and goes more broadly to the mid caps
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.880]   or the small caps or maybe goes international,
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.040]   money is staying in the market,
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.880]   so your portfolio isn't gonna go down in value
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.760]   because it's like, okay, the fish moved
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.680]   from this part of the ocean to that part of the ocean,
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.920]   but you own the whole ocean.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.320]   So it doesn't matter that the fact
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.600]   is these magnificent seven.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.040]   As long as people are not pulling money out of stocks,
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.640]   then your portfolio will be fine
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.480]   'cause you're just reshuffling the chairs
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.280]   is all they're doing, in my opinion.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.480]   - Let's talk about TIPS.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.240]   Okay, last year, we talked a lot about TIPS,
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.680]   Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.360]   At that point, their real after-inflation yields
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.360]   were hovering at a rich 2.4% at multiple maturities.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.720]   Now they're in the 1 1/2 to 2% range.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.360]   I'm wondering how you feel about TIPS now.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.920]   Do you feel as strongly about them
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.820]   as just a core part of portfolios?
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.760]   - Rates are about where they were two years ago
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.120]   when I built my TIPS ladder.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.460]   Now, if I could time the market,
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.560]   I would have waited 'til a few months ago.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.720]   But yeah, I don't know what they're gonna be in the future,
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.840]   but a 2% guaranteed real return is great.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.920]   And I wrote a piece, "Wealth Without Risk,"
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.560]   and it was using $100,000, put $53,000,
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.520]   not a TIPS ladder, but one TIPS
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.320]   that's gonna mature in 25 years.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.080]   It'll mature at $100,000.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.880]   The other $47,000 in the total stock market index fund,
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.360]   do nothing for 25 years, and you've got no risk.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.040]   If the market goes to zero,
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.680]   you still get your $100,000 back.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.960]   But if the market does like it's done in the past,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.960]   you've got a no risk 5% above inflation real return.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.040]   - Yeah, there are a couple different ways
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.440]   to look at the question, but the easiest way
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.440]   is to think back in the year 2000 when TIPS yielded 4%,
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.520]   or in 2008, at the end of 2008,
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.640]   when they yielded in excess of 3%.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.800]   Gosh, why didn't I buy them then?
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.480]   Well, the reason why you didn't buy them then
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.360]   was because a dollar put into the stock market in 2000,
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:37.360]   or in 2008, is now worth seven, eight, $9 now,
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.120]   which will buy you a whole lot more TIPS.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.920]   And the same thing is even true over the past year.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.680]   When we were at this conference less than a year ago,
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.000]   as Karen pointed out, TIPS were yielding
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.880]   a whole lot more than they are now, 2.4, 2.5.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.200]   You could buy, there were places in the TIPS yield curve
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.000]   where on that date you could buy TIPS at almost a 2.7% yield.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.520]   Gosh, why didn't I buy them then?
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.560]   Well, because a dollar put into the stock market then
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.600]   is now worth a $1.35 or a $1.40 now,
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.160]   and you will more than make up that difference
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.600]   in the TIPS price.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.320]   So the lesson that I take from this
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.440]   is don't buy TIPS unless you're old.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.360]   Which I am.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   - I have a lot to say about this.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.720]   So first off, I'm a student
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.480]   of complex adaptive systems science.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.760]   How many peeps do I have in here?
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.120]   You guys don't, oh, yay, one.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.600]   What is complex adaptive systems science?
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.040]   It is, we have no idea about the future.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.520]   We cannot predict unpredictable.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.720]   Things are unpredictable.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.960]   So just like the markets are unpredictable,
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.440]   earthquakes, hurricanes, which I'm so grateful to be here,
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.480]   'cause I live in Florida, and so I got here late last night.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.680]   They're all unpredictable.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.200]   Inflation is unpredictable.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.000]   And so I'm gonna say something here,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.760]   and I'm probably gonna get so many arrows.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.400]   We have never used TIPS.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.640]   Oh, isn't that scary?
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.960]   We do not time the market.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.520]   We make sure our clients are invested
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.640]   with their ability to take risk.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.920]   Again, I'm saying that over and over,
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.520]   but our most aggressive clients
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.800]   are gonna have 20% fixed income,
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.560]   because if the market crashes,
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.760]   they have money to rebalance into equities.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.840]   And our more conservative clients
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.520]   are gonna maybe 80% fixed income,
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.000]   which a lot of people cried,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.560]   due to the low-income years,
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.600]   but they slept very soundly,
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.360]   not having to worry about the unpredictable future.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.800]   And they understood what they were getting into
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.960]   with those portfolios.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.280]   And so for us, for fixed income,
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.640]   for our clients who have bond portfolios
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.880]   better than 200 to 250,000,
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.280]   we use individual municipal bonds,
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.460]   and we use individual taxable municipal bonds.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.800]   We don't like the tax treatment of TIPS
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   in taxable accounts.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.960]   So that's an issue.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.960]   Another reason we don't use them.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.520]   And there's a whole argument
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.600]   of bond funds versus individual bonds.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.440]   We just love that.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.680]   And you can look at all the data.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.420]   I don't think there's a straight answer for us.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.200]   We love the capital preservation
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.760]   of using high-quality individual municipal bonds
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.720]   that are insured.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.440]   I've been doing this 25 years.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.140]   It hasn't failed me yet.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.800]   And so that is my answer on TIPS.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.680]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.520]   That was loud.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.600]   Yeah, I think that, first of all,
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.780]   leaving the tax question aside
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.280]   about TIPS and treasuries,
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.920]   let's just ignore the tax side of it
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.280]   and just talk about diversification.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.280]   That in addition to your total bond market index fund,
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.800]   that you could have an element of a TIPS index fund
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.440]   in your portfolio because one of the segments
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.440]   of the total bond market index that's not there,
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.360]   it's not included,
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.600]   is Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.520]   I did a podcast with the people who created that index.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.960]   There's a long story behind it.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.160]   They wanted to include TIPS
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.120]   in the total bond market index.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.540]   It was the vendors or the people
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.560]   who were running total bond market index funds
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.480]   that didn't want TIPS in there.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.960]   So they took it out.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.200]   So in order to get that into your portfolio,
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.600]   to have a more complete total bond market,
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.920]   total bond market allocation,
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.720]   you would need, say, an element of TIPS.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.280]   So if you had 20% TIPS in your portfolio,
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.640]   you're actually rounding out
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.480]   your total bond market index fund with TIPS.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.000]   After that, whether you're gonna buy individual TIPS
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.640]   or a fund, I mean, I like to keep it simple.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.840]   I just rather use a fund.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.760]   - And Bill, when you said about TIPS
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.040]   are for people who are older,
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.840]   would you not use them in a portfolio
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.760]   during the accumulation years?
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   - Yes, I would, or no, I would not use them
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.200]   in the accumulation phase for that simple reason
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.440]   that the expected return of stocks
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.640]   is higher than that of TIPS.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.820]   And if you have a 20, 30, 40, 50-year horizon,
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.320]   you don't need them in your portfolio.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.000]   When you need them in your portfolio
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.400]   is when you are much older and you are accumulating
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.100]   and you do not wish to take the risk
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.000]   of significant inflation,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.080]   which is a near constant in economic history.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.800]   - But so in the accumulation years,
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.200]   if some, for the part of a portfolio
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.680]   that is not in equities,
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.860]   where would you suggest it be?
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.200]   - Well, in the first place,
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.160]   if you're in the accumulation part of your portfolio,
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.820]   you should be very stock-heavy.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.480]   As Carolyn explained, if you're 40 years old,
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.700]   you really should have,
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.000]   you're not gonna be retiring for another 20 or 30 years.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.080]   You should have very little in the way of bonds
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.940]   in your portfolio.
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.920]   You don't need that money for 20 or 30 years.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.640]   Why would you invest it in a low-yielding asset?
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.520]   Now, there is a good reason for doing it,
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.080]   which is the psychological aspect of it.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.280]   So the question is, where do you put your money
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.040]   if not in TIPS?
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.440]   TIPS aren't a bad place to put them,
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.360]   but treasury bills aren't a bad place to put them either.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.640]   The last report, Berkshire Hathaway,
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.200]   Mr. Buffett had 30% of his assets in treasury bills.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.560]   He's not a stupid man.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.680]   - So in our portfolios for 25 years,
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:37.320]   in the fixed-income portion, in a tax-deferred account,
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:42.040]   we've been 50% intermediate bonds, governments,
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.440]   30% short-term governments, and 20% in TIPS.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.400]   And that's never changed again
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.360]   because that's there just to protect against the downside
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.640]   because many of us, I'm in the period of accumulation,
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.600]   by the way, I hope we all are.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.440]   (audience laughs)
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.960]   And so, but I still have a limit
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.720]   as to how much I'm willing to lose.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.240]   So those bonds are there for no other reason,
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.960]   and that's why they're governments,
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.480]   because they're the most defensive thing that I know to do
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.080]   to keep the losses that I will sustain
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.200]   when it all comes apart to the limit
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.680]   that my wife and I have.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.320]   And so it's been the same for many, many years.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.920]   - I wanna say something to all this.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.200]   It's like everybody's different.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.520]   I have 40-year-olds.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.840]   I even have 30-year-olds that have plenty of money.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.920]   They know their number.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.680]   They know what they need for financial independence,
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.640]   and they love their bonds.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.840]   They don't care about growing a gazillion dollars
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.480]   'cause they're financially independent,
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.880]   and given what they're doing now.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.600]   And so that's why the important part
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.560]   of maintaining financial independence
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.040]   because you can't predict your life
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.440]   is knowing what it is you need to spend going forward.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.880]   And the most important part of a financial plan
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.440]   that I don't see hardly anybody doing
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.160]   is you need to revisit spending
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.880]   and redo projections based on spending every year,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.880]   and your portfolio allocation should be based on that,
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.640]   not whether you're trying to make the most money
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.960]   and trying to figure out what the market's gonna do
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.720]   for the next 20 or 30 years.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:30.240]   - Earlier this month, the Fed cut rates
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.440]   for the first time in over four years.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.880]   The consensus is more rate cuts are ahead.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.200]   Does that change your thinking
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.000]   about any of your investments or your allocations?
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.520]   - Yeah, I wanna say something to that first.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:47.520]   So we have, our firm is an ensemble,
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.960]   and so we all are specializing in something,
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.640]   and I actually have an investment manager,
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.280]   so I'm embarrassed to say I'm not our investment specialist
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.040]   in our firm, but we all know everything going on, right?
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.960]   And so my investment manager, this wonder kid of age 26,
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:06.080]   he shows this great chart of how interest rates go up,
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.360]   kind of a little slow, and then when they start cutting,
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.040]   they cut like this, and then you get flat up,
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.320]   and then maybe a little peak, and then flat.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.800]   And so I remember, since I'm old,
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.480]   I remember in 2006, '07,
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.240]   that interest rates were pretty decent,
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.880]   and we were buying a lot of,
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.720]   then the wonder kid was not born yet.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.920]   I had a different investment manager at that point.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:33.160]   But same philosophy, the young kid learned
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.680]   from the older guy.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.280]   We just loaded up on bonds, and individual bonds
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.440]   that were going out 2015, 2016.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.280]   So when the market dropped in 2009,
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.920]   interest rates went, choo, clients loved us.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.320]   And so we did the same thing this time.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.920]   Soon as those interest rates went up,
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.760]   we said to clients, now's the time,
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.840]   let's take as much cash off the table,
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.480]   'cause everybody loves cash, 'cause if it's paying 5%,
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.880]   I'm like, rates are gonna drop.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.440]   We show 'em that beautiful chart that said,
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.780]   ooh, put more in bonds, put more in bonds,
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.540]   and that's what we did.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.600]   - The Fed tells us what they are planning on doing
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.320]   with the Fed funds rate, which is the overnight rate.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.240]   It's not even one day.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.480]   The top economists, as measured by the Wall Street Journal,
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.200]   have called the direction, up or down,
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.160]   on the 10-year Treasury, correct,
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.320]   about 40% of the time, less than a coin flip.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.320]   So the only thing it changes is perhaps when to go,
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.240]   I'm a believer now that it's okay
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.320]   to have some short-term bonds,
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.800]   but when total bonds start yielding,
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.040]   let's say, a percentage point more than the short-term,
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.560]   then you're being compensated
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.440]   for taking on a bit more interest rate risk.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.360]   Always keep credit quality high.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.400]   The Total Bond Fund follows
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.760]   the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index,
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.400]   which used to be the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.920]   I mentioned that yesterday.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.100]   - One of my touchstones is the famous
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.440]   Bernard Baruch statement,
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.680]   it's something that everyone knows isn't worth knowing.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.720]   And so almost immediately when I hear
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.320]   the terms Federal Reserve,
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.960]   my brain immediately shuts down and I stop listening.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.960]   - I haven't made any changes and don't recommend it.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.800]   Did the Fed cut a half, so what are we at,
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   four and a half now on, say, a three-month T-bill, roughly?
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.840]   Well, that's a good rate.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.960]   I mean, so if you've got Treasury bills
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.920]   and part of your allocation is just to roll Treasury bills,
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.200]   I mean, there's no change there.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.920]   If you're, the Fed is starting to cut,
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.320]   so I mean, usually that's good for the equity market,
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.140]   so there's no change there.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.960]   You know, the Fed cut,
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.160]   but the intermediate and long-term rates
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.920]   kind of stayed the same, didn't do anything,
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.920]   so there's no change there, so no change.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.080]   - Okay, no change.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.320]   - One more thing, as Carolyn touched on,
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.120]   you know, the joy of owning a long bond
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.200]   when there's a market crash.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.240]   But there are two kinds of market crashes, okay?
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.640]   There's the financial panic one,
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.880]   where the financial system shuts down
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.360]   and there, Treasuries are golden.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.480]   The asset that you want to own is the long bond, okay?
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.800]   But there's another kind of market crash,
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.600]   which occurs when the Fed tightens dramatically,
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.160]   and then bonds go down,
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.600]   and so you may not want to own the long bond.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.580]   The long bond was not a particularly good asset
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.320]   to own in the year 2022.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.480]   - I want to clarify, though,
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.240]   that we hold all bonds to maturity.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.940]   We don't trade bonds, so.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.240]   - Wanted to ask a question about another thing
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.560]   that is going on in the world beyond us.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.440]   We're now less than six weeks to a presidential election.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.880]   Without saying anything about your politics
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.320]   or the individual candidates,
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.100]   does the upcoming election affect any of your thinking
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.760]   or things you were doing as investors?
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.960]   - Just, I think it has a lot to do,
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.300]   perhaps, when we find out who wins,
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.660]   you may make some shifts to your estate planning,
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.880]   depending on what happens with the sunset of the,
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.520]   we know this is law already, right?
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.120]   The sunset of the Trump tax cuts,
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.000]   they're gonna go away in 2026,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.920]   and that could affect your estate planning,
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.880]   and you may have to do some new estate planning.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.560]   Other than that, I don't think so.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.740]   - Tax law changes, as you mentioned, Rick,
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.360]   could certainly cause some changes in the financial plan,
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.400]   but I won't know anything the rest of the market
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.480]   doesn't already know after the election,
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.040]   so I will not change a thing,
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.780]   and I've written pieces ad nauseum.
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.000]   Don't do anything based on,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.900]   you don't like the candidate that won.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.880]   - I love this question, by the way,
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.160]   'cause we have clients from all across
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.880]   the political spectrum,
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.320]   and they'll call when they're worried
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.180]   about the potential candidates gonna be elected
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.540]   from both sides,
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.820]   and we actually have this newsletter
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.140]   that we wrote a long time ago,
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.140]   'cause if you look at all the studies,
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.460]   basically elections don't affect the markets,
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:17.460]   and we take that same exact newsletter every four years,
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.780]   and we just put new lipstick on the pig,
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.200]   and we send that newsletter out again every time.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.980]   - And I do think that one of the most important jobs
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:32.300]   of an investment advisor is to be there
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.880]   to talk them through that decision.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.420]   John was about my age, I think,
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.660]   when I was a younger advisor,
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.540]   and Clinton had been elected,
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.780]   and he called up and said, "Sell everything.
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.100]   "I do not wanna be in the market
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.780]   "with Clinton as the president."
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:57.360]   And I talked for 45 minutes, and I won,
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.460]   and it wasn't that I was voting or cheering
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.220]   for who the president might be,
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.980]   but that I didn't want people to use that
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.200]   as a market timing tool,
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.360]   and if you do, there's no evidence that it works.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.620]   - Yeah, I mean, it's a truism that you tell your kids,
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.740]   and what your mama told you,
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.540]   is don't discuss religion or politics with strangers,
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.460]   but it shouldn't have anything to do
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.900]   with the way you manage your portfolio,
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.240]   not a single thing, neither religion nor politics.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.360]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.680]   Changing gears a little bit,
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.700]   over the past few years, many bogal heads
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:39.400]   have been dismayed by the quality of service at Vanguard.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.920]   Should investors who have been loyal users
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.960]   of Vanguard funds consider buying those funds
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:50.880]   or other funds on platforms other than Vanguard?
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.240]   - Yeah, I want Alan to answer that,
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.480]   'cause he wrote an excellent article on that.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.340]   You know, I'm not gonna make any excuses.
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.500]   Vanguard service has really gone down,
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.260]   and I still have a flagship advisor,
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.420]   so I can imagine how hard it is for a lot of people.
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.100]   You know, I can say I'm encouraged.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:13.500]   I sent a blind email to Salim Ramji, the new CEO.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.820]   He responded kind of like, just like Jack Bogle,
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.100]   and I wrote, I asked him 10 questions
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.060]   in an article that I wrote about,
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.980]   and one thing that's not in the article,
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.820]   he's saying all the right things,
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.360]   but one thing that's not in the article,
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:34.080]   Michael Nolan, Jack Bogle's last number two
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.160]   and fiercely loyal, the video,
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.320]   or the interview was conducted in a video,
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.580]   and Mike was smiling the whole time.
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.400]   It was as if Jack Bogle was looking down
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.220]   and listening to his answers, so I'm really encouraged,
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.560]   but it's not gonna be an easy task
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.920]   to fix things at a company that size,
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.920]   but I think they are making progress,
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.360]   and I'm really encouraged.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:04.840]   - A lot of people are moving their assets out of Vanguard
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:09.160]   and moving them to, say, Fidelity.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.760]   A lot of people moving to Fidelity, which is fine.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.920]   Fidelity's a good firm.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.560]   They have great service, but I have to warn you,
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.360]   when you do that, you are going to be asked
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.600]   to meet with a Fidelity financial representative.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.760]   I hasten to call them financial advisors
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.320]   because their only advice is going to be
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.240]   sell whatever you got at Vanguard
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.840]   and get into our separately managed account program.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.140]   I had a client, a couple of weeks ago,
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:45.080]   moved 15 million from Vanguard over to Fidelity.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.680]   I had a $5 million position in VTI,
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.880]   the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF,
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.460]   in a taxable trust account
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:57.040]   that had over a $2 million unrealized gain,
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.760]   and the recommendation of the Fidelity advisor
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.480]   was you're under-diversified.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.160]   You need to sell this position
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.920]   and put your money in a separately managed account.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.000]   I mean--
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.600]   - Yeah, I have a small rolling treasury ladder at Fidelity,
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.840]   which they will do.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.400]   It's a wonderful service, and once a month,
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.040]   I get a little email from them telling me
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.640]   that my portfolio is horribly under-diversified.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:28.040]   The alternative, in terms of big custodians, is Schwab,
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.000]   and they're fine, too.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.960]   You're not gonna be harassed
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.680]   by their representatives as much,
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.240]   but you will spend the rest of your life
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.060]   policing their sweep vehicle, which yields 40 basis points.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:45.160]   - As investors, we are often looking for rules of thumb,
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.360]   guidelines for what we do.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.240]   In my conversations getting ready for this panel,
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.680]   I thought it was interesting
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.960]   that both Paul Merriman and Alan Roth
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.580]   said that there are a lot of situations
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.180]   where half this, half that
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.240]   can be a really useful bit of guidance.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.200]   So I'm gonna ask you, Paul,
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.460]   can you start us off by telling us about your 50/50s?
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:14.580]   - I am 50/50 buy and hold and market timing.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.540]   I am, and I am 50/50 US and international.
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:25.360]   And I'm 50/50 basically growth and value.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.280]   So you add all those 50s up,
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.080]   and I don't know how much more diversified I could be.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.520]   And by the way, I was, at a point in my career,
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.920]   very knowledgeable about market timing.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.320]   And I concluded it is not something
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.880]   that the individual person should ever try to do,
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.200]   which is why I don't do it.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.780]   And even though I was an investment advisor in my retirement,
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.760]   the last thing I wanna worry about is our money.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.760]   So I have an investment advisor
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.700]   to make sure that everything gets done,
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.680]   because my emotions are such,
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:11.000]   when the market starts down, I get very protective.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.920]   And I've learned to keep my hands off.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.800]   After all, I am 50/50.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   - So my question for you, what is your goal for your money?
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.680]   - Well, my first goal is to make sure
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.840]   that Western Washington University gets enough money
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:30.840]   to educate their students on financial literacy.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.680]   That's my first goal.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.760]   My second goal is, we already have it set up
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.200]   so that my wife will be okay.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.160]   I did what I advocate to everybody that can do it.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.200]   I over-saved.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.200]   I did not retire until I had way more than I really needed.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:54.480]   So my goal is for it to grow, but not too fast,
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.780]   because I don't like the risk if it grows too fast.
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.640]   But I also would like to see it grow a moderate amount.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:06.640]   So if I got a 6% or 7% return over the years, I'd be fine.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:12.160]   - In the words of that great financial authority,
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.600]   Yogi Berra, 50% of this game is 90% mental.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.360]   And splitting the difference when you have
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.800]   the big decision to make, 50/50 one way or the other,
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.480]   is generally a good way of accomplishing
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.960]   the main psychological chore which you have,
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.360]   which is minimizing regret.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.120]   - Alan, tell us about some of your 50/50s.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.800]   - Harry Markowitz, the father of modern portfolio theory,
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.160]   who does all these calculations to determine
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.280]   the optimal efficient portfolio,
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.080]   was once asked, "What's your portfolio allocation?"
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.320]   And he said, "50%," to minimize regret.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:52.500]   There are other reasons.
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.320]   If you look at Morningstar's safe spin rates,
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.760]   it tends to maximize somewhere around 50% bonds,
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.960]   50% stocks.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:06.440]   You get more of a boost from rebalancing at 50%.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:10.080]   Paul, my portfolio was also at 50%.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.360]   Other things, like if a client has,
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.600]   let's say is an officer of a company,
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.480]   and they've got 80% of their net worth
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.380]   in their company's stock,
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.920]   oftentimes we say let's sell half over the next year or two.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.120]   If it goes up, they can be happy that they had it
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.800]   and blame Alan Roth for selling it.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.760]   If it goes down, they can pat themselves on the back.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.720]   Dollar cost averaging.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.080]   If you inherit a lot of money, you sell your company.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.840]   I think a couple years ago, the panel was asked,
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.520]   do you dollar cost average or put it all in immediately?
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.880]   And mathematically, you put it all in immediately,
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.640]   but we're emotional animals,
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.480]   we're not logical, rational animals,
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.360]   so often selling half, obviously the shares
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.700]   that have the highest cost basis.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.600]   And then traditional versus Roth?
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.780]   My answer is yes.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.360]   We do not know what tax laws are going to be.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:10.680]   We know that our income is gonna go down in retirement,
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.300]   but we don't know what tax laws will be.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.840]   Logic says with our debt and deficit,
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.800]   taxes have to go up, but logic and politics
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.760]   really don't have much in common.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.360]   - Let me put in a pitch here now.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.680]   If you have questions, please write them down.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.680]   If you have a question waiting to be collected,
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.960]   please raise your hand.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.960]   We have a couple of people coming around
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.260]   to collect your questions,
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.520]   'cause we'll try and get to those quite soon.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:44.120]   Wanted to talk briefly about international stocks.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.760]   This year has been another one
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.920]   where international stocks are trailing
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.080]   far behind US stocks.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.040]   The Vanguard Total International Stock Index
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:58.040]   is up 14%, Total US Index Fund up 20.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.240]   Looking over the past 15 years on an annualized basis,
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:08.240]   US beats international 14% to 6%.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.320]   Jack Bogle was famously unconvinced
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.960]   that one needed to own international stocks,
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.880]   although Victor made some really interesting points
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.580]   about the valuation impact on that decision.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.440]   So I'm wondering what your thinking is
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.560]   on should I own international stocks?
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.240]   - Yeah, I think the point that Victor made this morning
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.080]   was quite an incisive one,
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.200]   that you're basically buying a large part
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.320]   of the US economy at a discount
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.960]   when you buy international stocks.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.760]   But the other way to look at it
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:45.760]   is to say that the PE, by whatever measure you want,
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:50.260]   of international stocks is half that of US stocks.
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.320]   So what you're saying is that the US per share growth
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:58.760]   in earnings is going to grow over the foreseeable future
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:02.560]   twice as fast as those of international companies will,
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.120]   and I think that's a very strong assumption.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.560]   Eventually you'll be happy
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.600]   you bought international stocks, just not yet.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:19.600]   - Okay, so why are international stocks
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.900]   not doing as well as US stocks?
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.780]   And you really gotta look under the hood
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.100]   and see that, well, here in this country,
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.900]   in the United States, we are blessed with some very large,
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:35.260]   very successful, leading tech companies
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:39.020]   that are making a lot of money
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.220]   and that are not influenced by higher interest rates
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.940]   because they don't finance the balance sheet
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.480]   by borrowing money.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.380]   So we're in a great spot.
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.360]   I just think about, by the way,
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.360]   thank you for telling me what international stocks
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.200]   versus US stocks have done and small cap,
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.880]   'cause I don't really know, so I appreciate that.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.080]   So international stocks apparently
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.560]   have underperformed again this year, I guess.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:06.760]   But international stocks are in different industry groups.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.820]   If you look at what underlines what's out there
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.960]   outside the US, we're talking about a lot
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:16.700]   of industrial stocks, material stocks, energy stocks,
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.200]   things like mining companies.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.480]   I mean, it's almost like what the S&P looked like
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.360]   50 years ago here in the United States.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.640]   That's what it looks like overseas.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.240]   We buy a lot of that stuff, by the way,
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.120]   that they make and they mine, so we buy that.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.440]   We're consumers of that.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.480]   In the long term, if you have about 30% to 40%
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.960]   in international, it is a good diversification benefit.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.840]   You get individual stock diversification.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.380]   You're now getting a lot of industry diversification,
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.500]   and you're getting currency diversification.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.040]   Again, we've been blessed in this country
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.220]   with the US dollar being strong.
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:57.260]   It's not always that way, so my opinion
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.300]   is you should have about, to make it simple,
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.660]   and I like to keep things simple,
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.340]   2/3 in the US, 1/3 in international,
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.260]   using total stock market US,
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.220]   total stock market international
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.300]   is a very good allocation to hold for the long term.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.900]   And by the way, the one thing about international,
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.560]   which is interesting, the dividend yield
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.840]   on that now is over 3%, so now I'm telling people,
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.320]   well, if you're in a high tax bracket,
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.440]   you might wanna think about putting your international
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.920]   in your tax-deferred or tax-free account
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.500]   because the dividend yield is so high.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.400]   - Jack Bogle has been right, even since his passing,
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.160]   and I am the most argumentative person in the world,
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.300]   although I completely agree with Rick on this point.
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.300]   I don't only buy Colorado stocks.
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:41.080]   You shouldn't only buy stocks in your state.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:45.460]   Diversification is very important,
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.760]   and the next magnificent seven or 17 or whatever
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.700]   might be international stock.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:54.460]   And don't forget, they have some wars going on.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.100]   And hopefully that will get resolved
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.780]   and is part of the reason why international
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.100]   has performed so poorly.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.780]   - Okay, thank you, let's move on.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.620]   - You know, one thing, by the way,
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:06.340]   we got a 6% return over the last 15 years.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.500]   I mean, if you think about it,
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.400]   the expected return from equity
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:14.200]   is only maybe 4% over the risk-free rate, okay?
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.160]   And assuming that the natural risk-free rate out there
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:21.440]   is 3%, that would make the return of stock about 7%.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.360]   We've only been 1% below that.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.920]   What's dwarfing this whole thing
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.280]   is the great return of U.S. stocks.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.800]   So it really hasn't been bad for international,
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.760]   it's just that U.S. looks so great relative to it.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.560]   - Good point, okay, we're gonna move on
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.900]   to some audience questions.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.340]   Is there a reason to buy actively managed bond funds
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.860]   instead of just a bond index fund?
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:48.020]   I've been told since bond rates are somewhat predictable,
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.620]   active management is better.
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.800]   - No.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.700]   - Yes, but only if you're selling them
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.020]   and you can make a lot of money, but absolutely not.
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:03.860]   - Well, the Vanguard Municipal Bond Funds,
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.020]   not their new index funds,
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.500]   but their municipal bond funds are actively managed.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.260]   Though, as I say, they look more
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.300]   like a municipal bond index fund
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.500]   because they have more holdings
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.260]   than most municipal bond index funds.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.260]   But so, no, you don't need active management.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:24.220]   - Yeah, I'm a Tobin separation theorem fundamentalist,
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.740]   which means that you have risky assets on one side
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.460]   and riskless assets on the other side.
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.660]   And so, the only bonds that I wanna own
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.860]   are U.S. treasuries, thank you.
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.260]   If I wanna take credit risk, I'll buy stocks
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.580]   'cause that's where you're getting the credit premium from.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:45.300]   It's basically an equity premium that you're taking.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.940]   And so, there's no need to buy a fund
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.100]   if you're just buying U.S. treasuries.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.340]   Just buy treasuries at auction.
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.700]   You don't even have to pay Vanguard
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.980]   three or four basis points of expense ratio.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:55.820]   Why do it?
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:59.680]   - Another question, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.060]   have been cited a number of times.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.740]   What are your thoughts about including Berkshire Hathaway
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.940]   in a portfolio?
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.140]   - No.
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:14.580]   - It's a very low cost mutual fund type.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.260]   It's not a mutual fund, but it's a type of thing.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.320]   Typically, if somebody has it and they have a gain,
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.340]   I'm not gonna sell it, but I don't recommend
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.460]   owning it outside of my total stock index fund.
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:28.660]   - You get this a lot when people do not want income
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.820]   in their taxable portfolio.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:31.900]   They don't even want a dividend,
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.020]   even the 1.5% or so dividend
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.420]   that the U.S. stock market is paying.
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.140]   They don't even want that.
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.180]   So, they say, "Well, what if I just bought
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.420]   "all Berkshire Hathaway?"
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.380]   And I can't agree with that.
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.500]   I think you're better off buying a total stock market
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.000]   and paying the tax on the 1.5% dividend.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.020]   - A question, we talk a lot about stocks,
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.980]   bonds, international stocks.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.620]   Do you believe that real estate or REITs
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.980]   or real estate ETFs should have a place
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.820]   in a diversified portfolio?
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:06.740]   - You own REITs within a total stock index fund.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:11.740]   With that said, the vast majority of commercial real estate
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.100]   is not in public markets.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:19.540]   So, I certainly believe that you can put some
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.680]   of the Vanguard REIT index fund in there,
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.460]   but you've gotta stick with it.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:28.300]   And the correlations with stocks are low,
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.300]   but that's not negative.
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.340]   Negative means they typically move in opposite directions.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.260]   So, I think there is some reason
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:39.140]   to have a little bit of a ultra-low-cost REIT index fund.
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:42.780]   - The most popular piece we ever wrote
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.700]   was entitled "The Ultimate Buy and Hold Strategy."
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:50.500]   And there wasn't really anything ultimate about it,
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.840]   but people would read it.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.220]   What it did say is that here are 10
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.780]   different equity asset classes.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:03.740]   And by the way, we still update this article every year.
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:07.180]   And those 10 equity asset classes are large-cap blend,
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.720]   large-cap value, small-cap blend, small-cap value,
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:14.700]   international small-cap blend and small-cap value,
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:18.580]   international large-cap blend and large-cap value,
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.420]   and REITs.
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.340]   And if you build a portfolio,
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:28.340]   10% in each of those great equity asset classes,
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:33.420]   it has historically, in the past, worked out quite well
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:38.720]   and produced a very nice unit of return per unit of risk.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:44.560]   So, I do believe that in a tax-deferred or tax-free account,
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.940]   REITs would be a legitimate thing to own.
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:51.540]   For us, we, you notice I didn't say no at the beginning.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:55.100]   So, we do own about, for portfolios,
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:59.540]   about 5% REITs in clients tax-deferred
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.940]   or tax-free accounts, usually tax-deferred.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:03.780]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:05.780]   You should only own them in a tax-deferred account.
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.680]   They have, REITs have had historically very high returns.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.620]   And I believe that one of the reasons for that
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.980]   is because the federal law mandates
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:18.860]   they have to pay out 90% of their earnings in dividends.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.700]   And unfortunately, large industrial corporations
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.580]   and technology firms have an alarming tendency
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:27.540]   of wasting internally-generated capital
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.660]   on less-than-optimal projects.
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:33.780]   And so, federal law saves REITs from doing that.
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.740]   And that's one of the reasons why the returns are so good.
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.020]   So, I think that over-weighting them
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.720]   is probably not a bad idea.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.580]   - So, I wrote a piece for Forbes,
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.180]   I don't know how long ago it was,
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:49.180]   maybe 15 years ago, called The Total Economy Portfolio.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.300]   So, allocating your equity allocation
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:56.260]   a little bit more to what the economy is
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.960]   rather than what the stock market is.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.460]   Because we can't make a decision
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.220]   whether a company's gonna capitalize themselves
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:06.340]   privately or with debt or by going public
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:07.440]   in the stock market.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.340]   So, there are certain industry groups out there
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:15.020]   that have very small amount of allocation
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.220]   to the stock market, like real estate,
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.760]   but they're a huge part of the economy,
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.500]   well over 10% of the economy is commercial real estate
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.200]   when you look at national income.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.460]   So, if you wanted your portfolio
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.300]   to look more like the economy
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.020]   rather than the stock market,
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:33.100]   then you could put maybe 10% of your equity allocation
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.300]   could go to real estate.
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.060]   And that nudges the portfolio
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:40.380]   more towards what the economy looks like.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:43.220]   And I'll add to that, Paul will like this,
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:47.540]   that small cap value mirrors private equity
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:51.580]   as far as the return and risk in many ways.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.420]   So, if you wanted to include private equity
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:55.540]   in your portfolio,
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.500]   you don't need to go out and buy private equity funds,
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:01.180]   you could buy a small cap value index fund.
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.660]   And that, again, looks more like the economy
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.180]   than it does the stock market.
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.740]   Now, is all this necessary?
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:11.740]   No, not really, but it makes for a good story for Forbes.
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.340]   (panelists laughing)
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.180]   They liked it.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.740]   - You were doing so well, Rick.
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:18.060]   (panelists laughing)
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:20.740]   - So, you can, if you want to add real estate, that's fine.
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.980]   If you don't, that's fine too.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.940]   - If someone calls you up
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.500]   with a private real estate deal, hang up.
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.420]   (panelists laughing)
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.180]   - A different kind of question.
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.300]   As the deficit grows,
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:36.380]   do you think the government could change laws
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.020]   to tax Roth IRAs?
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.580]   Should I be worried about that?
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:42.460]   - I'm gonna, I wanna grab this one before all the guys do.
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.100]   So, first off, you have to remember
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.340]   the government is not a household
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.820]   and that deficits, if you don't have,
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.860]   whoa, this is getting bad.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.780]   Should everybody turn theirs off and yeah,
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.340]   maybe that'll help, yeah.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.780]   So, deficits do matter
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.140]   because you have to worry about inflation,
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:03.300]   but the government, year to year,
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.580]   can change how they deal with the deficits.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:10.580]   We don't ever have to totally pay back the whole deficit
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:13.260]   and in fact, that would create austerity.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:17.500]   So, you know, you can't predict the future of taxes.
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.300]   I do think tax rates will go up at some point
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.660]   because we're at the lowest tax rates ever.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:26.460]   We have great discrepancy in income inequality
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.660]   compared to a long time,
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.620]   which tends to cause social unrest.
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:32.140]   That's the reason taxes need to go up.
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:33.660]   So, it will happen.
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.540]   Will they make Roths?
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:39.220]   So, the question was, will they start taxing Roths?
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.780]   I, you know, that's political suicide.
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.460]   So, I don't think they're gonna go back on what's been done.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:47.180]   They just usually, whenever,
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.020]   and I worked in Washington, guys,
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:51.940]   so I know a lot of how Washington works
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:53.540]   and how their brains think.
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.460]   And so, what's gonna happen
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:58.380]   is they will change the rules going forward
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:45:59.660]   for the most part.
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:01.340]   And I know everybody on this panel
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:02.580]   is gonna say something different
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.860]   because I'm a contrarian on tax and economic policy.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.220]   - Yeah, I'm gonna tell you all
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:12.700]   how the government financed its massive deficit
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.380]   for the stimulus package,
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.580]   various stimulus packages they had
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.940]   during the COVID epidemic.
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:21.340]   And the way they did it was by inflating away
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.620]   the value of your dollars.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.660]   You were getting 0% on treasuries.
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:29.620]   Prices went up by 20% over a three-year period.
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.340]   And that's how the government paid for that deficit
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.380]   was they just inflated it away.
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:36.420]   - They printed the money.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.260]   - When I started investing-- - That's okay.
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.660]   - Sorry. - Sorry.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.620]   - When I started investing in 1963
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.060]   and then I became a stockbroker in '66,
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.260]   but in that period,
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.860]   marginal tax rates were 90%
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.820]   and then dropped down to 70%.
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.940]   And it seemed like people went to work
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.780]   as people go to work today
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.700]   trying to do the best that they could.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:05.500]   And the bottom line is I tell young people today,
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.140]   get all the money you can into a Roth.
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:11.060]   We have no idea what future tax rates are going to be,
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:16.020]   but my gut tells me they could be 70% again.
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:20.100]   I mean, I know it's hard to believe that, but they could.
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.660]   And I think it makes sense to try
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:26.420]   to get that money set aside and protect it.
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:28.860]   It'll be worth the price of admission,
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.940]   certainly if I'm right.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.540]   - Okay, I think we're gonna squeeze in one last question
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:34.980]   and then we're gonna wrap up.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:40.140]   As more and more money is in index funds,
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:43.260]   does that mean that there's a very small percentage
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.180]   of the investors out there
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:49.340]   who are actually determining the value of securities?
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.260]   Should we be concerned about that?
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.140]   - No, absolutely not.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.420]   The whole thing is absurd.
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:57.220]   It's really a way for the active managers
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:01.300]   to try to say, "Hey, you need to invest with us
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.860]   "because indexing is bad.
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:04.060]   "Indexing is Marxism.
[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.860]   "Indexing is this, indexing is that."
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:09.780]   I mean, I've been hearing this since, what, 1976
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:12.060]   when indexes were first formed, right?
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.180]   Bogle's Folly, Bogle's Folly, right?
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.020]   The whole thing.
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:17.820]   I've been hearing this now for, what, almost 50 years.
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:20.860]   So the answer is no, we don't have to worry about that.
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:25.140]   - If 90% of the market of stocks are indexed
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.700]   because active managers trade 10 times as much
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.460]   as passive managers do,
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.780]   that still means that 50% of price discovery
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.140]   is going to be done by active managers.
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:36.420]   That's plenty.
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.300]   - Okay, listen, I'm gonna say thank you
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.940]   to our amazing panel.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:43.100]   (audience applauding)
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.820]   And thank you to the audience
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:50.500]   for some really excellent questions as well.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:53.660]   (audience applauding)
