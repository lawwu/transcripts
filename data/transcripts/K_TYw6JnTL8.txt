[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]   It was never about getting rich,
[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.520]   never about being a billionaire or anything like that.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.840]   I wanted to pursue financial independence for one,
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.760]   two reasons, two reasons.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.280]   And I think both of these will resonate with you.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.200]   Number one, when I was growing up,
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.000]   my dad worked really hard,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.240]   but he wasn't there much 'cause he worked all the time.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.720]   And so I rarely saw him.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.320]   And I said, when I am a father someday,
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.360]   I wanna be there for every ball game,
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.320]   every ballet recital, every field trip.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.640]   I wanna be there with my kids.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.840]   I wanna be the best father I can possibly be.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.840]   And I can't work 40, 50, 60 hours a week
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.560]   and have commuting to be able to do that.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.120]   So I started with that, and that was the one thing.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.680]   The second thing I said,
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.600]   I heard a quote once that said,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.000]   "The world is a book,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.640]   "and those who don't travel read just a page."
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.480]   Like the world is so amazing, right?
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.320]   So big, and there's so many things to see out there.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.660]   And I wanted to see as much of it as I can
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.640]   while we're here on this earth.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.800]   And I knew that, again, being broke
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.120]   and working 40, 50 hours a week
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.400]   and getting my two weeks paid vacation every year,
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.280]   that wasn't gonna cut it.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.680]   So combining those two things,
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.560]   that's why I pursued real estate and business
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.280]   and wealth in general.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.120]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "All The Hacks,"
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.040]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.560]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.040]   to optimize life, to maximize happiness,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.340]   and to do it all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.240]   So today, I'm sharing the second half
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.640]   of my conversation with Brandon Turner.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.800]   If you didn't listen two weeks ago,
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.640]   Brandon had an incredible career in real estate,
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.520]   and that episode covered so many
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.280]   different aspects of the topic.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.800]   Well, not unsurprisingly,
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.360]   successful people often have more than one area
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.880]   in their life that you can learn a lot from.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.120]   And after we finished up the real estate conversation,
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.400]   we covered everything from setting goals
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.820]   to hacking self-discipline, using performance coaches,
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.400]   finding the balance between audacious business goals
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.880]   and quality family time, and the mindset Brandon uses
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.440]   to build massive real estate empires
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.940]   while also living an ideal life.
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.640]   Oh, and since he lives in Maui,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.760]   I got all his recommendations for your next trip there,
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.240]   some of which I actually took
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.400]   on the trip we just got back from.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.760]   So let's get into the rest of my conversation
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.000]   with Brandon Turner.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.760]   Brandon, welcome back.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.400]   I wanna dive right into mindset and systems
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.880]   because you've talked about that in our last conversation.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.120]   You've talked about it a lot in the past.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.680]   What are most people getting wrong
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.120]   when it comes to their mindset
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.640]   and the systems they put around it?
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.480]   - This might not be true for this audience, right?
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.160]   'Cause if you're listening to this show,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.640]   like you're probably already a pretty high achiever.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.760]   You've got goals, you've got things you wanna do in life.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.060]   But I'll say that most people live life in the backseat.
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.840]   Like they're being driven around
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.480]   in this crazy taxi around the world,
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.920]   and they're just doing whatever comes at them, right?
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.400]   They're not taking any control.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.240]   So I would say 90% of the world is that way.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.760]   They have no mindset
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.880]   because they don't even know that's a thing.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.800]   They don't know that there's a thing
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.200]   they should be concerned about, right?
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.520]   Like they work the same job, they hate,
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.080]   and they're miserable for 50 years,
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.120]   and they just look forward to the weekends
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.520]   where they can drink with their buddies
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.720]   because that's just what life is.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.240]   So assuming that these people are not that type,
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.080]   what are they getting?
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.240]   I mean, it's really just, and it's related, right?
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.060]   It's knowing that anything is possible.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.600]   Anything is possible.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.200]   It's like your mom said when you were a little kid, right?
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.760]   You can do anything if you try.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.960]   Like it's totally true, right?
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.920]   You can do anything.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.280]   You can make millions in real estate.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.320]   You could build a tech company.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.840]   You could be a digital nomad
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.440]   and live on points and 500 bucks a month or whatever.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.300]   Like you could do whatever you want.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.800]   So I'm a big believer of like,
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.880]   start with the feeling you wanna have.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.720]   Like start with a feeling of life you wanna have.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.000]   Define your ideal day.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.360]   Like I love that practice where you're just like,
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.840]   what does the ideal perfect day look like?
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.560]   And then jot that down,
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.140]   and now you know where you're headed.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.660]   Now you can find the strategy that's gonna get you there.
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.300]   But the mindset of this like,
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.060]   I want an ideal life and an ideal life is possible for me.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.260]   So I'm going to pursue it with every ounce of my being.
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.220]   And almost everybody I know who is incredibly happy in life
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.260]   and incredibly successful, not just from money,
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.100]   but from anything, right?
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.620]   People I know who have an amazing marriage,
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.660]   it's because they know that having an amazing marriage
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.700]   is possible and they work for it.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.780]   And they fight for it because they know it's possible.
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.300]   And so that's the thing I think a lot of people
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.160]   in general miss, is they just,
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.120]   they never take time to envision what's possible.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.400]   And they just do whatever's in front of them.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.900]   - I'm gonna assume you're one of those people
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.000]   that wants an amazing marriage.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.520]   Can you tell me about, you know,
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.060]   things that you've done intentionally to make that possible?
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.160]   - Yeah, man.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.720]   So I set goals every year.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.760]   This is one of those life-changing things I ever did.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.160]   My wife and I, every year on the first or maybe the second,
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.640]   whenever we get a babysitter,
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.560]   we will go out and spend like half a day,
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.480]   or maybe even a full day,
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.600]   doing our couple's goal-setting retreat.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.940]   Now, in a perfect world, I'd go for like two or three days.
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.040]   We'd go on the vacation, you know,
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.220]   go to the mountains or whatever.
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.740]   And I got little kids at home.
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.820]   I got a two-year-old and a six-year-old.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.840]   So right now that's not happening,
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.460]   but we'll get out for a day.
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.180]   And we will just work together
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.060]   on where we wanna be as a couple.
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.100]   And that starts with a reflection on your past.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.600]   Like where were we last year?
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.440]   Where did we struggle?
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.560]   What are we doing right?
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.080]   What are we doing wrong?
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.620]   And then where do we wanna be?
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.220]   You know, so five years ago,
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.060]   we said within five years, we wanted a house in Hawaii.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.980]   We wanted a house where we could have people come and visit,
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.920]   family and friends to come and stay with us.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.500]   I said, I wanted to surf more.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.580]   I said, I wanted to, you know,
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.820]   I had all this stuff we wanted to do as a couple.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.940]   And it wasn't five years later.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.320]   We did it like nine months later.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.580]   'Cause as soon as we defined what was possible
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.620]   and we had a goal, all of a sudden it was like,
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.020]   well, hey, you wanna go to Hawaii for a couple months
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.580]   this winter while it's miserable and rainy
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.740]   in the Pacific Northwest?
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.100]   Sure, so we went there.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.000]   And because we knew we wanted to end up there someday,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.540]   we started looking at real estate
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.580]   and all of a sudden we found a house, right?
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.540]   Is that law of attraction?
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.660]   I mean, is that woo woo stuff?
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.060]   Or is that we had a vision for where we wanted to go
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.900]   and we worked towards it.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.100]   So we do that in our marriage.
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.760]   We set goals together every year.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.060]   We visit them every quarter.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.940]   I have a sheet hung up on my bathroom mirror
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.060]   that has our goals for the year,
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.860]   as well as spots for checking off.
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.600]   And I'm not very good at checking honestly with this.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.900]   I wish I checked it every single day,
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.460]   all like the habits that are gonna give us
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.420]   a better marriage, but we at least have it in the mirror
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.340]   every single day when I open up my toothbrush.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.420]   And so just being intentional,
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.060]   again, doing the things that we do in business
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.260]   and applying them to our personal life,
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.140]   that has made such a difference on the relationship side.
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.100]   - Do you do the same thing for other goals in life,
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.180]   whether it's business goals
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.760]   or your own personal non-relationship goals?
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.100]   - Yeah, yes, very similar.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.020]   So this is my framework and I didn't invent this.
[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.140]   I have a journal actually, is it back here somewhere, maybe?
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.980]   No, it's not, all right.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.940]   So I have a journal called "The Intention Journal"
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.700]   and I basically just got everybody journal in the world,
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.080]   every goal journal there was,
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.620]   and I used all of them for a while
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.280]   over the course of like three years,
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.180]   and then I just made my own.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.540]   But I'm not saying you have to get that one.
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.820]   I'm gonna give you a really simple system that I use.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.780]   So I have a vision for what my life to head, right?
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.020]   I have longer term goals.
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.980]   Like I'm trying to buy $10 billion of real estate
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.020]   in 10 years.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.180]   That's just so far out there though.
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.620]   So I don't like thinking in terms of decade goals,
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.620]   even though I might have them.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.580]   I don't like thinking in terms of even three-year goals,
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.660]   even though I have them.
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.140]   Even one-year goals, I don't love that much.
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.780]   It's just too far away.
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.460]   So what I like to do is I like to do quarterly
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.460]   or 90-day goals.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.780]   There's a great book out there called "The 12-Week Year"
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.940]   where I get a lot of this from.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.620]   "The 12-Week Year" by Brian Moran,
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.980]   I think is this guy's name.
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.640]   So the idea is like every quarter,
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.140]   I set three goals for myself.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.300]   I say, what are the three things
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.500]   this quarter I wanna do?
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.580]   Typically, it's one relational goal.
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.780]   Usually it's a fitness goal
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.780]   and usually it's a business goal.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.100]   And so, like for example, this quarter,
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.420]   one of my goals was simply to close
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.200]   the six apartment complexes we had under contract.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.040]   By the end of the quarter,
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.380]   I wanted to be able to close those
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.860]   and raise the money.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.900]   And there's a lot of things that go into that,
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.060]   but that's the idea.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.220]   So now I've got my three goals written out.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.460]   In fact, one of my goals for the last quarter of the year
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.720]   is gonna be to spend three days without the kids.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.620]   That's a weird goal, right?
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.980]   But that's the relationship one.
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.320]   I want, I've never,
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.460]   my wife and I have not had a night alone
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.760]   without the kids in six years.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.780]   Like since Rosie was born,
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.020]   we have not actually had a vacation
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.700]   where somebody watched Rosie, yeah.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.460]   And I'm like, this is a long time.
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.780]   Like, so now the kids,
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.700]   like the youngest is no longer breastfeeding.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.300]   Now he can, he's eating on his own.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.220]   He's a big kid now, two years old.
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.100]   Now we can do it.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.500]   So I have the goal for the quarter.
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.780]   Every Sunday night, every single Sunday night,
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.780]   and again, if I miss it, I'll do Monday morning.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.500]   I sit down and I rewrite what those three goals are.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.660]   I write what is the purpose for the goal.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.540]   I write that every week.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.580]   Why do I want that goal?
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.500]   It just reminds me,
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.260]   it gets me back into the right mentality of like,
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.940]   what am I doing all this for?
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.900]   Then I write down, what is my weekly goal?
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.140]   Like to be on track for my quarterly goal,
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:47.980]   what's the weekly goal?
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.860]   So I write that the weekly goal down.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.820]   Then I always write, what's my most important next step?
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.260]   Like the smallest tangible thing I can do
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.140]   to accomplish my weekly goal.
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.220]   So let's say my weekly goal is to hire a new assistant.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.840]   Okay, well, what's the most important next step on that?
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.680]   Well, I guess, yeah,
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.160]   I gotta put a job application out there.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.180]   Nope, not good enough.
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.780]   Well, go deeper.
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.180]   I need to open up my computer and write a job description.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.860]   Can I go even more specific?
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.100]   I need to go to Google
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.340]   and Google assistant job descriptions.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.180]   So now, what I've actually done here,
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.900]   just in the past three minutes of rambling here,
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.180]   I took a 10-year vision.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.820]   I went from 10 years to three, to one, to 90 days,
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.320]   or a quarter, down to a week, down to a day,
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.220]   down to an action.
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.100]   And every single morning I wake up and do the same thing.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.380]   So every morning of the week, I just wake up and I say,
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.620]   what is my most important step
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.420]   to accomplish the weekly goal?
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.260]   Every day.
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.900]   So I've taken a 10-year goal
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.900]   of buying $10 billion of real estate,
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.260]   and I've boiled the entire thing down to a 30-second task.
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.780]   Go to Google and type in
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.340]   personal assistant job description, and hit enter.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.580]   My entire future, my family's future,
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.940]   my generational wealth,
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.500]   is all dependent on a 30-second Google search.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.560]   And then I do it.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.780]   And then I can do it again five minutes after that.
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.860]   So that's my entire goal-setting process,
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.260]   and I just bake it inside my journal.
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.220]   But yeah, that's it.
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.220]   - And are there systems you use throughout the day
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.180]   to keep on track?
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.980]   You know, if you're looking at it in the morning,
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.060]   but you wanna, is there a way you structure your day
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.020]   or your workflow to be more productive?
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.620]   - I have a personal assistant,
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.420]   so she makes me do a lot of things that are important.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.620]   So actually, let's talk about hacking real quick, right?
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.220]   Like the idea of like, you know, credit card hacking,
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.540]   or travel hacking, or, you know, house hacking.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.740]   Let's talk about self-discipline hacking.
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.580]   I have zero self-discipline.
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.420]   Almost none.
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.260]   Like if there's a cookie on the counter, I will eat it.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.020]   If there is a meeting I can skip, I will skip it.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.700]   If there is anything I need to do, I will let myself down.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.100]   I will lie to myself.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.540]   I will disappoint myself all day long.
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.080]   As a result, I'm really bad at getting things done.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.660]   So I've had to hack my way
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.060]   into being productive and being efficient.
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.260]   I'll give you a couple examples.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.420]   One, I hire a personal assistant.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.060]   So Jane, who's my assistant right now, Jane's awesome.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.380]   Jane makes sure that I do the most important things,
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.220]   and will yell at me.
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.380]   And I tell her that she has permission
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.700]   to like force me to do things.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.300]   And there's ways to do it, right?
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.300]   For example, the massage.
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.460]   I mentioned earlier, I get a massage once a week.
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.720]   I don't get a massage because it feels good.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.820]   I mean, yes, it feels good, right?
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.340]   Like massages are fun.
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.600]   I get a massage because I know the most important thing
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.780]   as an entrepreneur that I can do
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.580]   is have uninterrupted thinking time every week.
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.620]   But I don't do it.
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.540]   Like I won't do it.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.640]   I will write down, I'll put on my calendar, you know,
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.820]   go sit at the beach and go think for an hour and a half.
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.420]   Or just process, journal, I won't do it.
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.580]   'Cause I lie to myself,
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.660]   and I disappoint myself all the time.
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.340]   But when Adriana, my Brazilian masseuse,
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.940]   shows up in my driveway,
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.580]   and she's pulling behind this giant massage chair,
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.500]   well, now I'm gonna do it, right?
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.960]   'Cause I've now obligated myself to somebody else.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.980]   So then I go and get an hour and a half long massage.
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.020]   And most of the best ideas and problem solving I've had
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.420]   are during that massage.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.440]   So a massage is simply a way
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.280]   that I have hacked my lack of self-discipline
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.600]   to do the things that I wanna do.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.080]   I hire a personal trainer to come to my house to work out.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.720]   I do the food thing, like you said.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.520]   I have somebody now helping with the kids
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.440]   so that I can do other things.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.240]   I align my life so that way I am obligated
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.680]   to do the things that I know I need to do,
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.320]   but lack the self-discipline to get it done.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.440]   I even have accountability groups,
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.160]   like mastermind groups that we meet every week
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.360]   and go through our goals.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.700]   All this is designed to get me to just do something
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.700]   'cause I'm so darn lazy.
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.500]   Let me just throw out a couple more ideas
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.260]   in case people are interested in more ways
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.420]   they can kind of hack their laziness
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.420]   or their self-discipline.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.580]   One of them, I am a big believer in like checking boxes.
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.380]   Maybe I can, there's a great, the Seinfeld strategy.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.460]   Let's talk about this one.
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.140]   Seinfeld has this quote from years ago.
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:53.960]   It's probably made up.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.980]   It's probably one of those like Abe Lincoln
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.820]   said it kind of things,
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.380]   but where he said, "Every day he writes one joke.
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.440]   "And when he's done with the joke,
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.360]   "he puts a big check mark on like a spreadsheet
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.340]   "or something like that.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.180]   "And after a while,
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.620]   "you start getting a lot of check marks in a row."
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.900]   And so his advice to this up-and-coming comedian he gave
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.540]   was don't break the chain of check marks.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.920]   Just don't break the chain.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.240]   So I'm a bigger believer of doing little tiny actions
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.120]   over and over and over and over,
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.980]   and then putting them on a checklist.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.100]   Like that's why I said I have a checklist
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.100]   inside my bathroom mirror
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.860]   for some of our relationship habits.
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.460]   But I do it in my journal every single morning.
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.540]   So for example, like read one page.
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.880]   I can read one page.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.500]   Or I can, I'm really bad at flossing, right?
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.140]   So like I'll be like, I'm gonna floss.
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.420]   Like these are things, now I'm not good at it,
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.940]   but because I'm tracking it now
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.380]   and because I have an accountability group
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.500]   that looks at my tracking,
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.420]   I've now, like I would look stupid
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.260]   if I showed up and was like,
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.480]   "Yeah, well, I said I was gonna eat healthy all week,
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.700]   "but I just ate, you know, Cheetos and Mai Tais all week."
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.620]   Like I would just look stupid
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.500]   'cause I don't wanna disappoint my accountability buddies.
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.580]   Like the other guys that are like,
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.020]   "Hey, we're gonna, you know, build our businesses too."
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.580]   So I don't wanna look bad in front of other people.
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.460]   So I will then get that, what do you wanna call it?
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.140]   Account, I guess accountability around them.
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.220]   In fact, in my own company,
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.700]   I operate a system called EOS.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.820]   Have you read Traction?
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.220]   Gino Wickman's Traction?
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.940]   So Gino Wickman has a book called Traction.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.100]   It's right here.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.800]   Get a grip on your business.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.800]   It's basically a system for pulling all the different pieces
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.200]   of your business together into one cohesive system.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   And so it's kinda like what I said earlier with the goals.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.280]   You have your big 10-year goal maybe and a three-year goal,
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.080]   and you track it down to a meeting
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.840]   that you have once a week with your team.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.880]   But in that meeting, I say out loud in that meeting,
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.880]   like last week I said I would do blank and I blank.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.000]   Like last week I said I would call three investors.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.280]   I called two.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.720]   In other words, I have to fail.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.660]   I have to publicly fail in front of my team
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.880]   if I don't deliver on the thing I said I was going to do.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.880]   So by adding in that piece of the meeting
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.860]   through the book Traction,
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.360]   again, we operate on this kind of system,
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.180]   but that piece of the meeting is I said I would do this,
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.280]   I did this.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   That holds me accountable
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.040]   because although I will let myself down,
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.920]   I don't wanna let my team down.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.780]   I don't wanna let them down.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:20.020]   So the more I can obligate myself to things,
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.820]   the more likely the things get done.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.460]   I mean, at the end of the day,
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.820]   you are the results of what you repeatedly do.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:27.660]   I'm gonna say that again
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.100]   'cause this is like one of the most profound statements.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:29.980]   I didn't invent it.
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.500]   I've heard it said many different times
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.620]   in many different ways.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.120]   You, well, I'll say you get the results
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.980]   of what you repeatedly do.
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.380]   You eat chips and nachos and Mai Tais every day,
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.940]   you're going to get overweight.
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.660]   You jog every single day, you're going to lose weight.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.060]   You spend 15 minutes every day
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.280]   looking into your significant other's eyes,
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.340]   having a real conversation,
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.440]   you're going to have a better relationship.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.460]   You avoid them, you're gonna have a bad one, right?
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.040]   So there are certain things in life
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.100]   that give us the result of life that we want.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.760]   So all we need to do to be successful in anything,
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.580]   I really believe this, is like know where you wanna go,
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.820]   know what things are going to get you there.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.400]   And when I say things, I mean the habits,
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.620]   the traits, the systems, whatever.
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.300]   So know where you wanna go,
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.800]   know the things that are gonna get you there,
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.660]   track those things and get accountability on it.
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.660]   If it's a group of guys getting accountability together,
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.300]   or guys meaning guys or girls,
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.800]   or is it hiring a performance coach?
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.140]   Whatever that is, get the accountability.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.740]   So know where you're going,
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.860]   figure out what the steps are needed to get there,
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.360]   track it so you can be aware of you getting there
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.460]   or not getting there, and then get accountability
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.100]   so you can hack your self-discipline.
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.260]   You can accomplish anything, anything by doing that.
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.180]   - So you've got your group of accountability partners,
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.900]   you've got your spouse, you've got your team,
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.260]   you've got all these systems,
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.980]   but you also have a performance coach.
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.180]   Tell me about what that brings to the table.
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.280]   - It's like therapy.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.180]   It's literally just like, it's like once a week,
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.660]   somebody asks me a bunch of hard questions
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.500]   and I have to answer them and think deeper.
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.340]   So just like the massage time is forcing me
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.880]   to have that unstructured, just open thinking time,
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.500]   the performance time is forced time
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.380]   to work on my business, not in my business,
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.080]   to work on my life and not in my life.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.060]   So my coach, his name is Jason Derese,
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.540]   it's like trees with a D at the end, Derese.
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.180]   He's like, he'll ask me just very simple questions,
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.420]   like, so where are you not playing fully out right now?
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.700]   Or is that really what you want
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.260]   or is that just what you're expected to say, right?
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.860]   There's like very like therapy type questions,
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.140]   usually around my business,
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.700]   so we get into a lot more than just business,
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.460]   but it's just a time every week
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:46.460]   that I'm forced to look at my business like an outsider,
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.100]   to look at my life like an outsider
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.340]   and just say like, what can I do better?
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.720]   How can I improve this?
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.980]   Like a performance coach is something I believe
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.640]   every single human should have if you can afford it.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.100]   And if you can't afford it,
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.780]   then get a group of people together and do the same thing,
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.220]   just do it for free with a group of people.
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.620]   You know, like it's not as powerful
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.540]   'cause you're not paying somebody,
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.380]   so there's no really like bias for action on their part
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.520]   to actually hold you accountable,
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.700]   but if you can pay someone to ask those tough questions,
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.180]   how does that not pay off a hundredfold?
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.260]   Even if like one, like even if 10,
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.220]   even if only 10% of the calls I do with Jason are effective,
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:32.080]   the one out of 10 will completely transform my life, right?
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.700]   In fact, I left the BiggerPockets podcast after 10 years
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.240]   from it all started with a question he asked me.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.080]   He just said, "It sounds like
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:39.900]   "you're getting kind of burned out.
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.680]   "Do you need to take a month off?
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.740]   "How's that sit with you?
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.660]   "Does that feel light or does that feel heavy?"
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.600]   And I'm like, month off sounds amazing.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.100]   I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna take a month off.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.180]   I had never taken time off the podcast.
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.540]   And that one question led to taking a month off,
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.980]   which then once I was like,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.020]   had decided that it was okay to take a month off,
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.180]   I was like, wait, why don't I just take the whole thing off?
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.020]   Do I, why don't I just stop?
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.660]   Why don't I just focus on the other part of my business?
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.660]   So having that person who just dives into your psyche
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.500]   and asks you good questions always pays off.
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.020]   I believe it, always.
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.500]   - Where would you tell someone who believes you?
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.820]   They're like, great, I need one.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.220]   Where do they go to find a performance coach?
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.100]   - It's tough, man.
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.620]   I mean, you can go to the big organizations
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.780]   like the Tony Robbins or whatever,
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.100]   and there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.100]   I like my guy, I got it from a referral.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.540]   Again, Jason Dries, I think it's Jason Dries Coaching.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.860]   Like, he's got a bunch of people under him.
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.940]   Like, those are like the big ones.
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.380]   There's a company called Strategic Coach with Dan Sullivan.
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.940]   In fact, his name's actually, the reason I thought of it,
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.900]   his name's on the front of the traction book.
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.660]   He's a coach that helps people.
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.900]   I think just knowing that you need that,
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.340]   and then just talking to people and putting it out there,
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.900]   and just like hiring an employee.
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.260]   Let's go back to that previous conversation we had, right?
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.340]   If you just like, it's really easy
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.020]   to find a performance coach.
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.700]   It's really hard to find a good performance coach
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.620]   that's going to hold you accountable and such.
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.860]   Yeah, I always think someday it'd be fun
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.140]   to own a performance coaching company.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.780]   I don't own one now, but it'd be kind of fun to do so
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.020]   because I believe so strongly in it.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.060]   I don't know, do you have a recommendation?
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.360]   Let's fire it back at you.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.200]   - I don't know if I have a recommendation
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.620]   of where to find someone, but I think,
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.760]   something different between an employee and a coach
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.140]   is that there are a lot of very good coaches.
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.940]   We talked about it, it's hard to find a good employee.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.340]   There are a lot of very good coaches
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.620]   that might be very not good for you.
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.620]   And so I think when you hire employees,
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.000]   you're like, ah, is this employee bad?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.540]   And you're like, yeah, they are, I gotta let them go.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.300]   A lot of times, and this has happened to me,
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:38.940]   I had the highest recommended executive CEO coach
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.860]   when I was a founder.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.060]   Every single person I knew loved this person.
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.620]   And as a friend, I love this person.
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.860]   But for me, they weren't actually the best coach.
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.740]   And it took me a long time to figure that out
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.460]   because I was so caught up in the fact
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.940]   that everyone said they were a great coach.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.260]   Everyone said they're amazing.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.640]   So something must be wrong with me
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.560]   if I'm not getting the most out of this.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.820]   I think when it comes to coaching,
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.260]   when it comes to therapy,
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.820]   I think it's important to realize
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.680]   that there are people that are really good at their job
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.140]   that might not be really good working with you.
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.260]   And you might have to experiment.
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.060]   You might have to try a handful of coaches
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.660]   till you find the one that pushes you in the right way.
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.100]   And all of them might be good.
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.680]   So don't assume that because someone's good,
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.660]   they're good for you.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.940]   That would be my advice.
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.860]   - That is phenomenal advice, right?
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.580]   Because, and there's also different types of coaches, right?
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.740]   'Cause like, you might not need the guy
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.740]   who's gonna be like, you need to get to 10X your business,
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.940]   you know, grow, grow, grow.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.220]   Like, you might need like, hey, you need to slow down
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.980]   and go be a father for a little bit.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.200]   Like, you're not, you're like,
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.800]   and like different coaches are gonna push you
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.640]   in different ways.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.360]   Then there's also like the coaches that are like,
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.560]   they're gonna teach you how to do a certain task.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.200]   And then there's the coaches that are just gonna add
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.040]   more like a therapy.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.240]   They're gonna do it wherever direction you wanna go.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.720]   So yeah, and just trying out a bunch of them,
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.980]   trying to find what fits, I think is just,
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.960]   they're out there.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.040]   And if you know that's what you need, just pursue it.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.120]   Put it out there in the universe again,
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.920]   law of attraction, quote unquote,
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.440]   or just knowing what you want
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.220]   and then relentlessly pursuing it,
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.160]   you're gonna find somebody great.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.760]   And then you're going to transform your life.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.840]   I really believe that.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:06.680]   - So I wanna get to family,
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.000]   but first, can you talk about the Starbucks strategy?
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.620]   We talked about a bunch of strategies.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.520]   This is one that I've seen you talk about
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.220]   when it comes to big tasks.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.520]   Let's hear about it.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.400]   - Yeah, so, all right.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.240]   So we're talking like,
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.120]   you've heard the analogy of the book writing.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.240]   Have I mentioned that, the Starbucks?
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.760]   - Not in this podcast.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.600]   - Not that one?
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.420]   - No, I have.
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.260]   - Oh, but you know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.320]   Okay, I just wanna make sure
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.240]   that we're the same Starbucks strategy, all right.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.380]   So, all right, so Starbucks strategy looks like this.
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.900]   It's essentially, I call it that
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.820]   just because this is how I've written my books.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.780]   I've got, I've written like five books, right?
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:39.740]   The first book I wrote,
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.460]   it was called "The Book on Investing in Real Estate
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.140]   "with No and Low Money Down," longest title ever.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.620]   And I wrote that like, I'm gonna write a book.
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.680]   So I sat down one day and I started writing some words
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.940]   and then I put it away for a few weeks.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.340]   And I came back and I wrote a few more words
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.460]   and then I put it away for a few weeks.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.460]   When I was inspired, I wrote some words.
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.480]   That book was hell to write.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.280]   It took me over a year to write it.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.560]   I hated every second of it.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.560]   I did not enjoy writing it.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.400]   It turned out fine.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.800]   The book's fine, you should read it.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.200]   If you have no money, 'cause it's a book for no money.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.160]   Then the second time I was like,
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.140]   I don't wanna do that again,
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.400]   but I need to write this other book
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.000]   on rental property investing.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.040]   So that time I said, I'm gonna pursue this differently.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.120]   First of all, I'm gonna learn
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.900]   how other people write nonfiction books.
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.880]   And I studied a lot and so this whole strategy
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.520]   comes from a bunch of other people.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.340]   I didn't make this up.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.420]   I don't make up anything.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.380]   I just regurgitate stuff, right?
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.120]   So I go to this, I go to Starbucks with my wife.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.000]   Actually, she was gonna write a book at the same time.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.280]   She was gonna write it on managing.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.960]   I was gonna write it on just investing in rentals.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.920]   And we sat down at a Starbucks and we said,
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.160]   we made a commitment to ourselves and said,
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.120]   we will not leave this Starbucks
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.520]   until our book is 100% perfectly outlined.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.800]   It's really that quote, like the Abe Lincoln quote,
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.920]   again, who knows if he said it,
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.440]   but he said, if I had six hours to chop down a tree,
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.940]   I would spend the first four sharpening my ax.
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.180]   So what this whole strategy was was like,
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:00.440]   I'm gonna spend a focused, dedicated,
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.300]   nonstop period of time to sharpen the ax.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.900]   So for me, I sat down, I spec'd out the entire book
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.660]   on note cards, 10 chapters, it was like 12 chapters,
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.060]   12 sub chapters, flip every card over
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.060]   and it had an outline of what that sub chapter
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.180]   was gonna be about.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.200]   So at the end of the day now, every day after that,
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.980]   I ended up with like 100 note cards,
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.480]   I think, actually, when I was done.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.440]   Every day, I had a note card for 100 days straight
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.680]   with what chapter it's in, what the sub chapter is,
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.720]   and then three, four, five bullet points
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.000]   on what I had to write.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.100]   Well, that's easy.
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.120]   Now I just gotta write 500 words to 1,000 words a day.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.680]   And within exactly 100 days later,
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.560]   my wife and I both finished a book
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.800]   and we had two full books.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.820]   Total length was almost 300,000 words between the two.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.800]   And yeah, I've sold over a million copies
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.640]   of those books now.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:52.640]   Like, all I'm getting at here is like define,
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.760]   like sharpen your axe, define what success
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.160]   is gonna look like, do the work up front
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.480]   and it makes everything else easier on the backend.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.000]   - So you talked about family.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.440]   I think that there are very few people in the world
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.720]   who would say one of my big goals
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.240]   is to do anything measured in billions, right?
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.800]   You mentioned $10 billion of real estate.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.640]   Most of the people I know that really, really prioritize
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.960]   crazy, audacious business goals,
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.320]   don't often talk also about prioritizing
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.160]   being a good partner and being a good parent.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.740]   And having listened to you talk a lot,
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.600]   it's something you do more than most.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.440]   How do you find that balance?
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.540]   - I mean, so first of all, yeah, I got into real estate.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.080]   I got into financial freedom,
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.080]   the pursuit of financial independence.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.440]   And I know it's kind of a buzzword, right?
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.320]   But all I'm talking about is when I say financial
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.000]   independence, the ability to do what you want,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.080]   where you want, when you want,
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.240]   how you want with whoever you want,
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.560]   whomever you want, I don't know.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.020]   It's just that freedom, right?
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.560]   That comes with having money.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.420]   It was never about getting rich,
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.560]   never about being a billionaire
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.500]   or anything like that, right?
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.800]   I wanted to pursue financial independence for one,
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.720]   two reasons, two reasons.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.240]   And I think both of these will resonate with you, right?
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.920]   Number one, when I was growing up,
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.960]   like my dad worked really hard,
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.200]   but he wasn't there much 'cause he worked all the time.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.680]   And so I rarely saw him.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.280]   And I said, when I am a father someday,
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.320]   I want to be there for every ball game,
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.280]   every ballet recital, every field trip.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.620]   I want to be there with my kids.
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.820]   I want to like be the best father I can possibly be.
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.800]   And I can't work 40, 50, 60 hours a week
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.520]   and have commuting to be able to do that.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.080]   So I started with that, and that was the one thing.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.640]   The second thing I said,
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.000]   I heard a quote once that said the world is a book
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.600]   and those who don't travel read just a page.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.440]   Like the world is so amazing, right?
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.280]   So big, and there's so many things to see out there.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.640]   And I wanted to see as much of it as I can
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.600]   while we're here on this earth.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.760]   And I knew that again, being broke
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.080]   and working 40, 50 hours a week
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.360]   and getting my two weeks paid vacation every year,
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.260]   that wasn't gonna cut it.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.640]   So combining those two things,
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.520]   that's why I pursued real estate and business
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.640]   and wealth in general.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.000]   Now, fast forward a few years,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.400]   and I find myself sometimes just like,
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.420]   I mean, I've achieved it.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.640]   I could retire right now
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.840]   and just sit on a beach and do nothing,
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.600]   but I'd be bored out of my mind, right?
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.760]   I can only play Barbies and G.I. Joes
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.440]   for so many hours a day.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.960]   So there's this balance that you have to have.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.080]   And there is no, to quote Gary Keller in "The One Thing,"
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.000]   there is no such thing as work-life balance.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.020]   It's work-life balancing.
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.080]   It's a constant influx, a flow
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.160]   that you sometimes have to go farther one way,
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.040]   and sometimes you have to go farther the other.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:41.040]   And therefore, I am constantly re-evaluating
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.640]   where I am on that spectrum
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.800]   of too much work and maybe too much family, right?
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.740]   'Cause as an entrepreneur, too,
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.880]   we get paid in the future for the work we do today.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.560]   We don't get paid today for the work we do today, right?
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.120]   So we have to do the work now
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.560]   to get paid five years from now.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.220]   We gotta plant the seeds today in order to harvest then,
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.600]   but I also need to make sure
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.520]   that my kids are being brought up right
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.920]   and that they're connected with me
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.120]   and that we have that solid relationship.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.760]   So I guess that's why I talk about it a lot,
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:13.120]   because I'm very scared, is that the wrong word, maybe?
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.100]   I'm very concerned that at the end of my life,
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.880]   I will look back and say, why did I work so much?
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.560]   Like, why didn't I do the things
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.760]   that are most important in life?
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.280]   And the only way to know that is to continually evaluate it
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.040]   and to have the conversation with people.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.680]   So I love when this topic comes up
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.840]   because it forces me to introspectively look at my life
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.840]   and say, how am I doing right now?
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.300]   Like, can I do better?
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.440]   Can I get more balance?
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.480]   What about you?
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.780]   - So it's interesting.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.440]   I used to be someone,
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.360]   well, I still am someone who really loves productivity,
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.220]   like inbox zero, kind of everything,
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.520]   but one thing that I recently picked up,
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.320]   so we have two daughters, two and three months,
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.360]   so still, you know, the deal.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.820]   - You're in it, you're in it.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.700]   - I always wanted to like get to inbox zero,
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.400]   but I've lately still prioritized, right?
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.420]   When I'm working, I'm working in the most efficient manner,
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.240]   but when I get to the end of the day,
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.640]   and it's actually nice
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.580]   that sometimes kids just force this, right?
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.540]   Like we have an au pair, she's done at 5.30,
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.520]   like there's no real option.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.760]   Like you gotta be there at 5.30.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.900]   I just kinda like let it drop.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:28.280]   And I think I've spent so much time in my life
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.020]   feeling like, gosh, everything I do today is for the future.
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.920]   I need to get it all done, I need to get all done.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.680]   And then the next morning, I'm like,
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.640]   it didn't really matter
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.880]   that I got everything done before I went to bed.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.560]   Now, there are times, you know, Tuesday night,
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.800]   this show comes out on Wednesday mornings,
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.640]   or maybe this bonus episode on a Friday,
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.680]   like there are times where it's like,
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.640]   no, I do have to stay up
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.900]   'cause this thing comes out this time.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.760]   But for the most part, there are a lot of things
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.160]   that you feel a lot of pressure to do.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.760]   And I found that the more I've built the muscle
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.200]   of getting comfortable with not doing some things,
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.120]   whether it's a task at hand,
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.200]   or it's just saying no to a meeting,
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.240]   the more you get comfortable with it,
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.400]   the more, one, it's easier,
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.820]   and two, you realize it doesn't matter.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.560]   So I remember I got this email from a guy named James Bashar,
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.600]   who has a podcast called "Below the Line."
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.720]   And I said, we'd connected in the past,
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.560]   and it'd been a few years.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.960]   I reached back out to him, and he said,
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.400]   you know what, I don't really wanna do meetings
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.760]   'cause I'm trying to prioritize other things in my life,
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.440]   but I'm really down with asynchronous communication.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.280]   So if you want, you could go and use a tool like Loom,
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.480]   and you could record a conversation you wanna have,
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.400]   part of it, and then I'd be glad to get back to you.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.640]   And I was like, oh, wow.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.720]   So one, it really raised the bar.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.980]   I'm not gonna go record a video to talk to him
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.160]   to just shoot the breeze.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.460]   So he's basically filtering for,
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.920]   if you just wanna have a BS conversation and talk,
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.480]   that's gone.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   And at the time, I wanted to catch up with him
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.680]   'cause I was trying to start a podcast,
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.640]   but I didn't really have my questions formulated,
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.260]   and it actually forced me to wait
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.120]   and ask when the time was right.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.680]   And then I started using that,
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.680]   and boy, it makes everything so much more efficient,
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.680]   and it's just helped me prioritize.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.960]   So if someone says, hey, you've started companies,
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.640]   can you help me figure out how to start a company
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.800]   in the space that you did?
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.620]   I say, great.
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:12.600]   If you wanna go to Loom,
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.520]   and you wanna record some specific questions
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.640]   or write 'em out in an email,
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.280]   I'm happy to answer those questions.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.360]   And if it eventually makes sense for us to chat,
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.800]   I'm happy to, but there's a lot going on right now,
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.840]   and I just have to let some things drop,
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.640]   and it's nothing personal.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.860]   And learning to do that and getting comfortable doing that
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:33.380]   has made it so much more comfortable to go and say,
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.180]   you know what, this week, our au pair is out of town.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.220]   She's in Boston, New York, Chicago, having a blast,
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.500]   and that means there's no childcare and two kids is a lot.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.740]   And so other than this interview,
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.180]   I basically have no meetings all week.
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.980]   And I'm okay with that, and I'm letting things drop
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.660]   because I've gotten comfortable with that skill.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.940]   That's been the biggest thing for me
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.420]   is that comfort with doing something
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:00.560]   that in your grindy kind of '20s, early '30s time of life
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.900]   just felt unfathomable.
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.160]   It's like, I gotta get it done.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.580]   Letting it go is very cathartic.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.600]   - You know, that reminds me, and I love how you say like,
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.820]   you know, as soon as you gotta drop some stuff, right?
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.580]   In the book, "The One Thing," I'll bring it up again,
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.400]   Gary Keller, Jay Papasan, they have the book, "The One Thing,"
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.900]   and they tell the story or the metaphor in there
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.540]   that says that life is like juggling a bunch of balls, right?
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:25.740]   You're juggling family, health, your work, your career,
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.060]   your financial life, you're balancing all those things.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.140]   And he says, some of those balls are rubber
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.620]   and some of them are glass, right?
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.540]   When you drop something at work, it'll bounce right back.
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.900]   Like typically nothing's really that bad,
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.460]   but there are glass balls in our life, right?
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.420]   Our relationship with our spouse or significant other
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.260]   is a glass ball, and you can only drop that so many times
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.500]   before it shatters.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.700]   And so there's this constant, yeah,
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.260]   I'm always thinking a lot of my life
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.220]   is going to get dropped.
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.680]   A lot of things are gonna get dropped.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.820]   Let's make sure we drop the right things.
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.220]   And that, at the end of my life,
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.180]   that would be a great reputation to have
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:07.420]   and a great dying thought is I drop the right balls
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.460]   throughout my life.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.820]   - And it's funny 'cause I respected the email I got
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.580]   from James so much.
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.060]   You know, you think you have this email that's like,
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.520]   you know, I've had a handful of people
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.780]   that I would put in the category of like important people.
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:20.620]   Their emails are like,
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:23.000]   hey, I'm not checking email this summer.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.740]   And I'm like, damn, that person's like,
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:26.900]   they've got it figured out.
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.100]   I didn't write back and be like, that person's an asshole.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.980]   You know, like that, my reaction was like,
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.340]   this person is prioritizing their life,
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.100]   in many cases, better than me.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.980]   And so I would just encourage people to realize
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:40.980]   that most of people's reaction to your dropping the ball
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:45.500]   in a polite way might actually be kind of jealousy and envy
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.600]   more than, you know, frustration.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.520]   - And I would even, to push it to another level,
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.160]   if I could real quick, like another reason to do that
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.080]   by adding these bounds in your life,
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.800]   like things like, for example,
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.320]   like people might be surprised to hear this,
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.920]   but like I, I mean, I'm building a billion dollar brand.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.920]   I have a billion dollars of real estate.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.280]   We'll buy 10 billion.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.560]   That should make my company about a billion in profit
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.040]   over the next five to 10 years.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.680]   Like that's, it's a legit like billion dollar
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.880]   profit business.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.560]   And I work at most five hours a week.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.400]   Like that's it.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.960]   Like I don't work a lot of hours at this.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.740]   I'm going to launch a new business next year
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.060]   that I think is going to be awesome.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.420]   And I'm from day one, I have the requirement.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.020]   I do not work more than five hours a week at this.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.940]   And the cool thing is, is by having those boundaries,
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.580]   I am forced to build a business that I am not within.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.220]   Like I am building it from the outside looking in.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.500]   I'm not building it from the inside up.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.740]   I'm not doing every single role.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.780]   I'm saying, no, that's, that's the rules of this,
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.180]   of this business, of this game.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.680]   I'm going to play within the rules.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.920]   And, and so many people don't realize that you get to,
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.680]   you get to make whatever rules you want.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.640]   This is your game.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.800]   Like your business is your game.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.840]   Make it however you want.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.680]   So establish rules.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.120]   Like I only work this much.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.240]   I don't work Fridays.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.920]   I take Wednesday and Thursday and Friday off.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.920]   Like who cares, right?
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:03.160]   And then you will, you will find a way to be successful.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.760]   Cause if you're listening to this podcast
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.840]   an hour in or whatever we're in, like you're,
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.200]   you're a legit person.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.440]   You're going to find a way to be massively successful
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.160]   within the bounds of, within the rules that you establish.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.360]   So establish them.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.000]   Don't just play what's given to you.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.120]   Define what you want to do, what sounds amazing.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.560]   And then just go after that.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.840]   - If you haven't read the book from Strength to Strength
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.600]   from Arthur Brooks, I think you should.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.720]   I think you'd enjoy it.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.880]   I had him on the podcast and it's about
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.920]   finding a new form of happiness as you transition
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.520]   from a style of intelligence and work in your early life
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.280]   that, that isn't as compatible in the second half of life.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.280]   And second half is not like seventies.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.880]   It's like, you know, late thirties, forties kind of age.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.800]   We were like, I'm finding a new way to work
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.600]   that is more compatible with long-term happiness.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.200]   So that's one book I shared.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.520]   You shared a lot of books.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.720]   I want to jump to, to just get, are there other books?
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.560]   Where do you find them?
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.140]   You seem to have them and collected them.
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.520]   And you know, they've had a huge impact on you.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.840]   Where are you finding them all?
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.680]   And do you publish a list of them?
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.760]   So people who want more of your recommendations
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.600]   can find them?
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.420]   - I do read a lot.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.080]   I read, I read about a book a week on average,
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.000]   sometimes two, sometimes half, depends on how busy I am.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.560]   But I probably average 50 to a hundred books a year,
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.400]   pretty much every year.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.420]   So I read and I buy, I have a rule with books.
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.220]   If I think about buying a book,
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.120]   if even the hint of an idea of like,
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.240]   oh, that might be a good book, I always buy it.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.960]   I think books are the best investment
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.360]   in the entire universe.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.400]   I don't think anything comes close
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.160]   to the monetary investment of a book.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.200]   But I don't have a list anywhere per se.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.760]   I do have an email, like I have a text message newsletter.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.860]   Everyone does like newsletters.
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.280]   And I was like, how can I be different?
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.620]   So I have a text message newsletter.
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.960]   Every Wednesday I send out a text
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.040]   that has like a book that I'm reading
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.760]   and some little piece of advice that I got, et cetera.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.220]   So that's just beardybrandon.com as I put that out there.
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.640]   There's no like sales, I'm not selling anything there.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.440]   It's just like, I read a lot.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.120]   So I'm always like, hey, here's what I'm reading right now.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.100]   And here's a cool point from the book that they made.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.860]   So yeah, I read a lot.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.960]   I mean, I give you 5 million recommendations.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.600]   And I remember a lot of what I read as well
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.160]   because I always assume I'm gonna have to teach it.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.000]   You ever seen those studies?
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Like, you remember whatever, 10% of what you hear
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.300]   and 20% of what you read, blah, blah, blah.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.540]   The studies have shown that the number one best way
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:24.000]   to remember something is not to teach it per se.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.900]   I've heard that said before,
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.640]   but it's actually a little more nuanced than that.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.180]   It's to read or I should say to learn
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.580]   as if you had to teach it.
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:33.980]   So every time I read a book,
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.580]   I assume I'm going to have to teach this somebody later,
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.060]   even it's my own spouse.
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.360]   So when you read from that perspective,
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.160]   your mind categorizes it in like,
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.080]   that's a weird way of saying that,
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.160]   categorizes it, I don't know, whatever,
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.180]   files it away in a different part of the brain
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.040]   that's easier to recall later on.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.000]   And so I heard this hack, I don't know, 20 years ago,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.240]   but it's made such an impact on my life
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.240]   as I read everything now with a pen
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.080]   and I assume I'm gonna have to teach it later,
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:58.920]   even though I might not.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.840]   And then I remember it's all up here, not all of it,
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.880]   but a lot of it's up there.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.520]   So I don't know if that answers your question.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.440]   Do you want me to just give you a,
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.200]   I'll give you an hour long list of good books to read.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.040]   - No, no, no, this is great.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.640]   Do you use that pen to take notes,
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.840]   use physical books, not eBooks?
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:11.760]   What's the process?
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.000]   - I do.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.680]   Yeah, I like, I mean, Audible's great.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.920]   If I'm working out, I'm usually listening to an audio book,
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.760]   but usually the work,
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.640]   like usually audio is more for podcasts
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.600]   'cause you can't read a podcast very easily.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.760]   And I try to only do physical books.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.200]   Kindle, I'll do fiction books
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.980]   'cause I'm not underlining in whatever.
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.920]   So Kindle's for fiction, physical for nonfiction.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.960]   And then it's really just about like people,
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.080]   I actually get asked all the time,
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.480]   "How do you read so many books?"
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.800]   And I'm like, I literally just read
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.040]   for like 10 minutes a day.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.240]   It's not much.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:45.200]   But I also read whenever I have a quick break,
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.960]   I try to read instead of pull up my phone and scroll.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.680]   Like as soon as that pull to grab my phone,
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.880]   and I'm not great at this at all.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.960]   I'll say I'm terrible at this,
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.560]   but I try whenever that pull to my phone,
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.360]   like I need that dopamine hit,
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.440]   I'll look around and if there's a book near me,
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.200]   I'll grab that instead or I'll try to grab that instead.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.800]   And I'll just read a couple pages.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.440]   My two, three, four pages, I'll put it down.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.920]   I'm typically in the middle of 20 to 30 books
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.200]   at any given time, which is completely nuts, but.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.260]   - That sounds like a topic for another day.
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.880]   - That is, yeah, yeah.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.600]   - The last big thing I want to ask about
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.080]   that I think few people talk about
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.480]   as much as I've heard you talk about it is,
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.160]   you talked about the purpose of all this
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.620]   isn't just to have a boatload of money.
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.000]   It's not just to be a billionaire and all that.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.080]   And you've talked a lot about philanthropy.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.640]   So, and how that's become a more,
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.760]   a bigger focus in your life.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.800]   And I think beyond just saying why it's important,
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.680]   you've thought about ways to infuse it
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.680]   into your future business, your future endeavors.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.680]   Talk a bit about why it's important,
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.840]   but also how you're trying to bring it into your business
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.400]   that maybe is different than the way
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.400]   most people think about philanthropy.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.600]   - Few ways that I'm looking at it right now.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.560]   First of all, like I, all right, everyone believes this,
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.440]   but I really like internalize it.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.720]   Is that like, nobody gets out alive.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.160]   Like we all die and it doesn't make sense
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.520]   to be the richest guy in the graveyard.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.400]   Like I don't care about legacy.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.240]   I don't care about my kids being rich.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.560]   Like I don't plan to actually give my kids anything.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.480]   Maybe they'll get a little bit,
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.960]   maybe they'll get a property or two, whatever.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.560]   - Oh, they get that college savings property.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.000]   - Yeah, they get the college thing, yeah.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.520]   And what's great about that too, by the way,
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.320]   just go way back to the last episode that we did together,
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.520]   but that property, like I don't care
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.120]   if Rosie takes that one property
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.040]   and goes to college with it, or she starts a business.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.240]   I actually hope she'll just start a business with it
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.400]   or invest it in something.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.800]   But anyway, I don't need my kid to be rich because A,
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.560]   like you can't grow up in the Turner,
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.960]   the Brandon Turner household
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.960]   and not have all the skills you need to be successful,
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.000]   first of all, 'cause like I'm going to train her.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.880]   I train him every day.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.880]   I'm always talking about money and finances
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.520]   and entrepreneurship and Rosie has bake sales
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.320]   and Wilder will, you know, when he's a little older.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.360]   So either A, if they're not wealthy by the time
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.920]   they're in their mid 20s, then they don't,
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.200]   then they, there is some problem
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.160]   that they don't deserve the money anyway, right?
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.040]   Like my kids will either not need the money
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.640]   'cause they'll be so successful anyway,
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.680]   or they don't deserve the money
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.800]   because they can't handle it.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.200]   So anyway, that's why I'm not planning to give my kids money.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.720]   So in other words, what do I do with it then?
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.760]   I mean, wealth is kind of a game in some ways.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.840]   Like I don't have to earn more money and get wealthier,
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.040]   but it's kind of a fun, it's a fun challenge.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.400]   Like, can I give away a billion dollars?
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.280]   Like I would have laughed at that 10 years ago
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.640]   and now I'm like, well, shoot.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.640]   Yeah, I could definitely give away a billion dollars.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.560]   Plus happiness is largely derived for most people
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.360]   by giving away money.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.280]   And not just like throwing it to some random charity,
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.720]   but by doing something with it.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.400]   Like it's one thing to make money.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.840]   It's another thing to make money matter.
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.520]   So I wanna spend a lot of my time making money
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.680]   'cause I'm good at it.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.320]   I'm not just gonna like give away all my money right now
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.800]   and go live under a bridge.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.880]   Like I have been gifted with this ability
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.760]   to generate mass amounts of money.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.080]   So I'm gonna use that to its fullest ability.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.720]   And then I'm gonna make that money count.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.720]   I'm gonna make it matter through business.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.480]   So a couple of ways we do that.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.480]   Number one, there's like the obvious,
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.360]   like we try to take good care of our tenants
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.520]   and be good people and all that.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.080]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.400]   I wanna start, we're gonna start,
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.360]   actually we're gonna launch it hopefully
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.200]   in the next couple of months.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.560]   We're gonna raise capital for big apartment complexes.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.640]   And then we're going to take all the profit from that
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.680]   and just donate it.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:20.360]   So for example, let me give you a real simple.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.400]   We buy a $100 million building right now.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.760]   It's pretty normal by let's say $100 million building.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:28.560]   We have to raise 20 or $30 million from investors like you.
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.680]   You give the money, we will buy the property.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.360]   At the end of the deal, we sell it for $150 million.
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.720]   Very normal, very just 3%, 4% per year
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.680]   over the course of 10 years it gets there.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.560]   And then at the end of the deal, everyone gets their money.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.120]   We divide up all, everyone gets their piece of the pie
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.320]   and everyone is happy.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.680]   But what I wanna do is I wanna raise all that money.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.640]   And then at the end of the deal,
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.480]   when we sell the property two, three, four, five years later
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.000]   you get your investment back,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.440]   but all the profit, that $50 million goes to charity.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.240]   And I'm like, I could do like one of those a year
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.840]   and be like the biggest charity in the country.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.560]   Like it's stupid how good real estate
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.480]   and especially my division of real estate,
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.680]   syndication and multifamily,
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:11.680]   it's stupid how much profit we can create out of thin air
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.640]   and with that level of assuredness, of that little surety.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.240]   And so if I can just take like one out of every 10 deals
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.920]   I do and just donate it to good,
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:23.920]   that makes everyone feel good.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.440]   And then the LPs, even like you,
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.680]   if you were investing in that,
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.160]   not only do you get to feel good,
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.520]   not only do you get your money back,
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.680]   so you're not even donating it,
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.160]   you're just lending the money for a little while basically.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.880]   You also get a big tax write-off at the end.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.600]   And so it's like a win, win, win across the board.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.440]   Everyone feels good, everybody wins.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.480]   We're saving lives, we're stopping human trafficking,
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.600]   we're feeding kids, it's gonna be a good life.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.680]   So I'm fired up about that right now.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.520]   - I love it.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.600]   I think that's a great way to wrap this conversation.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.840]   But there is one thing that I like to ask everyone
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.360]   before we go and it's to pick a place.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.760]   And because I'm heading to Maui,
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.040]   I'm gonna just default you to pick Maui.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.720]   People that are coming to Maui,
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.880]   what should they be doing, eating, drinking
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.240]   to have a good trip?
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.080]   - Oh, dude, okay.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.200]   So first of all, if you're an alcoholic,
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.600]   no, if you drink alcohol, there is a drink at the,
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.800]   Monkey Pod is my favorite restaurant on the Island.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.000]   Monkey Pod has a drink, it's called the Mai Tai.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.520]   It's not like a normal Mai Tai if you've had one.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.080]   Just get the Monkey Pod Mai Tai, it's phenomenal.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.960]   Anything at Monkey Pod is phenomenal.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.200]   Anything there is amazing.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.480]   The side men, the pizza, pork and pineapple,
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.800]   the burger, one of the best ever.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.520]   All right, so Monkey Pod, amazing.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.240]   Maui Brewing Company, it's the one over
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.080]   where you're gonna be staying.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.840]   There's also one by my house down here.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.960]   Monkey, Maui Brew is amazing.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.480]   Moku Roots, if you're vegan, awesome vegan restaurant.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.960]   I'm not vegan, but it's phenomenal,
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.040]   just for those vegan people.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:43.880]   So that's the food.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.440]   I mean, there's a lot of good food on Maui,
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.640]   but Tin Roof up in Kahului.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.360]   Mm, the Mochiko Chicken Sandwich, ah!
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.560]   You just can't imagine better food than that.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.400]   It's so good.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.600]   And then, I mean, there's beaches everywhere.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.760]   Make sure you hit Black Rock.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.680]   Go jump off Cliff Dive off Black Rock,
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.760]   which is right over by the Ritz and the Sheraton
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.440]   and that whole kind of area there.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.920]   Mm, and then come down to Wailea,
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.640]   which is like a 40-minute drive from the other side
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.800]   of the Island where, like Kanapali.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.640]   But there's some lava fields down here.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.840]   You can drive through the lava fields.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.200]   Go to Big Beach.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.560]   If you wanna see a bunch of naked men, go to Little Beach.
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.640]   It's a great spot.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:24.440]   And then, oh man, it's so good.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.000]   Anyway, man, I can give you a thousand recommendations.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.840]   - Any of the activities that are worth doing are--
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.560]   - Road to Hana, for sure Road to Hana.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.400]   Everyone does the Road to Hana.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.400]   Have you ever done the Road to Hana?
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.280]   Have you been to Maui? - I've never been to Maui.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.640]   The Road to Hana seems like a great thing to do
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.880]   on a trip when you're not in tow
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.280]   with a three-month-old and a two-year-old.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.120]   - Yes.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.800]   Yes, probably.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.720]   You do get out a lot.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:47.800]   So here's the Road to Hana.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.000]   It's the best analogy for life, too.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.680]   Road to Hana, I did it once with some friends.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.120]   We all left at the same time.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.280]   There's no cell phone coverage on the Road to Hana.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.080]   So we leave and we stop at the first beach.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.840]   And we get out there and we look at like 50 turtles
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.800]   that are on the beach, just sunbathing these turtles,
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.560]   watching these world-class surfers
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.160]   just ripping on these surf waves, having a great time.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.040]   Sat down, watched this for a little bit,
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.760]   got back in the car, started driving.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.120]   To get to Hana, it takes us typically four to six hours.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.600]   An hour in, like, you know, we leave the beach.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.440]   We're just starting.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.680]   We're not even a mile on this road.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.320]   And I get a call from my friends
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.560]   and they've got cell phone reception.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.600]   I hadn't even lost it yet.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.400]   And they said, "Okay, we're in Hana, now what?"
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.120]   And I was like, "Oh no, there's nothing in Hana.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.720]   "You missed the point."
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.200]   Like, it's not about the destination.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.800]   It's about the journey.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.200]   So the Road to Hana is an amazing just picture of life
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.200]   in that there's nothing.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.400]   Now, maybe there's something at the end of life.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.240]   I had to believe there is.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.800]   Like, I'm a Christian guy, so I think there is.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.120]   But the point is, like, the point of life
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.320]   is not just to get to the end.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.440]   It's to enjoy it along the way.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.960]   So you could do Road to Hana with some little ones.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.200]   You stop every, like, 20 minutes to pull over
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.200]   and, like, see amazing waterfalls and turtles and stuff.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.960]   So Road to Hana is beautiful and awesome.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.880]   But I would understand if you don't wanna take a baby on it.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.880]   It's probably not a bad call.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:05.920]   - All right, well, I'm even more excited about Maui,
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.320]   especially for the eats.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.560]   - Oh, I forgot about the best thing.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.000]   I forgot about the best thing in all of Maui.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.680]   You take your family, you put 'em in the car,
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.680]   you drive over to Kihei, which is the area I live in.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.120]   You come up here to my road and you pull in my driveway,
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:19.640]   and then we hang out on my front lanai.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:20.520]   It's called the lanai.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.360]   It's like a front porch.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.520]   The kids swim in my pool, and you and I sit there
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.840]   and chat business for a couple hours.
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:26.600]   That is the best thing you can do in Maui.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.080]   So I'm officially inviting you here publicly
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:29.920]   to come hang out if you can.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.760]   - I will see you in a couple weeks.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:31.960]   - It's a good time.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.440]   - This has been fantastic.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.400]   Where can everyone listening stay on top
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.240]   of everything you're doing, working, building,
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:40.240]   this $10 billion of real estate you wanna buy one day?
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.760]   How do they stay on top?
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.760]   - Yeah, so the text message list is a good one.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:47.040]   Just Beardy, B-E-A-R-D-Y, Beard with a Y.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.200]   Beardybrandon.com is the text message thing.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.640]   And if anybody's interested in the real estate
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.760]   side of stuff, like investing with me and all that,
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:58.560]   odcfund, odcfund.com.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.680]   And if you go to odcfund.com/tax,
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.800]   I've got a e-book on taxes there,
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.760]   just so it's a short read on how do people
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.160]   save money on taxes, especially if you're wealthy?
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.880]   How does Donald Trump pay no taxes?
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.680]   Anyway, it's just a random thing I just put together
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:13.720]   a few weeks ago.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:14.720]   That's where it's at.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.640]   - Brandon, thank you so much for this extended conversation.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.400]   - Phenomenal, thanks for having me.
