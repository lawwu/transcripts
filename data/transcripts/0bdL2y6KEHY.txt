[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Chris writes in to ask this, "Why was it not good that man should be alone in
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Genesis 2? Alone in perfect communion with God, Pastor John. I don't necessarily
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   understand why this was not good." I love that question. I love the fact that Chris
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   is asking it because it means that he's really dealing with what matters, namely,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   if you have God, what more do you need? That's a really good question to ask.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   "Whom have I in heaven but Thee? On earth there's nothing that I desire besides
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Thee. My flesh and my heart may fail, but You are the strength of my heart and my
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   portion forever." That's a good question. So what did God mean then when He looks
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   at man alone, that is, alone with God, and says, "Not good." I love that question.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   And here's the answer. The defect, the not goodness, lies not in God's
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   insufficiency to be all that the man needs for his joy. The defect is in the
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   man's inability to see all that God has to show him and to display all that God
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   intends for him to display about God. He can't see it all, and he can't show it
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   all until there's another. So take this text from the New Testament as an
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   illustration, Romans 15.5. "May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   to live in such harmony with one another in accord with Christ so that you may
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   with one voice glorify the God and Father of Jesus Christ." That would be
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   impossible if there were one person. Impossible. "That you with one voice, a
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   harmonious people, receiving one another, loving one another as I have loved you,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   displaying my glory through community." That way, that would be impossible without
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   the other, which simply now opens the incredibly wide door of what God is up
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   to in creation. It is more glorious that there be more than one voice to glorify
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   God. It is more glorious that there be a choir than a solo. More glorious that
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   there be a church than a saint. More glorious that there be a star team than
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   a star player. More glorious that there be countless colors rather than just
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   gray. More glorious that there be countless smells than just roses. More
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   glorious that there be countless textures than just velvet. More glorious
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   that there be a billion galaxies, not just one. Or that there be male and female,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   not just male. Or that there be multiple ethnicities, and not just one. And so,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Chris, you get the idea. God created us for his glory. That part, I think, is
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   crystal clear to you. And my point is, he gets more glory in the harmonies of
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   diversity, like between male and female, and different races, different voices.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   More glory in the harmonies of diversity and multiplicity than in
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   solitariness. Male and female is one of those opportunities to glorify God that
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   would not have existed without woman. Or just man. God wouldn't get nearly the
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   glory that we ought to be giving him. And so, Paul picked up on it in Ephesians
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   5 when he said that this one flesh union is a portrayal of Christ and his church.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And that parable would not be told, and it would not be read by the world, had
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   God not said, "Nope, not good to be by yourself. We're making another."
