[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.120]   About 100 emails have come in from listeners regarding Mark Driscoll and your relationship
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.120]   with him.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.280]   Mostly the questions are centered on whether you now regret partnering with Mark Driscoll
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.680]   in the past.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.440]   Secondarily, are there any lessons you're taking away from that relationship?
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.140]   And third, do you agree with the decisions of Christian booksellers that have decided
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.640]   to pull Mark Driscoll's books off of their shelves?
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.680]   Well, let me take the, maybe I forget now the order, the first and the last I think,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.300]   the issue of regret and the issue of books on or off shelves and just dispense with those
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.080]   quickly and then tackle lessons a little more extensively.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.920]   First, no regret.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.080]   John Piper has no regret for befriending Mark Driscoll, going to Mark Driscoll's church
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.800]   and speaking at his events or having him come to the Jedi and God conference.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.240]   I do not regret that.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.400]   My regret is that I was not a more effective friend.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.800]   Mark knew he had flaws.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.760]   He knows he has flaws.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.560]   And I knew he had flaws.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.360]   He knew that I knew he had flaws.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.960]   There were flaws of leadership attitude, flaws of unsavory language that I think is just
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.920]   wrong for Christians to use, flaws of exegetical errors, say in regard to the Song of Solomon.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.480]   I wrote him a long critique of his use of the Song of Solomon.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.200]   I wrote him personally about these.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.360]   But I always hoped that in those cases, the relationship with me and with others would
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.080]   be redemptive and helpful.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.760]   He certainly gave me more time and counsel than I deserved.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.960]   I remember him sitting in the dining room downstairs from where we're making this recording
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.920]   right now and spending a long time with me and Noel, giving us good counsel about the
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.520]   last chapter of our ministry, then going home and producing a long paper for me to give
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.800]   guidance to me and the elders.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.840]   He didn't have to do that.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.200]   I didn't even ask him to do it.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.560]   So there was a mutuality about this, and I felt loved by Mark, and I wanted to love him
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.560]   in return.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.600]   I do hope for the best in Mark's life and ministry.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.440]   So no, I don't regret it, because the things he said when he spoke were true and helpful,
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.520]   and I tried to do the same at his church.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.240]   With regard to his books, whether they should sit on shelves in bookstores or churches or
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.560]   homes, that's a tough call.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.440]   If he's disqualified from being an elder, should he still exercise the teaching office
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.720]   of an elder through his books?
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.880]   That's one way to ask the question.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.960]   But sooner or later, a book becomes detached from the personal life of an author and stands
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.000]   on its own merits as true or helpful or not.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.240]   And I can see a temporary reaction to Mark stepping down by bookstores or churches where
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.560]   they pull those back so as not to give any kind of public affirmation of mistakes that
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.560]   Mark may have made, but then maybe in years to come, the books re-emerge as helpful, since
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.560]   I think most of what he has written has been true and helpful.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.960]   So let me turn to the lessons.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.960]   What have I learned?
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.600]   What can we learn from these recent events?
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.520]   Number one, people are very complex.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.880]   They are multilayered.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.060]   They are often paradoxical.
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.440]   The psalmist cries out, "Who can discern his errors?
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.240]   Declare me innocent of hidden faults."
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.560]   That's an amazing statement.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.880]   Some of our sins, he's saying, are hidden to ourselves.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.760]   He just asks, "I cannot discern my sins."
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.440]   We have flaws and sins that we cannot ourselves fathom.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.240]   And the second lesson follows.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:11.680]   We desperately need to take seriously what wise counselors tell us about ourselves.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:19.400]   If we have sins that are hidden from ourselves, then perhaps they're not hidden to others,
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.200]   and we do well to listen.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.320]   I think that's implied in that text.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.240]   Third, this also follows from those two.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.120]   Sometimes, and I've experienced this, sometimes you can see what others are saying, pointing
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.640]   out to you about yourself, and sometimes you can't.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.040]   And if you can see it, then you repent, and you fight the sin.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.280]   But what if you can't?
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.900]   Even after others tell you what they see, you look and you don't see it in the way they
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.900]   see it.
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.900]   What then?
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.600]   Well, in order to have any integrity, I think you have to go with what you see.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.760]   Otherwise, you'd be always jerked around by everybody on the street that tells you they
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.360]   see something, and you say, "Well, I don't think it's there."
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.360]   And Paul certainly did not agree with all the criticism that came against him, nor Jesus.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.600]   When they said he had a demon, he didn't have a demon.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.920]   His critics were wrong.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.320]   And the result is either a struggle—in other words, when you have people around you who
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.560]   say this is true of you, and you don't think it's true of you, then the result is there's
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.440]   a struggle for leadership, and one or both stands down, or there's a fight, and somebody
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   wins.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.960]   And that's the ugliest of all.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.000]   And Mark stood down.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.440]   And that is probably a concession to, "Yes, much of what you say is true," and probably
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.640]   it's a measure of, "I don't think you saw me right."
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.840]   And that's just life.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:03.800]   I mean, Paul and Barnabas couldn't work together because they did not perceive their
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.240]   own flaws.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.200]   Somebody was amiss, and they couldn't see it.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.360]   And I've seen it over and over again.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.880]   It's just one of the heartaches of relationships.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.440]   So a fourth lesson is that biblical leadership structures are not luxuries.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.840]   I think the trend among some megachurches to put in place outside councils with authority
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.960]   that are not based in the elders of the local church is an unbiblical, unwise approach towards
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.560]   church leadership.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.400]   I think the biblical pattern of leadership is that every church should have a team of
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.200]   elders, vocational, non-vocational, all with one vote.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:51.040]   The preaching pastor has greater sway not by having a veto power with all the votes,
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.200]   but by being a wise, thoughtful, exemplary leader.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.760]   As soon as I could, I put in place at Bethlehem a leadership structure that gave me one vote,
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.520]   first among 20, then among 30, then among 40, and that's where it ended.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.600]   I had one vote, which means I could be voted down easily.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.880]   But I never doubted I had great authority at that church, ever, because of the pulpit
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.440]   and because I tried to be a teacher leader.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.120]   I tried to lead with truth, not with official constraints.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.760]   I never wanted to use office or political power to get my way.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.040]   I wanted people to be persuaded.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.760]   So I think structure really matters, and there are a lot of—I don't know if it's a lot,
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.080]   but there are some megachurches today that I think are going off in an unwise direction.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:46.440]   Fifth lesson, I think there is a lesson here about money and salaries of pastors.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:53.160]   I think it is a huge mistake to view pastors as corporate executives with huge salaries
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:59.560]   in the two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight hundred thousand dollar range.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:06.880]   That to me is a clear danger signal that the elders and the pastor have their heart in
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.200]   the wrong place.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:15.320]   I don't know Mark Driscoll's salary, but I think that the corporate mindset was too prominent,
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.880]   and so the warning to us stands.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:26.760]   Sixth lesson—I've got eight of these—there is a lesson how the same theology, Reformed
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:35.560]   or Arminian, on paper can coexist with very different personalities and leadership styles
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.560]   and sins.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:43.560]   There is no theology on paper or merely in preaching that keeps a man from sin.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:49.360]   Peter's withdrawal from eating with the Gentiles in Galatians 2 was sin, and it was not owing
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.160]   to a defective theology.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:58.480]   Paul said very clearly in verse 14, "I saw that their conduct was not in step with the
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.480]   truth."
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.040]   And he means the very truth they believed.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.520]   Human beings don't live up to their theology.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:12.920]   Therefore, when a person falters in their behavior, it is a mistake to jump immediately
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:20.600]   without wider considerations to, "Oh, defective theology," because there are sinners and some
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.200]   serious ones in every branch of theology.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.440]   So Peter knew the truth, and he didn't walk in it, and that's always a possibility with
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.200]   whatever truth is at stake.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:41.640]   And Mark Driscoll has done much good in speaking and writing much truth.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.680]   Thousands of people really have been saved and really have been built up in biblical
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:54.840]   gospel truth, and those people should not question their salvation or their truth just
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.240]   because he might in some cases have walked out of step with the truth.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.920]   Seventh lesson, God's kingdom and his saving purposes in the world are never dependent
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.700]   on one man or one church or one denomination.
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.720]   God is God, and his kingdom is coming, and no one can stop it, and his Word is not bound.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.240]   And the last lesson I thought of was, "Let him who thinks that he stand, take heed lest
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.840]   he fall.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:28.000]   Restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, lest you too be tempted," Paul said.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.040]   I think it would be sinful and unbiblical for any of Mark's detractors to simply feel
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.040]   good riddance.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.080]   That's a sin to feel that.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:46.560]   So we pray for truth to hold sway and for grace to transform and renew and restore all
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.920]   of us, including Mark.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.640]   Yes, there are valuable and humbling lessons for all of us in this.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.360]   And we return tomorrow to tackle another delicate subject of whether or not it's wise for Christians
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.360]   to watch beheading videos coming out of the Middle East.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.280]   The phenomenon, of course, is not new, but the grotesque videos and pictures are being
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.680]   used as strategic propaganda today like never before.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.680]   So that's tomorrow.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.680]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.680]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   you
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   you
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   you
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   you
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
