[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.900]   We begin with, let's see, Tim in New York.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.740]   Tim, welcome to the show.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.220]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.020]   - Hi, Joshua, thanks for taking my call.
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.240]   Just wanted to let you know I really appreciate what you do,
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.740]   and the values you espouse are really aligned with mine,
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.500]   and I really appreciate all the advice that you give.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.340]   And I was recently listening to your Spousal Liberty show.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.500]   It was, I don't know, a week or two ago.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.540]   And you said something that really struck me,
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.420]   which was you didn't know what you would do
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.820]   had you married a doctor.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.980]   And then you also mentioned, I took some notes here,
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.380]   so you said family works best
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.860]   with one large productive career
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.220]   and one family facilitator.
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.740]   And you also mentioned that you didn't think,
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.020]   you didn't think it was possible to own a business
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.420]   and care for young children.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.020]   On its face, I would tend to agree
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.500]   with pretty much all of that,
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.800]   and I happen to be in that situation.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.780]   We are mid-30s.
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.820]   We have three kids under five
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.000]   in a private Christian school right now.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.820]   I don't know how much you would wanna know necessarily
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.380]   about me without knowing my topic,
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.680]   so I'll get right to that.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.140]   My wife, like I said, is a doctor,
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.700]   and she was recently let go
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.380]   from an associateship that she was in.
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.340]   She was making probably 175-ish,
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.140]   but she's been in about four
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.660]   of these associateships agreements
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.220]   in the last nine years or so,
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.180]   all of them being about part-time,
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.620]   between two and a half days to four days a week.
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.020]   And she's just been treated really poorly
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.860]   by the owners of these practices
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.780]   that have really taken advantage of her,
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.300]   and even this latest one could result
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.300]   in some legal issues that we're gonna pursue.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.820]   And she's just sick of being
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.980]   like a second-class doctor basically
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.920]   and having to ask permission
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.860]   or being second-guessed on things.
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.460]   And so when she, last month she was forced to resign,
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.460]   and she started second-guessing her career choice
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.160]   and I guess her vocation as a mom and as a working mom.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.740]   And I would say that since we've been married,
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.540]   our priorities have kind of changed,
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.460]   less about focusing on careers
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.220]   and more about raising good, solid Christian children.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.860]   So we do a lot of volunteering in church and whatnot.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.340]   And after she was terminated,
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.100]   I don't know if it was a knee-jerk reaction,
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.900]   but she said something about,
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.700]   "Maybe I should homeschool the kids."
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.540]   And then a couple of days later,
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.780]   she was back to looking at buying a practice.
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.100]   So she's kind of gone back and forth,
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.620]   and I think now she's less in the homeschooling mindset
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.800]   and more in the, "I just wanna work for myself" mindset.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.060]   And so I'm kind of letting these things
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.060]   settle a little bit before we make a really big decision
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.780]   that's gonna affect the rest of our lives.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.180]   And then I heard your show a couple of weeks ago.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.180]   And so I guess I'm looking for maybe to have you expand on,
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:16.720]   you said you don't know what you'd do
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.780]   if you married a doctor.
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.020]   Well, I did.
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.580]   I work, I have a W-2 job.
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.220]   She's been an independent contractor,
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.820]   so she's been a 1099,
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.220]   which is nice because we can take advantage
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.580]   of some of the tax breaks and whatnot.
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.180]   So it's worked well to have one W-2.
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.400]   I collect all the benefits from my employer.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.500]   I work from home.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.940]   I don't work more than 40 hours.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.100]   It's a nice fit.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.940]   - Good.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.860]   - But then she makes twice as much as me in half the time.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.700]   - Sure, sure.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.780]   - It, so I'm sorry, I went on a long time.
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.020]   So I'll let you share if you have any thoughts.
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.540]   - Yeah, so first of all, how much is your income?
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.820]   - It's about 90,000.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.900]   I knew you'd ask this.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.500]   So I also thought about total compensation
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.540]   because she doesn't get any of the benefits that I get
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.020]   that we would otherwise have to pay for.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.340]   So I have a pretty generous pension through my employer.
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.340]   I have a 401k matching, a lot of vacation time,
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.260]   so, and health insurance, of course.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.940]   So I estimate the total compensation to be around 120.
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.820]   - That's great.
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.820]   And it's a blessing that you're able
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.340]   to work from home as well.
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.380]   You have said three children under five.
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.620]   So all of your children then are in daycare
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.180]   or one of them is in--
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.700]   - Five are under, I'm sorry.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.620]   One is kindergarten.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.820]   - Okay, one is kindergarten.
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.660]   - And then pre-K.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.060]   - Yeah.
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.820]   Well, I'll share with you my thoughts
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.820]   and we can talk about it, but there's not gonna be,
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.940]   let's work it through.
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.860]   So here's where I would like to begin.
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.260]   What bothers me intensely
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.820]   in many financial planning conversations,
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.980]   including on a topic like this,
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.020]   is people start with the numbers involved.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.700]   And they start by saying,
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.220]   well, you've gotta do the thing that is most profitable.
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.060]   And I simply reject that.
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.120]   I think that you do need to consider numbers,
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.500]   but I don't think that money and money alone
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.440]   is a very good criteria to really make
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.940]   almost any decision in life.
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.460]   At least not in my worldview and not in yours either.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.540]   There are many things that I could do
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.060]   that would make a lot of money
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.780]   that I simply would not do because the price is too high.
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.860]   Whether those, and there's things that I could do
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.860]   that don't make a little bit, that just make some money
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.940]   that I would not do because the price is too high.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.420]   And for me, I'm always going to prioritize people.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.380]   In my worldview, people are the most important things.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.380]   You mentioned that you guys are both Christians.
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.880]   Well, let's start there.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.700]   Jesus said, "Do not lay up for yourselves
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.500]   "treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.960]   "and where thieves break in and steal,
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.400]   "but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.540]   "where moth and rust do not destroy
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.240]   "and where thieves cannot break in and steal.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.220]   "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.220]   Now, I've pondered that verse and that teaching
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.940]   and many others that Jesus taught about money.
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.660]   I've pondered that for years.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.300]   And as I've considered it, I've asked myself,
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.140]   how do you store up treasures in heaven?
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.140]   Let me ask you, Tim.
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.020]   How do you, if I say to you,
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.660]   how do you store up treasures in heaven?
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.020]   What's your answer to that?
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.180]   - I would say the way that we, at church,
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.780]   I mean, we donate to the church, we donate to the poor,
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.760]   we donate our time in leading ministry.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:52.860]   I would say those are probably the primary ways.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.940]   - Good.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.980]   So, I'll share my answer and I'll do it
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.900]   just simply with one simple thing.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.660]   When I think about storing up treasures in heaven,
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.820]   well, I can't do that with gold, right?
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.260]   Streets are paid with gold, gold doesn't matter, right?
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.620]   Obviously, it's a metaphor,
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.580]   but gold and silver are not eternal.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.100]   They're physical substances.
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.660]   They're not immaterial and eternal.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.260]   The only thing that I know of that is immaterial
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.000]   and eternal is a soul, a living soul.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.940]   Souls are the only things that are immaterial and eternal.
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.940]   God himself is immaterial and eternal,
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.100]   and he's given man a soul.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.460]   A soul is an immaterial, eternal entity
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.500]   that goes on forever.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.740]   So, if you wanna store up treasures in heaven,
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.320]   the only way I know how to do that is to invest in souls,
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.020]   because souls are the only thing
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.020]   that actually goes from here to there.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:56.420]   And then, one of the basic ways to do that
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:02.020]   is to take money and invest it into people.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.540]   I always think about another teaching of Jesus,
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.940]   where Jesus said, in the book of Luke,
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.460]   he said, "I tell you, make friends for yourselves
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.580]   "by means of unrighteous wealth,
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.460]   "so that when it fails, they may receive you
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.940]   "into eternal dwellings."
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.780]   Now, obviously, Jesus is talking about that
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:23.740]   in the context of the parable of the dishonest manager,
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.580]   but it's just something that I always think about.
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.020]   Different translation says,
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.680]   "Use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourself,
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.660]   "so that when it is gone,
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.220]   "you'll be welcomed into eternal dwellings."
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.420]   Now, again, I'm pulling that a little out of context,
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.900]   'cause it's in the context of a parable,
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.100]   but I think the thought is there,
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.300]   and just in the point that I make.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.900]   Say, okay, what is the point of money?
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.540]   The point of money is to invest it into people.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.540]   And so, when I die, and when you die,
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.960]   we leave exactly the same amount of money behind
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.300]   as everyone else, all of it.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.740]   And we're only stewards of it
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.060]   for a temporary period of time.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.860]   So, I'm always going to prioritize people above finance.
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:04.540]   I'm always gonna prioritize souls more than gold coins,
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.020]   or digits on a digital balance sheet.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.160]   That's my basic and simple philosophy.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.380]   So, when we come to something like a job,
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.300]   and you think about your children,
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.180]   and your family, and your community,
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.940]   this applies across the board.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.520]   So, if we use the ethic that I'm going to invest money
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.940]   and lay up treasures in heaven, not on the earth,
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.140]   then that's going to give a good guiding principle
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.980]   to many decisions.
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.200]   So, for example, I'm not going to engage in a career
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.300]   or business choice that is destructive to people.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.100]   So, perhaps I could go, and I could become a multimillionaire
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.700]   by fomenting wars around the world,
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.180]   and using those wars to create a demand for me
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.740]   to sell arms to the war efforts,
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.900]   and to the people who are prosecuting those wars.
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.140]   But I'm not gonna do that,
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.500]   because that results in the destruction of souls
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.220]   rather than the betterment of souls.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.340]   I'd rather have a very small business
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.340]   that actually served people,
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.440]   more than have a big business that was destructive
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.880]   to society and destructive to people's souls.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.020]   We can pivot to our family, and I could say,
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.340]   well, there are a lot of things that I could do
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.460]   that would make a lot of money.
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.980]   There are things that I could do that would be illegal,
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.140]   that would make money.
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.020]   And not only would some of those things be destructive,
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.260]   but the risk of doing something illegal is simply too high,
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.160]   because perhaps I could make a million dollars this year
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.900]   doing something illegal.
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.940]   But the risk is that I'm going to be imprisoned
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.660]   for my activities, and I'm gonna spend the next 20 years
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.340]   in prison and not be able to be of any use to my children.
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.700]   So I'm obviously not gonna do anything illegal.
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.060]   In addition, we could go to,
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.980]   what about something that's very high paid,
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.500]   but would take me away from my family?
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.580]   Perhaps I could go and work as a military contractor
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.780]   overseas, hire myself out as a mercenary,
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:52.780]   make a lot of money working
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.820]   for a private contracting company.
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.120]   Yeah, but that takes me away from my children.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.760]   And it takes me away from my children, from my family.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.720]   I leave them.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.720]   And could there be times
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.160]   where you have to do something like that?
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.560]   Yeah, of course, right?
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.300]   Throughout history, men have gone away to war.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.960]   And if it's necessary, if your home is being threatened
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.000]   by somebody, you might have to go away and fight and say,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.720]   I'm sorry, I'll be back on the other side of the war.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.760]   That might be.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.800]   But I'm not gonna make a decision like that intentionally,
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.480]   because I know that the havoc
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.260]   that that would wreak in my children
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.180]   and in my family and in my community.
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.440]   And so all of these examples are simply trying to say
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.300]   that you're never gonna get me to start by saying,
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.800]   the only thing that matters is the most profitable.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.760]   It's simply not.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.340]   All the money is disposable.
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.220]   It's all gonna be eventually burned up.
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.340]   And so it's simply a temporary tool for a time.
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.660]   But what's the most important
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.680]   is the souls of people involved.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.820]   So that's my basic guiding ethic,
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.860]   that money matters, but it's not the most important thing.
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.140]   So now we come back to a situation
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.900]   such as you're wrestling with.
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.260]   How do we, as parents, build a godly family
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.220]   that will stand the test of time?
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.140]   Well, that's not an easy question to answer.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.900]   There's a lot of things that are associated with that.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.180]   But I'm gonna use that ethic, and I'm gonna say,
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.660]   I'm gonna begin by deciding
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.860]   what's in the best interest of our family.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.760]   And we're gonna take into account
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.320]   what's in my best interest as the husband and father,
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.360]   what's in my wife's best interest as the mother and wife,
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.480]   what's in our children's best interest,
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.800]   and what's in the best interest
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.240]   of our family collectively together.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.060]   And I'm gonna try to build an ideal vision
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.840]   from that position.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.800]   And then once we're clear on what we think
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.120]   is in our best interest, what we think is the ideal,
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.480]   what we think is the best way for us to invest in souls,
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.940]   then now, as I see it, we pivot,
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.620]   and we look at the finances, and we say,
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:58.420]   in light of our vision, how can we make the finances fit?
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.740]   In light of our vision, how can we make the finances fit?
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:08.180]   And then we go with what,
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.620]   and we ask God for wisdom in that situation.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.260]   And we consider different options,
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.580]   we consider different solutions,
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.980]   we consider the benefits and the disadvantages
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.760]   of different parts of that,
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.240]   and then we go from there.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.120]   Now, the challenges, so do you agree with me so far
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.640]   in my method of analysis here, Tim?
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.480]   - Yes, mm-hmm.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.240]   - Okay, so at this point in time,
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.160]   what we've accomplished, we've accomplished a basic ethic,
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.200]   a basic framework, and now the challenge comes to,
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.960]   well, how do we know what's in the best interest
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.200]   of our children?
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   So how do we know whether or not your wife
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.400]   working as a doctor and doing this,
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.580]   how do we know if that's better for our family,
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.340]   for her to make an extra $175,000 a year
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.020]   by being away from the family for 60 hours a week,
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.460]   or if it's better for our family
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.800]   to not have that extra $175,000,
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.980]   and just simply being with the family?
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:09.940]   How do we know?
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.340]   How do we know if it's better for you, go ahead.
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.740]   - I was just gonna say, I know we already talked
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:20.180]   about the dollar figure doesn't necessarily matter,
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.980]   but there's a pretty big difference
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.680]   between what she's thinking of pursuing now,
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.460]   which would be purchasing a practice,
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.220]   and what she was making as an associate.
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.140]   It would probably be double.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.860]   We're probably looking at over $300,000,
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.100]   to the point where maybe I could go part-time.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.300]   Just an option, just things that we're bouncing around.
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.020]   - Sure, fair enough.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:47.020]   So I honestly don't know how I could solve the question.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.220]   I don't know how it's possible for someone
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.660]   who's not in the middle of the family,
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.180]   because there are a lot of things that you've gotta balance.
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.660]   Number one is you've gotta take an accurate look
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.860]   at your earning ability.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.100]   It could be that you're choosing to earn something
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.720]   where you're making $90,000 per year,
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.380]   because of the things that it gives you,
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.380]   but you could go and do something
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.260]   to making $400,000 a year.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.060]   And so I would talk about with my wife,
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.180]   and I would say, "Well, what if I were making $400,000
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.140]   "a year, what would we do then?"
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.180]   It could be, on the other hand,
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.820]   that you don't have that capability.
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.740]   Maybe you are untrained, maybe you are just simply
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.060]   not capable of earning a significant income,
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.860]   in which case everything changes.
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.340]   You need to look at, talk about your ambitions,
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.780]   your career ambitions, your family ambitions.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.020]   Then you'd talk to your wife.
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.340]   Take a good, solid look at her life, her lifestyle,
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.620]   her ambitions, her career ambitions,
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.220]   the time and the structure for the family.
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.180]   Talk about what's given up.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.560]   One way, if she stays home and is a stay-at-home mom,
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.140]   if she works as a part-time doc,
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.860]   just doing another associate thing,
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.780]   if she does her own business and buys her own practice
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.780]   and sets that up, talking about that.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.380]   I think it's important to discuss
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.720]   the impact on the children.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:08.220]   If I could have a magic wand and wave a magic wand
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.900]   over the entire universe, I would have every dad
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.180]   and every mom as full-time moms and dads,
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.380]   perfectly together with their children
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.100]   for the first five to 10 years of life.
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.460]   In my opinion, that's probably the best solution.
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.620]   Now, I do think that that should be done
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.660]   in the context of work.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.140]   I think it's really healthy to have work and jobs
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.540]   that children can engage with together,
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.220]   but I think stay-at-home moms and stay-at-home dads,
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.220]   and for those years, it is incredible.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:44.300]   I wouldn't give up, I can't imagine the amount of money
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:49.300]   that, there's no amount of money that I would give up
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.740]   and trade for the lifestyle
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.260]   that my wife and I enjoy right now.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.940]   We're with our children 168 hours a week, both of us.
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.700]   I guess 167 or 166.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.460]   We do try to put them into some classes and things
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.660]   where they have to be with a teacher
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.100]   and a homeschool co-op, things like that.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.980]   But beyond that, we're with our children
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.700]   practically all the time.
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.900]   Now, I don't think that's a mandatory number
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.220]   that dads and moms have to be together with their children
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.100]   for 168 hours a week
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.660]   in order to raise successful children, nonsense.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.960]   But it is really nice.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.980]   And when I think about what would I buy with the money,
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.020]   what would you buy with the money?
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.900]   What would change in your lifestyle
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:32.420]   if your wife makes $350,000 instead of 175
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.700]   or in terms instead of zero?
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.500]   Well, we could talk about that.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.540]   Basically, you'll have more money faster.
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.900]   So you become financially independent faster.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.480]   You'll start consuming more.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.500]   You'll have a bigger house.
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.980]   You'll have nicer cars.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.220]   You'll be able to put the children into nicer things,
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.480]   fancier camps, fancier schools, et cetera.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:56.020]   To me, none of those things are nearly as appealing
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.580]   as having a strong family.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.780]   If I had to trade them,
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.460]   and I don't think you have to necessarily.
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.380]   I'm a little tongue-tied
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.100]   just because I'm trying to be very respectful
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.580]   of the fact that you're not me.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.340]   So I'm just speaking from my position
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.260]   and trying to be also very respectful of the fact
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.580]   that what we're dealing with here
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.340]   is one of the most sensitive, intimate types of decisions
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.220]   that a family can wrestle through.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.060]   And it's tough.
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.520]   It's difficult.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.400]   But all I can say is that I can't think of anything
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.140]   that I would wanna buy with money
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.220]   that would make it worth my giving up
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.580]   those early years of my children's life.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.940]   And so if my wife were in that situation,
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.300]   I would say, "Listen, honey, let's keep you current.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.780]   "Keep your licenses current.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.180]   "Keep your skills current.
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.580]   "You can stay current on knowledge.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.380]   "Let's try to find some way
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:47.380]   "that you can indulge your interest in this area.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:52.260]   "Let's find some way that you can maybe be a researcher.
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.620]   "Instead of being a practitioner,
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.620]   "is there something that you can do as a researcher
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.660]   "that's not gonna subject you to the daily stress
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.780]   "of being at your practice 40 hours a week
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.780]   "just to make money that we don't necessarily need?"
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.780]   Just so what?
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:11.460]   So we can buy bigger cars and a fancier house?
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.820]   How are we ever gonna get back the time with our children?
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.820]   How are we ever gonna get back the relationship
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.180]   that is cemented in those early years?
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.140]   And I would say, "Why don't we look for a way
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.580]   "that you can stay current with your skills, your career,
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:29.340]   "and exercise it in a way that allows you to be a mom?"
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.220]   Because you'll never get back...
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:36.220]   See, as I look at it, your wife will never get back
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.700]   the first five years of her children's life.
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:44.180]   She can always go and work five more years in a career.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.300]   And so why not just simply do whatever's needed
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.820]   to keep her training current, her licenses current, et cetera,
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:56.820]   but focus on the irreplaceable thing of the family
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.940]   during these years that you never get back,
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.820]   and then plan to practice medicine for longer.
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.660]   It just doesn't seem to me, from my worldview,
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.220]   it just doesn't, more money doesn't seem worth it
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.900]   if it comes at a cost to a family.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.020]   Now, my point would be, however,
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.860]   that what I would try to do is I would try to find
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.000]   a third solution that doesn't come
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.660]   with a cost to the family.
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.780]   And so maybe that third solution
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.900]   is that she works two days a week,
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.320]   and that way she has enough time with the family,
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.080]   but then you're available in the other two days a week,
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.980]   or you find a really good solution for the children
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.400]   that's not just full-time them out there.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.540]   Or maybe she becomes a researcher and a writer,
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.220]   and that's something that in her research and her writing,
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.980]   she can do while she's with the children,
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.980]   or you can do together as a team.
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.140]   Maybe you build a family business where you work together.
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.380]   Those are the kinds of solutions that I'm always drawn to,
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.580]   because I like to make money.
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.380]   I like to make money, and I think it's fun.
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.780]   I think having nice cars and big houses
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.000]   and being able to afford cool things
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.960]   for the children is fun.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.620]   And if you have the ability to do that,
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.920]   then I say go for it.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.400]   But I'm never gonna do it if it costs me something.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.440]   I'm never gonna go for the money
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.220]   if it costs me something that I can't get back.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.200]   So I don't know exactly how to do it,
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.560]   but that's what I would be looking for,
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.880]   is I would talk about it,
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.920]   I would discuss and discern what's best for our children,
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.700]   and then I would try to make a plan through it
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.840]   that allows us to get some of each thing.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.920]   So if she works a couple days a week,
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.300]   but she makes $100,000 a year,
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.920]   I mean, that's more money than you need.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.440]   And if you're there in the house
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.280]   the two days that she's working, then that's fine, right?
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.040]   It's not like 168 hours has to be the absolute standard,
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.080]   but trying to navigate through it in some way
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.000]   where we recognize that you will never get this time
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.920]   and relationship with your children back.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.880]   And the only thing that you get in exchange
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.920]   for going to the workforce is more money.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.080]   Well, what do you need the money for?
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.200]   And as long as we prioritize the children
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.400]   as being really important,
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.000]   and we don't prioritize the money
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.840]   as being supremely important,
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.460]   then I'm confident that you can make the best decision
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.380]   for your family based upon the circumstances
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.660]   that you actually face.
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:18.120]   - Yeah.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.680]   Yeah, I appreciate that perspective.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.760]   I mean, I probably have thought of it that way,
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.280]   but never, I don't think I've heard it.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.600]   Verbalize that way.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.560]   - I'm gonna interrupt you just for a moment.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.080]   The thing that obviously gets me going
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.480]   is what bothers me substantially
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.540]   is that in our modern world,
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:44.440]   the basic criteria that people use for everything is money.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.560]   And they measure everything in terms of dollar earning.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.940]   And this is especially damaging to women
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.580]   because in the wake of the feminist revolution,
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.640]   the first and second wave feminists
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.080]   looked to a career and to earning an income
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.340]   as a primary metric of proving equality
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.600]   and or superiority with men.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.540]   And so what has happened is that many times,
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:13.320]   many women have come to basically analyze themselves
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.480]   and value themselves based upon money.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.480]   Now, certainly men do that as well,
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.320]   but the pressure is intense on women
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.400]   because it's very difficult for many modern women,
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:31.200]   especially young, intelligent, capable women
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.560]   to value themselves based upon something other than money.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.680]   And that's why in the show that you referenced,
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:41.320]   why I used financial kind of calculations
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.640]   to try to demonstrate that many of these things
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.200]   that I value that my wife does
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.080]   can actually be denominated in money.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.680]   But it's stupid to judge everything by money.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.720]   We all know that it's stupid
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.920]   and yet we still do it day after day.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.920]   I don't have worth because of my worth and my worthiness
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.520]   and my value as a person
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.280]   is not based upon how much money I generate.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.360]   My worth and my value as a person
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.560]   is based upon my identity
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.080]   as being an image bearer of God himself.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.760]   That's what makes a slave and a slave master
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.380]   both of equal worth.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.920]   That's what makes an employer and employee
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.400]   both of equal worth.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.360]   That's what makes a ditch digger and a doctor
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.780]   both of equal worth.
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:32.720]   It's the imago dei.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.120]   It's the fact that they are a human
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:38.120]   and as a human, they are fundamentally valuable
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.740]   because of their humanness.
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.560]   We don't judge people and say,
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.720]   well, that doctor over there is a more important person
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.920]   than the ditch digger
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.120]   because the doctor makes more money
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.040]   except in the modern United States of America
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.480]   and the modern capitalist system
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.160]   where we basically prefer the rich over the poor
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.520]   and we bow down to the rich
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.400]   and we bow down to the people who have all the money
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.480]   and we neglect the people who are poor
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.920]   because of this corrupt standard.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.200]   Now, I'm fine with making money.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.640]   I want there to be a,
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.640]   I want there to be all of us
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:15.040]   to achieve to our maximum potential,
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.080]   to grow as much as possible.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.680]   And I want all of us to earn as much money as possible
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.320]   in a free market, non-coercive, capitalist society.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.520]   Money is one way that we can assess the value that's brought
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.880]   not to everything, but to many things in life.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.120]   And so it's useful.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.600]   It's a good metric and it's a good barometer,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.320]   but it cannot be the primary ethic that we judge people by.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:44.320]   I cannot prefer the rich man and ignore the poor man
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.080]   just because it's rich and poor.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.400]   That's immoral.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.920]   That's absolutely immoral.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.000]   And so what happens is that in the modern society,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.800]   because of the inability of people to think ethically
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.120]   and to appreciate somebody for their value
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.960]   and their worth and their dignity as a human,
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.000]   and then to appreciate the full scope
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.440]   of their value as a human,
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.800]   everything just comes down to how much money you make.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.480]   And it's the thinnest, stupidest metric to ever use
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.240]   to judge a person's value.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.380]   It's a useful metric for yourself
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.380]   if you're working in a career where you can say,
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:27.400]   I'm making more money because I've served more people.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:31.000]   I track how much money I make because I believe my goal
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.160]   is to serve more people and to serve them more effectively.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.560]   And one objective metric that I can use
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.560]   is how much money am I earning?
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.560]   Because in order for me to earn more money,
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.880]   I have to serve more people
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.800]   and serve people more effectively.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.760]   But it's just one metric among many
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.120]   that I need to use to track my success.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.320]   And it's a very clumsy metric.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.320]   So I don't know how to break through to a broken society
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.120]   that prefers the rich and denigrates the poor
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.000]   and doesn't esteem people based upon their worth as human
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.620]   other than to use the extreme examples.
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.200]   We all know that when you sit down and write your eulogy,
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.080]   you don't sit down and say,
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.040]   and imagine that your best friend is gonna say,
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.820]   well, Joshua Sheets made $450,000 per year.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.540]   It's absurd, it's stupid.
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.640]   You know that there's a non-financial quality
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.240]   that you want someone to talk about.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:27.060]   And so to the extent that you can achieve
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.540]   those non-financial qualities and the financial benefits,
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.840]   go for it.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.920]   But if it ever costs me a non-financial quality
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.080]   to have a financial benefit, price is too high.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.960]   Money can always, you can always get more money.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.080]   Money is the ultimate replaceable resource,
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.560]   the ultimate renewable resource.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.320]   And it's one of the, once you get over a certain point,
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.460]   it's one of the least impactful.
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.280]   And that's another point to drive home for you.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.520]   Let's say that you were disabled, Tim.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.480]   You couldn't work, okay?
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.160]   You're disabled.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.440]   Would your situation in your household be fairly easy
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.240]   to figure out the right thing to do?
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.440]   - Yeah. - Be obvious, right?
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.600]   You can't work.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.840]   Your wife has to work
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.600]   and she has to support the household.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.560]   And so she would do everything she could
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.080]   to be effective as a mother and as a wife,
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.600]   but she has to go and she has to earn an income.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   And you're gonna do everything you can
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:28.600]   to fulfill her role, to be a dad
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.800]   to the extent of your physical capabilities
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.520]   and to love your children.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.880]   But you're not in that situation.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.580]   You're in a situation where you could live
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.600]   perfectly well on your income.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.640]   You could live perfectly well on her income.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.840]   And so it's much harder for you guys.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.160]   So just recognize that.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:49.320]   We're not talking here about somebody who's destitute.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.960]   Your income is almost double the median income
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.800]   in the United States of America.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.200]   Her income is quadrupled to quintuple the median income
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.720]   in the United States of America.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.800]   So this is a real first world rich person problem.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.820]   And thus you'll have to talk about the solutions.
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.400]   Look at your children, see what needs your children are,
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.600]   consider what your visions are as a family,
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.840]   how they're performing, how they're thriving,
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.040]   and come to a solution together.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.520]   My only plea with you is that you don't consider money
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.100]   until after you consider what you believe as a family
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.660]   is best for your children and best for your family.
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:32.900]   - Great, yeah, we will certainly do that.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.240]   - Let me ask you, let me pivot it, okay,
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.840]   to try to put this home in the most graphic way that I can.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:46.200]   Let's say that, let's say that,
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:51.360]   both for your wife, let's say that she starts this business
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.880]   and she makes a net income of $300,000
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:58.280]   for the next five years, right?
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.560]   $300,000 for the next five years.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.940]   She earns a million and a half dollars
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.220]   over the next five years.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.200]   But for some reason, and I don't think
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.560]   that there is this there, I'm just trying to prove
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.880]   my point about priority of importance.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.660]   For some reason, because of the fact
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.080]   that she's starting this new business
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.400]   and making all this money,
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.360]   it costs the life of your youngest child.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.560]   And five years from now, your child is dead.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.480]   Would you do the, would you earn the $1.5 million?
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.600]   Or would you save the life of your child?
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.440]   - Certainly not.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.640]   - Right, nobody would.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.840]   Now, no, we're not, obviously,
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.680]   we're not dealing in a situation where
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.120]   putting your child in daycare is gonna kill 'em.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.040]   No, it's not.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.480]   But if you start with what's best for my child,
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:53.140]   if you wouldn't suffer the death of your child
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:58.140]   to earn $1.5 million, what about the success of your child?
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:02.460]   So would $1.5 million be worth it
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:05.920]   if your child achieved at a slightly less rate
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.760]   than they possibly could achieve?
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.120]   Or would perhaps, let's say that we're just measuring
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.080]   in terms of relationship, and the possible relationship
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.360]   that you could have with your children
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.800]   and that your wife could have with your children,
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.400]   the possible family dynamics that you could have
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:25.280]   as a family are a level of a 10.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.440]   But if you go and you earn the $1.5 million,
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.760]   it's gonna reduce the quality of your family life
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.400]   to a six.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.020]   But that six is gonna go throughout life.
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:38.360]   So maybe you could have really loving relationships,
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.340]   you could have intimate relationships
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.640]   where there's total peace and total happiness,
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:48.060]   and you have a rich relationship of respect
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.400]   and of love with your children, and that's a 10.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.820]   You play with this however you want,
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.020]   but just aim out what the 10 is.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.220]   And then say, well, instead of love,
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:02.460]   we could have care, we could have liking.
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:07.460]   And instead of rich respect, we could have toleration.
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:12.580]   Instead of very well-behaved children,
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.620]   we could have children that are sort of behaved,
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.860]   not entirely insubordinate.
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:22.380]   Instead of being able to nurture our children
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:26.180]   and train them in the way they should go in everything,
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:30.260]   we'll have an input level of 20%.
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.520]   Well, fast forward.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.260]   You're 50 years old, your children are adults,
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.140]   you're 60 years old, you're 70 years old.
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:40.980]   And so you achieved results of a six or a seven
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:41.980]   instead of a 10.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.420]   Is that worth $1.5 million?
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.300]   And you don't have to answer,
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.700]   'cause of course that's a very personal question.
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.440]   But that's how I look at it,
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.080]   is that if I know something is ideal,
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.580]   then let me find a way to get something that's ideal.
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.060]   And for me, the reason why children
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:02.020]   and doing the best that I can as a parent is important
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:05.180]   is because there's probably not gonna be
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.140]   that many people in my life
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.180]   who are gonna truly love and support me
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:14.060]   and care for me throughout my entire lifetime.
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.700]   We're all fortunate if at the end of our life,
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.020]   we're sitting there at our funeral,
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.740]   if there's a handful of really true, genuine, good friends,
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.980]   we're fortunate.
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.540]   Now, there might be more attendees at a funeral,
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.820]   but a really good, really close friends are a handful.
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.140]   And I can't guarantee
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.420]   that I'll have those kinds of friends.
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.460]   I can do my best, I wanna be that kind of friend,
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.940]   and in time, they should develop,
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.740]   and I should be able to maintain them through the years.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.820]   But I do know for a fact
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:47.100]   that I want my children to be some of my best friends.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:51.900]   My own father is one of my closest friends.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.320]   Now, we don't have the kind of chummy relationship
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.960]   that I have with other friends,
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.280]   which there's still a respect,
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.080]   but I feel closer to him
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.440]   in terms of my relationship with him
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.140]   than I do with almost anyone else.
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.780]   And with my own mother, the same thing.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.480]   I feel I can share with total honesty
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.400]   and total sincerity and total vulnerability.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.960]   I respect them and I ask for their advice, I care for them.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.160]   And I would sacrifice anything in my life to care for them
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.340]   as they got older, as they get older.
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.840]   And they have that relationship, more or less,
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.960]   with most of my siblings, not all to the same degree,
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.900]   but they have that relationship with more or less.
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.280]   So, you know, one of my sisters is dead,
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.960]   but if you have six children that all care for you,
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.320]   they're your best friends.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.040]   My parents have, I don't know, 16, 17 grandchildren,
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:42.880]   I can't remember.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.360]   Anyway, they have a lot of grandchildren
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.920]   at this point in time.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.720]   And you can build that same relationship
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:48.700]   with your grandchildren.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.700]   And so when you talk about happiness scale
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.900]   and a happiness scale of life,
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.960]   I'm not gonna, if I had to choose
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.500]   between the $1.5 million just so I can,
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:01.820]   I don't know, live in a fancier house,
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.760]   versus having the kind of relationship with my children
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.240]   that I wanna have when they're young
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.920]   and when I have when they're older,
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.480]   and then seeing my children and being proud of who they are
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.600]   and being proud of their character
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.120]   and being proud of how I've trained them
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.040]   and helped them and served them,
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.380]   to me, it's no comparison.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.580]   There's just no,
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:27.140]   the return on money is so thin and easily understood,
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:32.460]   versus the return on investing in people, in children,
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:36.840]   which is so rich and so lifelong
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.220]   that when I imagine my eulogy being said at my children,
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.920]   I don't picture how much money I earned,
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:49.000]   I picture my children delivering that address
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.520]   and talking about the experiences
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.320]   and the way that I impacted their life
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:57.060]   and the way that I modeled a life well lived before them
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.240]   so that they'll take that.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.880]   And my goal is that, my goal is to live such a life,
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.080]   I don't know if I'll achieve this, but this is my goal.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:09.080]   My goal is to live a life that is so inspiring
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.960]   to my children that when my children's children's children
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.700]   are being trained, they'll still look back to my example.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.900]   That's my goal.
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.340]   Now, I don't know if I can achieve it,
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.660]   but I do know that I can't achieve it
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.980]   if I say, well, I'm gonna make money.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.320]   'Cause I can look throughout the world
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.380]   and I can find a whole lot of people
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.620]   who made a whole lot of money,
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.780]   whose children respect their ability to make money,
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.580]   but they don't say, I wanna be just like that.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.420]   And I want my children to say, I wanna be just like that.
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.440]   So I've talked about it, I've ranted about it
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.400]   kind of in every direction that I can come at it,
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.280]   but that to me is why it matters.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.280]   Because the thing that goes into eternity
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.320]   is the souls of people.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.740]   And the people that I have the most opportunity to impact
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.440]   are the souls of my children.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.000]   It's a blessing if I can encourage
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.480]   another couple people, right?
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.960]   I love the fact that I can encourage other people
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.480]   through this podcast.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.920]   I love the fact that I can go
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.680]   and I can encourage my next door neighbor
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.240]   and I can love my neighbor.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.100]   But the people who are the most important in my life,
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.940]   the people who I'm accountable to God for,
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.340]   my wife and my children.
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.960]   And so those are the souls that my job is to impact.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:26.100]   So with as long as that ethic is in place clearly,
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:29.420]   then I believe that thoughtful, godly parents
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.820]   will look at their situation, ask God for wisdom
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.820]   and say, what's best for us and what's best for our children
[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.180]   and make the proper decision.
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.940]   And I believe that those decisions
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.880]   can be different for different people.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.160]   I don't see how I could say to you,
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.480]   here's what you need to do in your situation.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.160]   Your situation might be different than mine
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.820]   and we might make different decisions.
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.720]   But as long as that ethic is there
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.800]   and as long as we have our priorities straight,
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.200]   then as parents, you and your wife
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.100]   will be able to make the best decision for your family,
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.040]   whatever that is.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:04.400]   - Okay, yeah, I really appreciate the insight.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.260]   There's a lot more variables that would take forever
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.540]   to go into and various things that we have to consider
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.360]   before we make a decision either way.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:20.180]   But I mean, you've really reinforced a lot of what
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.220]   I already believe for the most part.
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.060]   - Good, good.
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.020]   And I don't even think necessarily that,
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.380]   especially in a public format like this,
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.780]   I don't think you should even talk about those variables
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:32.900]   publicly because they're personal and they're intimate.
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.880]   They have to do with your dreams, right?
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.640]   Your wife's dreams.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.020]   When I was talking about being married to a doctor,
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.340]   one of the things that I,
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.420]   the reason I feel like I dodged a bullet
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:47.860]   in not winding up in a relationship
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:51.540]   with either of those two girls that I was interested in
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.140]   was because for them,
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.900]   a very important part of their dreams from girlhood,
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.940]   especially one of them, was to be a doctor.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:01.940]   And it was so fundamentally a part of her identity
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.580]   that I can't see how I would ever,
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.300]   the only thing I would,
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.740]   I can't see how I would ever have to be able to
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.260]   or want to kind of interfere with that.
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.980]   It was her girlhood dream.
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.700]   All I would do is I would say,
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.620]   "Lord, if you want her to have another dream
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.140]   "or you want her to change that, you gotta do it."
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.620]   I couldn't open my mouth.
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.300]   And I was talking to my wife about this and I said,
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.020]   the reason is because as a husband, right?
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.140]   One of the things that you do as a husband
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.760]   is you care for your wife.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:36.140]   And part of that means you want your wife to experience
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.940]   the fulfillment of all of her dreams.
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.980]   You want your wife to experience,
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:44.460]   to be richly successful.
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:48.100]   And so you're going to support her.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.380]   And so if I were in that, caught in that situation
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:55.340]   where my wife's dreams involved medicine
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.460]   and that was so deeply important to her,
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:58.660]   it wasn't just a part-time thing.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.280]   It wasn't like, well, okay, it's fine.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.760]   But this was with one of those girls,
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.500]   it's just a fundamental part of her identity.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.620]   What could I do other than say,
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:11.100]   I want you to have what you want and support her in that.
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.940]   But yet what I see now from years down the road
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.180]   that I didn't when I was in that situation
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.740]   was how hard that would have been
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.380]   based upon some of my vision.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.340]   Now, I haven't talked to her in years.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.580]   In time, people change.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.660]   You gotta come to a shared vision.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:29.540]   There's a reason why I'm not married to her.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.960]   But that's the challenge that you're in
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.140]   is you've got to look and say,
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.280]   what's in the best interest of my wife
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.120]   and how do I support her
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.780]   so that she can achieve the things that she wants to do?
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.700]   And then is there a way that we can do this?
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.720]   And we have to do it in a way that's best for our family.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:46.560]   That's my only point.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.020]   We have to do it in a way that's best for our family.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.700]   My closing comment to you,
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:55.060]   if you decide that you can't do a career,
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.660]   if you can't decide that you can't do a big business
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.620]   and also get a 10, which you may be able to,
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:03.980]   I'm not saying you can't,
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.500]   but if you can't also get a 10
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.180]   and feel really confident that you're doing
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.480]   what you believe is in the best interest of your family,
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.940]   just simply remember that careers can always be done.
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:16.020]   There's not anything that's going to fundamentally change
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:20.860]   about the need for doctors five years from now
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.100]   or 10 years from now.
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.340]   And the time horizon that you have with children
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.340]   is so short.
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.460]   You basically have, you have a few years.
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.300]   If you go and you study
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.020]   the early child development statistics,
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:37.140]   the vast majority of a child's vocabulary
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.000]   is formed within the first few years.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.740]   The person who teaches a child vocabulary
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.740]   teaches them how to think.
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.120]   The vast majority of a child's character
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.740]   is established within the first few years.
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.180]   And then it's not the vast majority,
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:53.020]   but a huge amount of the child's personality,
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:54.820]   character, and basic habits
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.780]   and things like ability to learn, manners, et cetera,
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:01.660]   those are all very early childhood things.
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:05.460]   By the time you get to a child who's seven, eight, nine, 10,
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:09.660]   there's not a lot that's gonna change for that person.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.740]   And then once they reach that,
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.540]   they learn a different style of learning
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.700]   where they can learn to do self-learning,
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:16.620]   where they can read a book and say,
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.920]   "Okay, I'm gonna change this thing about myself."
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.900]   The most important thing in those early years
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:25.140]   is the behavior that's modeled by mom and dad,
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.100]   the way that mom and dad speak,
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.780]   the language that you speak,
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:32.780]   the accent that you use or don't use,
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.120]   the type of words that you use,
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.540]   the type of concepts that you speak about.
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.580]   And it's not really anything that can be done
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:40.940]   except naturally.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:42.660]   And so that's my great fear,
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.140]   is often that people underappreciate
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.760]   how important just the physical presence is
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.580]   with mom and dad to observe how they live their life
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.860]   and to observe what we as a family do
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.460]   and what we as a family don't do.
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:58.420]   And they wind up outsourcing that most important task
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:02.100]   to a person who is often poorly paid
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.660]   and is not necessarily chosen
[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:07.660]   based upon the character that they have
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:09.300]   and the values that they have, et cetera.
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.340]   Now, you can do this better,
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:13.180]   Christian school versus non-Christian school,
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:17.680]   choosing an elite daycare versus a run-of-the-mill daycare.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:22.420]   But that's why those early years are so important.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.380]   But it's a very narrow window of time.
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.460]   10-year-old, you could put a 10-year-old in a school
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:28.060]   and it can thrive, right?
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.660]   Two-year-old, I'm not convinced.
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.980]   So one way or the other,
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:36.660]   may God give you wisdom in your situation
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:41.900]   to decide what's best for your family.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:43.460]   But that's how I see the world.
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.780]   Anything else, Tim? - I appreciate that.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:47.300]   Thank you.
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:48.140]   No, that's it.
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.180]   Thank you so much.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.460]   - All right, well, quite the interesting call there.
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:53.540]   Tim was our only caller for today,
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.140]   so I'll just wrap up the Q&A show with that.
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:58.200]   My only point, and I hope that,
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:02.220]   I don't need to say it again, I've been clear enough.
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.300]   Prioritize people.
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.340]   I'm convinced that if you prioritize people,
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:09.300]   they're souls, right?
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.200]   The importance of a soul, the inestimable value.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:16.780]   Prioritize people from the earliest of ages to the oldest.
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.700]   If you prioritize people, you'll never go wrong.
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.900]   You may not be as rich as you would otherwise be
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:27.060]   in financial wealth, but I'm convinced you'll be far richer
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.360]   in the things that matter.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:35.420]   I always, when I was younger, I traveled alone sometimes.
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:37.500]   And some people like to travel alone.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.380]   There are things that are nice about it.
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.860]   I think that, you know, as a parent of four,
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:46.740]   I have to admit that sometimes when I travel alone,
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.340]   you think, wow, this is nice, right?
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:49.580]   I can just come and go.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:50.980]   I can go to a restaurant and just sit down
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:51.820]   and order what I want.
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.740]   I don't have to order five meals.
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.900]   There are some nice things.
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:56.820]   But one of the things I learned when I was young
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:00.700]   is traveling alone, I just assumed not travel.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.300]   It wasn't interesting to me.
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.240]   I remember one time I took a trip,
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:07.480]   doesn't matter where,
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.580]   I just learned that I didn't wanna travel alone.
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.540]   And I've seen again and again and again
[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.260]   how when you have something nice,
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.020]   you wanna share it with someone.
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.100]   If you have a nice car,
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.460]   I get joy from sharing something nice.
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:22.740]   If I have a nice fishing rod,
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.980]   I'm not the kind of guy that enjoys going out in a boat
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:26.300]   and saying, look, I got a fancy boat
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:27.740]   and a fancy fishing rod.
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.140]   I'm the kind of guy who wants a boat full of people
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.440]   and a bunch of people having fun.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.420]   That's where I derive my joy from.
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:37.660]   And I've always used those pictures as being pretty clear.
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:41.760]   If I had to choose between a $50,000 bass boat
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.760]   that I'm in alone versus a $500 John boat
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:51.500]   that I got a couple of friends out there with me,
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.620]   I'll take the John boat and the friends.
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:56.200]   And so I think that for me at least,
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.000]   it's a pretty powerful metaphor between life and money.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.880]   It's fun to have money to buy big fancy boats
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.760]   and take your friends on fun adventures.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.840]   It's fun.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.680]   And I'm all for it.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.640]   I think you can do it.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.160]   I think you can do it without sacrificing
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.440]   the things that are at home.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.240]   But if I have to choose between them,
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.780]   I'm gonna choose people over money every time.
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:21.200]   And I believe that if you think about the people
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.920]   that you respect and admire,
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:27.500]   they probably exhibit that character as well.
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:30.680]   Well, if you and I are gonna be people
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.240]   that others are gonna respect and admire,
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.720]   then we gotta make those intentional decisions.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.640]   Look for the third way in anything.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:41.480]   Look for the way that you can do well financially
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.200]   and also simultaneously.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:48.880]   You can do well financially and simultaneously spend time.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.840]   And that's where I'm convinced.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.920]   Obviously I'm biased,
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:55.840]   but I'm convinced the value of the lifestyle
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.120]   that I'm modeling.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:01.060]   I was yesterday working on some of my training.
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:05.960]   I have a bunch of goals and I'm taking some business courses.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:09.720]   I'm taking some music courses this year,
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.640]   taking some language courses,
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.040]   and really just working hard to develop my skills.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.640]   And I was just thinking about how,
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.160]   because one of the things that I do
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.120]   is I share everything with my children.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.760]   My eldest child is finally at a point
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.840]   where he's right on the cusp of being able to go with me
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:29.160]   and not severely hinder me on a business trip.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:31.720]   I don't ever plan to travel alone on business again
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.060]   in my life.
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.880]   I don't ever plan to go to a seminar,
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.760]   to a course, or to a conference
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.840]   and not take at least one of my children,
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.280]   if not multiple of my children.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.640]   And so when I think about,
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.120]   I was considering the quality of the education
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.400]   that I'm taking.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.400]   These teachers that I've got are the best in the world.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.040]   I chose them because of the best in the world.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.680]   And with the miracle of modern communications technology,
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.660]   where the best teacher in the world
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.480]   can teach to a vast audience,
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.960]   it allows you to be an elite level learner
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.840]   from the comfort of your own home.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.200]   When you bring this in with your children,
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.560]   what it means is that because I include my children
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.760]   in my education to the extent that they're interested,
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.480]   it means that my children have an elite level education
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.280]   and it doesn't cost anything more.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:18.040]   And when I think about the,
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.780]   saying, okay, I'm gonna go stick them in,
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.960]   insert random local institution here
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:27.040]   where they just have whoever happens to be hired by that
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.900]   versus the elite level education,
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:32.480]   it's non-replaceable.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:35.840]   And then the actual experience of building something
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.000]   like a family business.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.200]   My favorite structure for people who are inclined
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.960]   is have a family business
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.760]   where mom and dad both work in the business,
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.360]   work full-time in the business,
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:49.100]   and the children are involved in that.
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.400]   Because now you have the opportunity
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.800]   for that very important education
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:57.120]   and it can be done very, very profitably.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:01.680]   So now we're not choosing between money or relationships,
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.120]   it's both and, it's money and relationships.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.840]   And I believe that those activities
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:11.000]   are actually important for children to be involved in.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.040]   I think one of the reasons
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.960]   why people don't spend more time with children
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:16.880]   is that they don't know what to do
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.720]   'cause we're so used to entertaining children,
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.240]   what, are we gonna sit around and stare at each other?
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.520]   And to me, that's the wrong thing,
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:28.440]   is that one of the reasons why we need important work,
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:31.800]   why we need work is so that our children
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.480]   can be involved in that work.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.440]   And that's what one of the things that I didn't like
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.680]   about my previous career was in an office environment.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.640]   And yeah, could I have brought my children in
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.800]   to some extent, but not in any meaningful way.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.020]   But if you have some kind of family business
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.340]   or if you have jobs that fit into that,
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:48.520]   involve your children in that.
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:49.840]   I don't want my children to sit around
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.440]   and be entertained all the time, I want them to work.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:55.640]   Because it's in that process of doing that work
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.680]   that they learn a lot of those lessons.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.840]   It's in the process of working with mom and dad
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.360]   that they see how mom and dad react,
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.280]   the kind of language that mom and dad use, et cetera,
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.320]   all those things that I previously talked about.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.020]   So I don't believe that you have to choose.
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:12.080]   The only thing that, just that if you did have to choose,
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.600]   you prioritize the children and the people.
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:19.040]   And what I see is that with a little bit of thoughtful
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:24.040]   and creative effort, many families who desire something
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:28.920]   where their children can be involved can build that.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.240]   And so consider it when you choose a career,
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.040]   consider it when you choose things.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.220]   And then if you're already kind of stuck in something
[00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:40.380]   or committed to something, that's okay.
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:43.380]   Just within that context, do the best you can
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:48.380]   to generate, to do the best you can in those circumstances.
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:51.300]   I would never choose to be a truck driver.
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:53.940]   I see that as a bad, unless I had to,
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.100]   because we were starving on the street.
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.540]   I don't see that as a lifestyle that's conducive
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:52:59.620]   to a healthy family life.
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:03.160]   Me, you know, sleeping at a truck stop six nights a week
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.420]   or 13 nights out of every two weeks.
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:07.620]   If I were a truck driver, I'd have one of my kids with me
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:08.460]   as soon as I could.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.500]   We'd do a lot of stuff in the car.
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.180]   And I'd take advantage of the modern technology
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:15.440]   to be as connected as I could, et cetera.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.700]   So all of us face different circumstances,
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:21.700]   but many times we're in circumstances
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:25.660]   due to a series of decisions that we made inadvisably.
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:27.000]   I'm stuck in a career.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.140]   It's a career that's gonna have bad results
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:31.940]   for something that matters to me.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.900]   Well, change, get a new career, redesign your business,
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:37.260]   redesign your job, redesign your life.
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.460]   Anybody can do it.
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:43.140]   But in the context, just make the best decisions
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:45.280]   that you can and may God give you wisdom.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:48.180]   Recognize that at the end of your life,
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.700]   the work that you do with your children,
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.060]   how you care for your children,
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.380]   how you raise your children,
[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:56.660]   the opportunities that you expose your children,
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:58.980]   the relationship that you have with your parents,
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.840]   how you care for your parents, how you support them,
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.740]   the kind of rich texture that you build
[00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:07.700]   to those relationships, the kind of sibling that you are,
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:10.240]   the relationships with your siblings,
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.460]   the kind of neighbor that you are,
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.180]   the kind of friend that you are,
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:16.100]   the kind of employer or employee that you are.
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.680]   Those are the things that when you're on your deathbed
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.620]   and you're reflecting back,
[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:23.700]   you wanna be satisfied with the decisions that you made.
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:27.100]   And so the money can come, the money can go,
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:31.740]   but don't harm those things that deeply matter.
