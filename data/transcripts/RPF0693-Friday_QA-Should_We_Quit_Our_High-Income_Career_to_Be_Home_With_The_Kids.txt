[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:18.960]   instead of, you know, rich respect, we could have toleration. Instead of, you know, very well behaved children, we could have children that are sort of behaved, not entirely insubordinate. Instead of being able

You're 50 years old, your children are adults, you're 70 years old. And so you achieved results of a six or a seven instead of a ten. Is that worth 1.5 million dollars? And you don't have to answer because of course that's a very personal question.

[00:34:47.440 --> 00:35:15.840]  's how I look at it. Is that if I know something is ideal, then let me find a way to get something that's ideal. And for me the reason why children and doing the best that I can as a parent is important is because there's probably not going to be that many people in my life who are going to truly love and support me and care for me throughout my entire lifetime.

Not all to the same degree, but they have that relationship with more or less. So, you know, one of my sisters is dead, but if you have six children that all care for you, that are your best friends... My parents have, I don't know, 16, 17 grandchildren? I can't remember. Anyway, they have a lot of grandchildren at this point in time.
