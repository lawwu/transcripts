[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is In Depth, a semi-regular series where I interview interesting people
[00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.520]   about their quest to cultivate a deep love.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.040]   Today's episode is presented by Defender, a vehicle designed for those seeking adventure
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.320]   in a distracted world.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.600]   Now, I've been looking forward to this episode for a while, as it's a chance to talk to a
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   writer who I've long followed and long have wanted to meet.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.440]   His name is Michael Easter.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.960]   He's a health and science journalist.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.880]   He used to be the fitness director at Men's Health Magazine.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.080]   He also used to be a journalism professor at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas,
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.720]   but he is most known now for his two best-selling books, The Comfort Crisis and Scarcity Brain,
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.360]   both of which I've read and highly recommend.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.520]   He's now a full-time writer who runs the very popular 2% Substack newsletter and podcast
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.440]   I subscribe to it and I recommend it.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.800]   If you're wondering, 2% refers to the fact that only 2% of people take the stairs instead
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.440]   of the escalator when both options are offered, even though research shows that taking the
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.200]   stairs would significantly improve your longevity.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.200]   This concept encapsulates a lot of Easter's writing, where he looks at the sort of common
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.120]   sense but no-nonsense evidence-based advice for how human beings can get the most out
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:37.480]   of their body, live healthy, live fit, get the most longevity out of their time here
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.480]   on earth.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.400]   Now, in this interview, I have two purposes.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.080]   One, I just want to learn his advice, the type of stuff he writes about his newsletter
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.280]   and his books.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.160]   Stick around for the end of the interview where I actually just ask him point-blank.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.040]   I said, "Okay, imagine you're one of my listeners and you haven't been thinking about your health
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.640]   and fitness and you want to start making changes.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.960]   What's the first thing you do?
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   What's the entry ramp?"
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.000]   Actually, it's sort of a surprising answer that overlaps with things we've been talking
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   about on my show.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   So stay tuned for that.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.560]   But here's my secret secondary goal for this interview, was to hear Michael's story.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.640]   Michael was a busy journalist and then he switched from writing for Men's Health magazine.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.840]   He had a relatively busy writing life because he was writing freelance, working on books
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.760]   and teaching a pretty full, I think it was a two-two or perhaps even a three-three course
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.440]   load at UNLV on journalism, and he dropped all of that.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.560]   He now pays his expenses with his newsletter and can just write full-time.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.040]   He lives in sort of, I don't know if you'd call it the countryside, but the desert makes
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040]   more sense.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.920]   He lives outside of Las Vegas and he goes on these epic rucks and runs with his dog
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.880]   through these scenic canyons.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.960]   His time is his own.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.240]   He can write what he wants to write in his books because his newsletter covers things.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.320]   I mean, he's cultivated a deep life and I'm interested in his story and I take him through
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.320]   a story how he got from working for Men's Health out of college to where he is today,
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.040]   including by the way, a very meaningful first stop with substance abuse.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.200]   It was in him kicking substance abuse, in him learning about himself on how to do that,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.520]   that this more crystallized version of the deep life that he lives now was formed.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.640]   I think his tale is fascinating.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.640]   You're going to hear his story and you're going to hear his advice.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.080]   Now, here's a side note, a little insider knowledge.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.680]   When I interviewed Michael, the interview you're about to hear, this was two days before
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.520]   me having to go in for a surgery, actually the first surgery that I had ever gotten.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.360]   Spoiler alert, I survived because I'm recording this intro after the surgery has already happened,
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.600]   but I was in a mindset when I was talking to Michael where I was thinking about and
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.080]   taking seriously my health and fitness in a way that I probably hadn't been before.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.600]   You might pick this up in the tone or the approach to my questions, but I was eager
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.960]   to learn.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.080]   I have come on the other side of that surgery with a lot of big plans in motion to reprioritize
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.800]   the type of things that Isser talks about.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.040]   As I'm now in middle age, this stuff matters.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.320]   It's going to give me a massive return potentially for the decades that follow.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.760]   I'm coming into this interview in a vulnerable state and in a well-timed state to receive
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.520]   this type of wisdom.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.080]   This interview extra matter to me.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.880]   Anyways, I think you'll like it.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.240]   Before we get to it, I want to say a word about today's presenting sponsor, which is
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.240]   Defender.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.960]   Our presenting sponsor is what allows us to present the interview that follows with zero
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.800]   commercial interruption.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.320]   The iconic Defender line of vehicles has been reimagined for a new generation of explorers.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.360]   The Defender 90, 110, and 130, which can seat up to eight passengers, all maintained a legendary
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.880]   off-road capability for which Defender is known, but now combine that with legendary
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.680]   new on-road capabilities and comfort as well.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.920]   Talk a little bit about the construction of these cars.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.720]   Aesthetically, if you've seen these things, they feature really compelling proportions
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.720]   and precise detailing.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.080]   I mean, I just love the look of this line of vehicles I always have.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.120]   If you learn from the engineers about what's going on sort of underneath these nice aesthetics,
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.000]   you figure out that they're built with a tough, rigid body design that helps add to their
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   famous durability.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.040]   It's a very sturdily made car, but also it's beautiful to look at.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.520]   So in other words, we think of it as a good looking car that performs perfect for finding
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.280]   adventure as you cultivate your own vision of the deep life.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.920]   So visit LandRoverUSA.com to learn more about the Defender.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.200]   And now, here's my conversation with Michael Easter.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   All right.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.960]   So I am thrilled to be here with Michael Easter.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.160]   Michael, one of the ways I explain, by the way, starting to do these semi-regular interview
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.400]   episodes, the people who ask like, "Why are you adding something else?"
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.240]   Eighty percent of the reason is an excuse to talk to people that I want to talk to anyways,
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.320]   and you are an embodiment of that.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.640]   This is my evil plan coming to fruition.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.440]   I've read your books and wanted to talk with you, and I had an excuse to get you on the
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.440]   microphone.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.000]   Well, I will say that works both ways, right?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.240]   Like when you emailed me, I was like, "Oh, my God, this is awesome.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.720]   I've always wanted to talk to this guy."
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.040]   So here we are.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.720]   The world works in mysterious ways and works in good ways a lot of times.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.680]   Everyone else can just sit back and enjoy you and I enjoying this.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.840]   So I'll start by explaining the goal of the conversation for you and for the audience.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.240]   So I think a lot and talk a lot about mismatches between the modern digital environment and
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.640]   the way our Paleolithic bodies and Neolithic culture operate.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:58.040]   I think in these mismatches are a lot of disorders of the modern world that we need to address.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.720]   One of the most consequential such mismatches, in my opinion, is what has happened when we've
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:08.800]   made our lives, professionally, personally, like all aspects of our lives, more abstract
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.440]   and more taking place on screens.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.680]   So this disembodiment of our life, it's where we're disembodied from our bodies in any particular
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.800]   location.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.600]   More and more what we do is just mediated back and forth through a screen.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.720]   There's a lot of economic advantages to that, to other players, but it has been difficult
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.400]   for us, the actual people.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:33.560]   Now, I see you, Michael, as being at the forefront of thinking about what goes wrong when we
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:40.760]   switch to this Cartesian brain in a vat model and how we can reclaim some of what our Paleolithic
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.360]   bodies are actually expecting, how to sort of fight back against this abstraction.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.120]   So that's really what I want to get into with you today.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.980]   But I want to get there via your story, which I think is fascinating.
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.840]   I think it highlights a lot of the issues you talk about and will sort of bring us to
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.320]   the sort of more concrete principles we want to discuss.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.320]   So if you're willing, I want to go all the way back.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.560]   You got started off, magazine journalist, Men's Health Magazine.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.200]   For a lot of people, this itself would be the end goal.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:16.040]   Man, if I could just live in the city and write for a well-known magazine, do cool articles,
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   everything would be cool.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.840]   So I want to start with just how did you even get that job?
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.080]   Coming out of college, what did you have to do to even get that job?
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.440]   Oh, man, yeah.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.600]   So I grew up in Utah, and I was raised by a single mom.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.320]   I'm the only child.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.600]   And my mom, I mean, she's like kind of a giant.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.520]   So the odds are really stacked against single moms.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.800]   Like you look at the stats, and I think more than half live in extreme poverty.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.520]   But my mom, I mean, she's just like driven, super driven, super smart.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.800]   She usually reads like at least 50 books a year.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.160]   And so we always had books lying around at home.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.520]   And I remember when I was, I think I was 13, I read this book, "Into Thin Air" by John
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.520]   Krakauer.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:06.580]   And it was just like, whoa, this dude went and climbed Everest and wrote an account of
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.580]   it.
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.000]   But the way it was written was really fascinating because he was kind of weaving in and out
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.360]   of topics.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.800]   I read a lot of Hunter Thompson when I was in high school.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.440]   And that was like another, oh, my God, I didn't know someone could do this with language.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.000]   Now when I went to college, I'd always been this book and magazine junkie.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.600]   But just in my mind, I'm like, no one is actually a writer.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.700]   Like no one actually does that job.
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.600]   And if they do, they probably live in their mother's basement.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:39.400]   And so I, my plan was to do like a business law degree, maybe work in natural resources
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.540]   because I've always been kind of outdoorsy.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:48.240]   But I ended up taking this, it was a nature writing class.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.440]   And it was just like, oh, my God, this is what I want to do with my life.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.600]   So I ended up going to grad school because I also happened to graduate the year that
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.680]   the economy totally tanked.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.980]   And so for my class, my graduating class, it was like, you're either going back to your
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:07.240]   parents' house and you're going to work some random job you don't want to work as you look
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.080]   for your real job, or you can go to grad school.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.680]   So I went to grad school and I ended up going in New York City just because that's where
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.160]   all the magazines are based.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:23.920]   And the program that I was in grad school in, it was a science, health and environmental
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.640]   reporting program.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.500]   So really, really focused on writing about different topics in science.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:36.740]   And even in that class, though, I was kind of, I was a little bit different in that like,
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.060]   you know, most people took their internship at Scientific American, but I took mine at
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:46.100]   Esquire just because the writing in that mag, that was like during the, to kind of get a
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.140]   little bit down the rabbit hole, that was during the David Granger years, he was the
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:56.340]   editor in chief, and the writing in that magazine was just so good, like so good, these features
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.580]   that just blow your mind.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:03.820]   So I interned there for a while, then when I graduated, I took these kind of two part
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.860]   time jobs at Scientific American and GQ.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.160]   So when you looked at my resume, I had on one hand, I had these dude magazines.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.900]   And on the other hand, I have this science magazine and a job opened up at Men's Health
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.140]   and they were like, well, we pretty much write about science for dudes.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.180]   So you seem like a good fit.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.180]   And yeah, I took that.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.460]   I took that job.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:32.060]   And what was nice about that job to kind of getting back to this theme of mismatches is
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:38.300]   that I had, I'd been living in New York City, which that was fun for about a month until
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.620]   you realize the place just drives you crazy and humans aren't necessarily designed for
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:49.820]   24/7 noise, light, never ending energy.
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:54.260]   And Men's Health was actually their headquarters was in this little town in Pennsylvania that
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.060]   was like an hour and a half away from New York City.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.340]   So I was able to live there.
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.540]   And I would occasionally go into the city, we had an office there, but it was like once
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.940]   every two weeks.
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.380]   So that was also another big upside of that job.
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:11.020]   And yeah, I worked that job for about seven years.
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.580]   And yeah, that's pretty good.
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.580]   I learned a lot there.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.580]   I mean, that was the big thing.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.260]   I learned a lot there.
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.580]   Where was the town in Pennsylvania?
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:24.020]   So the town that we were in is called Emmaus and the closest town that people would know
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.020]   is Allentown.
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.020]   Okay.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.100]   I didn't realize it was based out there.
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.420]   So what were you living in like a house at that point?
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.140]   I mean, there's not a lot of apartments out there.
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.820]   I was living at, so it's a lot of it's a lot of kind of like row houses.
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:43.220]   So when I moved out, I remember I had moved from a apartment in Hoboken, which was like
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.220]   one bedroom.
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.860]   It was like two grand a month.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.840]   And I moved out to that area.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.740]   And I had this place that had like two bedrooms.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.760]   It had a backyard and it was $800 a month.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.700]   And it was just like, Oh my God, why?
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.700]   Why haven't?
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.340]   Why did I live in New York at all?
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.340]   Yeah.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.340]   What was I trying to do?
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.340]   Yes.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.340]   Okay.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.340]   So now you're at Mentos.
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.340]   What's that job like?
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.460]   I mean, when you're, I don't know what the word would be, but when you're new, you just,
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.620]   I don't know if it's junior reporter or whatever it was, but, but what is the day-to-day of
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.940]   magazine journalism in the first decade of the two thousands?
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:17.940]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.060]   So when I started the internet hadn't really taken off.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:27.300]   Our website at the time was, we would take what was in the magazine and we would put
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.060]   it on the internet.
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:33.500]   And that was that like the website was this afterthought and it was all these kind of
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:40.740]   old school magazine types who really just kind of saw the website as this kind of little
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.740]   annoyance.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.540]   And it was often just kind of farmed out into, to another team that was sort of like looked
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.500]   down upon by the old school magazine editors.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:54.180]   But I was mostly, I was mostly on the magazine side that eventually transitioned and the
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:59.580]   job was really developing ideas and then just reporting them out.
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:05.080]   And also of course, because it's a magazine, like your presentation is so much different
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.500]   than it would be online or in a newspaper.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.260]   So it's nice cause I could get creative, come up with weird ideas.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:18.480]   And I will say, I mean the first three years, probably four years of my career was me basically
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.920]   just realizing that I sucked.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:26.220]   Like I went into that job, I had my fancy graduate school degree and I thought, oh,
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.580]   this is going to be great.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:33.340]   And I remember I had to do this section that was called bulletins back in the magazine
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:38.080]   where you would summarize studies and you would, it'd be about a hundred words to summarize
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080]   a study.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.980]   You'd have five studies on a page.
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:46.360]   So I sent my editor like 500 words of, you know, these five different summarizations
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.020]   of studies.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.380]   And this dude sent me back probably a thousand words in edits.
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:57.780]   It was just like, I got that, opened the document and was just like, oh my God.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.780]   And he was right.
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.300]   Of course he was right.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:06.100]   And yeah, it was just, I mean that first four years was just really figuring out like how,
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.100]   how do you write?
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:13.180]   How do you write in a way where you're presenting information that is pretty complex in a way
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:19.060]   that the average person can immediately understand, but also use, right?
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.260]   Because men's health is a service magazine, meaning that when you read something in that
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.460]   magazine, there's a implicit takeaway about how do I use this in my life?
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.460]   Yeah.
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:32.060]   Now, did you have an implicit idea going into that, that pretty soon you would be like 1990s
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.580]   Susan Casey, uh, outside magazine going on like long adventures that you would report
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.580]   back on.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.220]   Like, what was your, what were you thinking?
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.500]   Like I've heard, for example, at Columbia journalism school from my friends who, who
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.980]   went there years back, everyone's goal is to write long form for the New Yorker.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.620]   Like, this is what I'm going to do out of it.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.740]   And you know, only three people end up doing that.
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.460]   So what was the dreams versus reality when you started doing magazine journalism?
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.820]   Um, I thought that it was going to be that.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:04.900]   I thought that I was going to be, um, eventually going out to report crazy stories.
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:11.100]   And I will say this though, I, I was persistent and I was always pitching ideas that would
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.300]   get me out of the office.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.820]   And um, luckily they said yes to quite a few of them.
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.340]   It's like once I pulled off one that was, um, that worked pretty well, I had, I did
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:29.460]   this, I pitched this story where I was going to go, uh, basically join a power lifting
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.660]   federation.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:36.500]   But part of it was that I was lifting, I was training with this guy who, um, was the first
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.340]   guy to ever bench press a thousand pounds.
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:44.180]   And uh, his gym was this, it was in the middle of the woods, it was this rundown old garage
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.180]   they converted.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.420]   And this guy was the most giant human being you've ever seen.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.400]   He had a Mohawk that was pink.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.480]   There was about five pit bulls that were running around the gym.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.740]   Every single dude in there was like a bouncer in a motorcycle gang.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:04.400]   And I roll in, you know, six foot one, 170 pounds with my notebook, like, Hey guys.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.220]   And um, the story just worked cause it was just so funny that I was in there.
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:13.680]   And so after I did that, um, I would say the editors became a little more amenable to sending
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.420]   me out to report pieces.
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.580]   And I really, I mean, that's really what I lived for.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:21.200]   Like the day to day in the office, it was, you know, it was what it was, but if I could
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.740]   go out and meet people, get out into the world and just meet these weird subcultures, that
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.260]   was like, that was my jam.
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.860]   So what was your interest, you know, coming out of college, coming out of grad school,
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.020]   for example, were you outdoorsy at this point or not?
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.700]   Were you in the fitness at this point or not?
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.700]   Where was, where was your, like, why did you want to get out of the office?
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.420]   What was it that attracted you?
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.180]   What type of activities attracted you?
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.780]   Um, I would say big picture.
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:52.100]   What attracted me is, um, I've always just been interested in, in people and subcultures
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.100]   and ideas.
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.900]   Uh, my own personal interests is that I've always been pretty outdoorsy.
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:02.820]   Um, you know, grew up, grew up in Utah, so you kind of have to ski or snowboard and spend
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.840]   a lot of time mountain biking.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.780]   And um, fitness wise, I'd always, I'd been mildly interested.
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.020]   Like I always worked out, but it was kind of like, it was what it was.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.900]   Um, but I did actually become a lot more interested in health and fitness by taking that role
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.860]   just because you start to impel a lot of layers and you go, Oh, this is actually, this is
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.860]   pretty interesting.
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:27.820]   So then in the comfort crisis, you talk about how this dream job began to unravel or how
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.820]   you began the struggle.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.380]   So what, what happened there?
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:40.740]   Well, I think that, um, I think that I'm a person, like I said, I like to get out.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.560]   I like, I am happiest when I'm outdoors, arguably maybe doing something a little extreme when
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.740]   I'm in a, when I'm in a weird place where there's kind of a level, there's a lot of
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.500]   stimulation going on, right?
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.620]   Like I'm just one of these people who I just kind of need stimulation.
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:00.640]   And um, there could be long stretches of that magazine where I would just go into the office
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.820]   at nine.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:09.200]   You stay till six and eventually you're kind of doing the same thing over and over.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:15.300]   And eventually when I send in those studies, those like study blurbs, I get no edits back
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.940]   because now I've perfected that.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.580]   Like now I get it.
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.100]   And so it starts to kind of become, all right, I'm, I'm standing behind this.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:29.340]   Of course we all had standing desks and that's how I'm standing behind this screen for from
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:34.220]   nine to six every single day, I can pretty much predict exactly what is going to happen.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:39.840]   I'm indoors, my, my office for most of the time didn't have a window, took a while for
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.840]   me to get a window.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.520]   That was a big day.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:51.120]   And um, it just kind of, it just starts to kind of be at odds with what I think fundamentally
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.060]   get made me excited to get up and go to work every single day.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.400]   You know, even though I would occasionally get those reporting stories to your point
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:05.760]   about asking about what was, what was magazines like when you first started the funds for
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.560]   those kinds of stories started to kind of go away as the internet rose and there started
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:17.680]   to be more of the magazine became this sort of second thing to the internet and on the
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:24.440]   internet, especially as I was probably the last year of my time at men's health, we figured
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:30.940]   out, oh, if you run these crazy headlines, you can get clicks and the place started running
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.520]   stories that literally had nothing to do with health and it was all just about getting people
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.520]   to click.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.680]   And I'm just like, what the hell are we doing here?
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.680]   What do you do?
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.680]   Just a quick aside question.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.360]   What do you do for six or nine hours at a day?
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.940]   What are you doing as a journalist?
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.380]   That seems like a lot of time.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.640]   Are you writing that whole time?
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.680]   Like what happens in a nine hour day?
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.120]   I mean the capsules take you an hour to write.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.520]   Maybe you're in the, you're writing up a story and it as someone who writes and does a lot
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.800]   of other things and has to fit it in, I'm, I'm fascinated just as an aside, what was
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.920]   happening on your computer screen for nine hours in that windowless office?
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:11.840]   Oh dude, I mean you know this more than anyone that a person can't really crank out great
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:18.080]   writing for more than like four hours would be my absolute max and that's if we're on
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.440]   a run for a few days maybe.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.520]   And then beyond that, it's like maybe you're getting in two hours of solid writing a day.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:32.400]   I mean, and the thing is, is that it was kind of this old school, almost like madmen mentality
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.280]   coming out of the, coming out of the magazine industry where it's like you show up at nine
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.880]   and you leave at six.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.880]   Doesn't matter.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.840]   And so how do you fill that time?
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.280]   We would have these meetings where we would go sit on these couches in the main room and
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.600]   we would come up with headlines for stories, right?
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:56.080]   So we'd put all the, all the stories, like print them out, put them on the wall and we
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.880]   would come up with headlines for individual stories.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.220]   And I'm not kidding you.
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.640]   We could take one hour going back and forth about a headline that was going to be on a
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.860]   one page story and you're going, like people just thrown out ideas.
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:14.080]   And really it was just, it really, it was just dude sitting around BSing because we
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.680]   needed to fill the time pretending like it was productive.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.520]   And it was just, you know, sometimes you'd have good conversations, it could be fun,
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.080]   but sometimes you're just going, what the hell are we doing here?
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.080]   Oh man.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:32.000]   So then how did you talk frankly in, in, uh, in your comfort crisis about, um, the alcohol
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   dependency?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.240]   Does that arise in this time and is this in response to this, uh, what's your disillusionment
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.120]   from work or is it help create your issues at work?
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.920]   I mean, how did, how did that begin to raise its head?
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.200]   I don't think, I don't think the boredom of the job helped.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.520]   I'll say that.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.240]   Um, I think there's some, I think that's one of those topics that's like really complicated
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.640]   and you kind of start to unpeel the layers of why over time.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:07.760]   Um, but, uh, I think the fundamental reason that my drinking definitely kicked up while
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.760]   I was there.
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:16.080]   Um, no, I will say that even the first time I drank, I was like, oh wow, this makes life
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.080]   more interesting.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.760]   And if one is good, what would two be like?
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.340]   And if two is like that, what's three like?
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:29.600]   So I always like to say that my, my favorite drink was always the next one.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.000]   And when you drink like that, you can accumulate some problems.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.760]   And a good sign that you have a drinking problem is that all of your problems are caused by
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.500]   your drinking.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.880]   And that was totally me.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.800]   And I think that it, uh, when I kind of peel back and it's taking me a while to figure
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:50.480]   this out, when I peel back, I think that, um, because my life, especially at that time
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:57.880]   was really kind of predictable routine and wrote, um, and I'm a person who kind of needs
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.760]   stimulation likes to explore the edges.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:06.760]   It's like if I could go back on a weekend to my apartment in Allentown or whatever,
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:12.480]   if I were to drink, I can guarantee that that night was going to be more interesting and
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.640]   more unpredictable than if I were to not drink.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.640]   All right.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.760]   If I didn't drink, I'd be like, all right, I'm probably going to watch Netflix.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.760]   Maybe I'll go get dinner.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.760]   I'll go to bed by 10.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.200]   If I have one drink, I just go roll in the dice.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.280]   Who the hell knows what's going to happen here.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.560]   And so I think that was that like searching for stimulation and just something else to
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:38.400]   do that was more exciting was really, um, kind of push that and drove that.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.840]   And like I said, it's like, you know, some people they do that and they're, they're good
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.840]   with three.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.880]   I was never that type of person.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:50.280]   And, um, that eventually just led to, um, yeah, a lot of problems in my life and I kind
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.760]   of had to, I kind of had to figure that out.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.760]   So, okay.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.320]   So you have all this going on, uh, and this brings us to the point that my listeners are
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.200]   often really interested in, which is the, both the practical and psychological reality
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:09.000]   of when people began doing, um, intentional lifestyle crafting, right?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.720]   And so we're getting to the point now where some relatively large changes happen in your
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.720]   life.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.720]   And so I'm interested in kind of dive it into the psychology at this moment.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:27.400]   What were the thoughts that began to crystallize that would eventually push you to do something
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.400]   different?
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.000]   How can we understand, uh, you beginning to think, okay, I want to change things about
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   my life.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.400]   What was the thought process that was happening as you were there in Allentown and going to
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.840]   the windowless room and drinking too much?
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:44.400]   And, um, what's inside the mind of Michael Easter that began to push you towards let's
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.400]   change some things.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:51.120]   I mean, I wish I could, I wish I could say that I had this planned out at the time.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:59.680]   Um, I didn't, but I think really when you look at, uh, addiction, it's basically choosing
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.240]   a short term benefit at the expense of longterm growth.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.320]   That's really how I see it.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:10.240]   And so for me, it's like I needed, I needed something to just like feel something and
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.040]   alcohol gave me that.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:18.160]   Now eventually the downsides of alcohol, they begin to really outweigh any of the benefits
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.400]   I'm getting.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.800]   And yet I don't really know how to get out of that.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   Right.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:28.040]   Because the thing is, is if I drink, like immediately I can fix whatever this underlying
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.040]   problem is.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.700]   It's like really short term, easy way to fix a problem.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.700]   Eventually that stops working.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:38.480]   And eventually I think the, the, the downsides just start to really pile up.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:45.920]   And I'd tried to quit drinking, I mean, a hundred times, you know, and eventually just
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.200]   for whatever reason, one morning I woke up and it was kind of like this shift where I
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:55.680]   realized that if I was to continue this behavior, I was probably, um, not to get too dramatic
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.640]   here, but this is what I thought that I was probably going to die early.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.080]   Like I could just kind of see it.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:09.560]   And I kind of realized that in all the times I had tried to quit drinking before, I'd always
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.240]   kind of looked for like the easy way out, you know, it's like, oh, well maybe I could
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.840]   do this and then I can just drink less.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.760]   And I came up with all these schemes and I just kind of accepted like, Hey, this is going
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:19.760]   to be really hard.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.520]   Like, this is definitely going to be hard.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:26.720]   And another thing I did is that, um, my mom has actually been sober for about four years.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.600]   She got sober right before she had me.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.900]   And I'd never really talked to her about my drinking.
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:35.360]   And I called her and I told her, I'm like, Hey mom, she had no idea I even drank much
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.000]   less had a problem with it.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.480]   And I told her, Hey, I got a drinking problem.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.700]   And so I think that sort of that admission and that reaching out and asking for help,
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:49.400]   I think that shifted something in my mind where I just kind of went, okay, I can't figure
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.400]   this out on my own.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.560]   I'm probably going to have to talk to people who've been there and who can help me.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:00.520]   And so I talked to her, I found a handful of people that had been in a similar situation
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.520]   as me.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.400]   And one guy in particular was just extremely helpful.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:11.160]   And so I do think it was just the problems piled up so much that something had to give.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:18.000]   And when it gave that sort of pushed me to do something other than drinking.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.840]   And then you find the problem, okay, now we got to solve for what alcohol was solving
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.400]   for and we have to overhaul our life.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:32.920]   And so I just had to add in new things that would sort of give me that stimulation.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.880]   And once the alcohol was gone, though, it's like, okay, the job is only doing so much
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.880]   for me.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.880]   And that's when I started looking for sort of other ways out.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.880]   That's fascinating.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:47.000]   Well, I'm part of what's fascinating is we see that same effect with smartphone addiction,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   much more attenuated.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.240]   But I mean, this comes out of my work is that people who succeed in drastically changing
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:58.320]   their relationship to their phones do so because they aggressively invest in alternatives.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.120]   And the people who white knuckle like, all right, well, here's what I'm going to do.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.280]   I'm just going to use it less and I'm not going to have my bedroom, they start putting
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.760]   rules around it, but don't have any replacement for what the phone was doing for them.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.840]   They all go back.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.900]   So there's an interesting parallel.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:18.440]   So did you try and try to replace this with other more other stimulating activities while
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.000]   you still had your job at men's health?
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.160]   What type of things were you trying at first before you made the decision I need to actually
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.160]   change my job itself?
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.160]   Right?
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.360]   This was outdoors activity, like getting back in the mountain biking.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:33.640]   Like, what did you what were you what were your first steps towards adding like recasting
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.640]   your lifestyle?
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:40.500]   Yeah, if I can, if I can think about a few of them, I started hanging out with other
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.980]   people that would kind of, you know, like I was the type of person that like, I would
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:50.300]   just kind of hang out either with my girlfriend or alone.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:54.060]   And then on the weekends, I might have some friends come in for from college and you know,
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:59.140]   our sort of thing we do together is just go out and get crazy.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:04.420]   And so I had to start hanging out with other people who the relationships didn't evolve
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.660]   around revolve around drinking.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:10.020]   And I will say that my girlfriend at the time, she is now my wife.
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:14.920]   She's never been a big drinker and she was exceedingly supportive and awesome.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:20.500]   And so hanging out with a new group that had kind of been there was really useful.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.700]   I also I got a dog.
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.940]   And and part of the reason that we're now a lot of people would say like, and this was
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:32.100]   like a month after I've been sober, a lot of people would be like, you got a dog after
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.980]   a month of being sober, you're insane.
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:39.220]   But here's the thing that dog saved my life, because all of a sudden, I had to care about
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.600]   something else other than myself.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.060]   And I and I'd spend like all my drinking years pretty much giving a shit about one person.
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.060]   And that was me.
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:51.360]   And now all of a sudden, I have to, I have to care for this dog.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:57.180]   And so what that did, and and I also got a German short hair pointer, which is a hunting
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:00.700]   dog that needs a whole hell of a lot of exercise.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.460]   So I would have to get up early, I would have to take that dog.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:10.380]   And morning before work, I would take the dog to this park that was out in nature.
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.740]   It was right by a river.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:16.500]   And we would just walk the park for about an hour as the sun was coming up.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:21.200]   And that was like this new way of seeing like, oh, there's like something here that had kind
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:27.180]   of been removed from my life and in drinking, but is kind of giving me this deeper thing
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:31.540]   I need that's making me happy, really.
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.340]   And so that was super useful.
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:40.540]   And then I started exercising more, I start like on the weekends, I would, I would get
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:44.820]   up early and I'd go do I'd go for a hike, I'd go for a long bike ride, I'd go, I'd go
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:45.820]   do something.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:49.820]   And that gave me a reason to go to bed on time and to like not drink.
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:54.540]   And if I ever really wanted to drink, which I was lucky that I will say a lot of people
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.440]   have fits and starts.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.900]   When I was done, I was done.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.060]   It was like, we're like, we're going for this.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:07.260]   You know what I mean? like I didn't have like urges to go out and drink.
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:14.580]   And I will also say that over time, the times that I have thought I've missed alcohol, when
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:19.060]   I unpack that, it's really that I missed the context of the drinking.
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.560]   And that's that you're with friends, you're able to let loose.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.340]   And I was like, Oh, well, do you really need to have two drinks to let loose?
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:31.780]   No, you can just like, you can just like let loose without having alcohol around.
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:32.780]   You know?
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:36.060]   And so I think it's just like kind of this long process of self discovery where you have
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.460]   to, but if nothing changes, nothing changes.
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.940]   You got to start making these big, deeper changes.
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:49.700]   And I think you see that, like you said, as a theme from getting out of any behavior that
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:54.300]   you are overdoing, that is hurting your life.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.380]   Like you got to, you got to change something.
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:01.340]   So then how did your, what caused the evolution of your relationship with men's health?
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.460]   It's not that you stopped writing for them.
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:06.380]   I mean, even your Guy Fieri article is not even that old.
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.540]   And I've looked through your bibliography.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.940]   There's periods where you'll write six or seven articles freelance for them.
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:15.660]   So when it comes to that particular professional transition, you've now been exposed to other
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.660]   things just to use like the terminology my audience knows.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.460]   You've been exposed to these other lifestyle factors that are resonating.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:26.780]   It's the time outside, the caring for someone else, the exercise, the deeper connections
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:27.780]   with community.
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:32.460]   And so suddenly you're gaining this insight into what resonates and what doesn't.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:37.740]   What was the sequence of changes you made to your actual professional situation and
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.540]   how did that unfold?
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.580]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:48.800]   So I was probably at the magazine for about maybe two years when I was sober.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:55.060]   And so I think after, you know, I sort of go through the most acute period of, you know,
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:59.300]   white knuckling as they call it, of sobriety.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:03.500]   Then once I was through with that, you realize, okay, well, I'm still in this office.
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.780]   It's still boring.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.900]   Nothing has changed in the magazine industry here.
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:12.300]   And so I just, I knew I loved the writing aspect.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:17.020]   Didn't love the standing at a desk in an office behind a screen all day.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.820]   Did like getting out in the world and reporting.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:23.220]   And so, and having interesting experiences, meeting interesting people.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.340]   And so for a while I thought, well, maybe I just need to find a new career.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:30.620]   I kind of looked around at some different things, apply for some jobs, kind of got deep
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.120]   into them, but they didn't work out.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.420]   And eventually it just, it occurred to me.
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:42.580]   We started talking to my now wife and we decided, all right, let's try and move somewhere.
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:46.100]   Maybe I could, maybe I could freelance cause then I would only be writing, but it would
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.300]   be more on my terms.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:54.140]   And then it popped in my head, oh, well I know I can only write well for about four
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:56.500]   hours a day max.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:04.380]   So what could I do to earn income and have a safety net in those other hours of the day?
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:09.820]   And I'd always thought it would be awesome to work at a university in a, you know, in
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.700]   a teaching role.
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:16.180]   And it occurred to me like, well, if you, if you teach journalism, like your research
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.820]   is continuing to do the work.
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:23.340]   If you're in the professional position, like a lot of journalism departments have and my
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:27.460]   wife and I, and this is crazy how this worked out.
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:31.540]   My wife and I had identified either Phoenix or Las Vegas as somewhere we wanted to move.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.540]   Why?
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.300]   And that's, I don't mean that, I don't mean that in like a dismissive way, but in like
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:40.980]   a curious way because you're both East coasters and that's like a very specific decision.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.980]   Totally.
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.300]   So I'll tell you why.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.580]   It's because we wanted to move West and she said, no snow.
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.280]   And I said, no California.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.540]   And so that kind of left us with, all right, we got like maybe certain parts of Texas,
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.500]   but definitely Arizona, definitely Las Vegas.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:00.180]   And we, we had come out to Las Vegas for some reason or another and we're like, oh wow,
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.180]   this is actually a really great town.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.460]   The strip is what it is.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.460]   Some people love it.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.460]   Some people hate it.
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:09.660]   I personally love it for the people watching and the fact that it's just like this big
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.100]   human behavior laboratory.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:20.060]   And so I ended up sending an email to a guy who ran the magazine program at UNLV and I
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:26.980]   was just like, hey, thinking about moving out, wondering if you have any adjunct courses,
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.820]   here's my background, blah, blah, blah.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:36.140]   And it just so happened that they were looking for a professional, a full-time professional
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:41.500]   instructor to teach health journalism because they just opened a medical school.
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.820]   Like they hadn't even advertised the role.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:48.980]   And he forwarded my email on to the head of the department and literally a week later
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:54.580]   I went in, I interviewed and a week after that, this was, this would have been December.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:58.740]   They said, okay, we'd like to hire you, but can you start in January?
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:03.660]   And so we were like, all right, fire sale, just like pack up the house.
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.020]   We're driving across the country to move to Las Vegas.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.380]   And that was that.
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.260]   And what were you looking for?
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:15.500]   Like what were the properties the job had that made you say, yeah, let's roll with this?
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:21.340]   I think that it was the ability to continue to write for magazines to do just the writing
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.380]   thing.
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:29.540]   And also I think the uncertainty and the learning that would come with the teaching aspect of
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.540]   that job.
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.540]   Yeah.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:36.140]   So I was teaching three classes when I started and then the other half of my job was continuing
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.700]   the writing.
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:41.520]   So the university could have people who were actually doing the thing in the department
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.780]   because there weren't many in the department when I started.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:44.860]   I think I was the only one.
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.860]   So that's a reduced, they gave you, that's a reduced load because they wanted you to
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:48.860]   write.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.860]   Correct.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:50.860]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.860]   So it would have otherwise been like a four, four or something like that, or it would have
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.420]   been, would have been a four, four.
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.420]   Yeah.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.420]   Yep.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:00.380]   They had me do three classes and then the professional work filled in that fourth spot.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:05.100]   And you had, um, a nice thing about these jobs is it's the opposite of the standing
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:10.220]   desk, nine to six, whenever or wherever, however you get it done is up to you about these jobs.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.340]   You need to be in the classroom when your class is being taught.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:16.940]   You need to be in your office for the office hours, but otherwise, however you want to
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.340]   do it, that's kind of a nice thing about these positions.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.740]   So that must've been a nice change of pace from what you were doing.
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.740]   Oh yeah.
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.980]   Cause I was coming from, I was coming from the magazine world where you have all these
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:31.360]   60 year old guys who were going, no, you come in at nine and you leave at six.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.740]   That's just what you do.
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.020]   And so it gave me a lot more freedom.
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.900]   And I think that, um, that was good for me.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.140]   I could, you know, go explore Las Vegas.
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:46.020]   I could, uh, I could work reporting trips around my teaching schedule and I also, yeah.
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.260]   What was the typical day like, like what, how did you work out your schedule?
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.260]   Over time.
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.580]   I mean, when I first started, they were kind of just like, here's your schedule.
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:58.740]   And I was in four days a week prepping a lot, probably and all that prepping a ton when
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:02.940]   I heard, I mean, when I first started, I didn't do as much writing as I wanted cause that
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:07.180]   first semester was really, we got to figure out how the hell do you do this?
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:12.300]   I mean, it was hilarious too, because I'd never, I'd never taught.
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:16.180]   And um, I said, okay, like what do I do?
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.660]   And they go, okay, well your class.
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.180]   And they gave me the names of the three classes.
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.780]   And I said, okay, great.
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:25.140]   So like, is there an instruction handbook on how to do that?
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.700]   And they go, no, those are the names of the three classes.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.700]   Figure it out.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.700]   I was like, okay.
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.180]   Um, so that was a lot of time figuring it out.
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:36.620]   But once I, but once I had figured it out, um, obviously a lot of that, that time frees
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:42.060]   up and, um, I could then start to focus, start to focus more on the writing.
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:46.740]   But I did, um, I did love the teaching element, just interacting with young people.
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:54.060]   And I like that it forced me to have to think about why I did the things I did in my, in
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:58.460]   my writing work and reporting work, you know, so some, you know, some of that, well, why
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.460]   do you do that?
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:02.980]   And you're like, Oh, that's a good question.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.980]   Why do I do that?
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.220]   And then you have to unpack your thinking and you find some flaws in it.
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.980]   You, it strengthens ideas.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.740]   Maybe you start to see how could I do this better?
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.940]   And so, yeah, that was, it was a lot of fun.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.020]   And what year was this when you started in Las Vegas?
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.580]   This would have been 2017.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.380]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.380]   Okay.
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:27.480]   And then in, okay, so between your two books, there's like several really large scale reporting
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.780]   trips mentioned, right?
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:36.580]   You have investigating the, the rising drug trade in sort of post-war Iraq.
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:38.660]   You have your time in Bhutan.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:42.180]   Where did those larger reporting trips that you then use in your books, where do those
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.340]   fall in this timeline?
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.900]   Was that while you were still in Allentown or these, these, you found a way to do these
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.980]   longer form pieces once you're in Las Vegas?
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.100]   Those are all when I was in Las Vegas.
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:58.940]   Now I will say, um, the Arctic trip, I, um, I was blessed to have a good head of the department
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:03.820]   and he was like, okay, so you have to be in the Arctic from basic all of September.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.180]   And we should explain this.
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:09.580]   This is the, the structuring story of the, if I'm thinking of the right story of the
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:16.700]   comfort crisis where you go on an elk hunting trip in Arctic Alaska that was, um, not comfortable
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.140]   in a very, very specific way.
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.140]   Okay.
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.860]   Um, and was that, but that trip, was that even for reporting or at the time or was that
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:25.860]   just, you wanted to do it?
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.620]   Yeah, that was for reporting.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:33.300]   So I, um, I had done, uh, what happened with, uh, with that is I had, I had done a magazine
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:39.060]   article for men's health that, um, was a profile of the guy, Donnie Vincent, who I was in the
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.060]   Arctic with.
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:44.220]   He's this sort of, um, for listeners, he's this back country bow hunter and filmmaker
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:50.180]   who's really, I think changing the face of hunting, how it's perceived, how it's practiced
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:53.340]   and just, uh, just a really deep thinker in the space.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:57.220]   And so I had profiled him and, and done this short hunt with him.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:02.980]   And I realized that piece could probably be blown out into a bar.
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:07.260]   I mean, there was just so much that I wanted to write in that, in that story.
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:11.780]   And of course it, you know, it could only run at three, 4,000 words or something.
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:18.100]   And so, um, from that piece, I ended up, um, pitching the book to publishers.
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:24.420]   And as part of that, it was, okay, the overarching narrative is going to be this, um, 30 plus
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:30.820]   day journey I take into the Arctic on a hunting trip with him to sort of get into these fundamental
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:36.580]   discomforts that humans face every day in the past that we no longer face anymore that
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:38.660]   can be healthy for us.
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:42.900]   And so I pitched that and when, once the publisher bought it, um, you know, I had to go to my
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:46.180]   head of the department and be like, Hey, I got to be gone in September.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.980]   Can, can someone just fill this like one class I have?
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:54.140]   And I was able to like get the others online just for the month.
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:58.100]   So I had two that I was able to put online for that month and then come back in person.
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:03.860]   And then I had one that was, um, just a lecture every week that my department had, he had
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:08.060]   taught the class before and so he was like, all right, I'll get it for you.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.980]   And um, he was just, he's just a saint to do that.
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:15.460]   But then, then the other trips, I would just plan those during times I wasn't teaching.
[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:19.860]   So I mean, it's interesting to me that the type of reporting you wanted to do all along,
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:25.140]   you really started doing after you weren't a full time employee of a magazine.
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:29.460]   Is that, so how did that, I guess there was still maybe like the pay wasn't great for
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:36.580]   the pieces, but people were still willing to take long form reporting like this.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.860]   But it, if you were on salary, they're like, no, no, no, you have to, we need seven articles
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.020]   a week from you for the web.
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.380]   Like what, how did that happen that you began doing the reporting that you really wanted
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.740]   to do after you left, um, being a full time journalist?
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:49.740]   Yeah.
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:54.260]   Well, I mean the answer is that if you're on salary as a editor writer, they want you
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.060]   in the office a certain amount of time and you can only leave the office so much because
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:00.940]   you've got a million different tasks.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:06.980]   Um, the budgets are kind of constrained and frankly they would rather just give it out
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:13.620]   to a freelancer, um, who has ample time to spend to doing these crazy reporting trips.
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:18.900]   So I almost kind of took on, left the magazine and took on the role of what would be a freelancer
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:25.300]   and what was able to fund those, those trips was, um, the book advances basically.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:29.260]   Right, because economically you can't really make a living doing those long form freelance
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.260]   pieces.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:33.780]   It just, it doesn't work out because you can only do what, two a year if they're really
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:39.100]   reported and you know, here's your like $6,000 or whatever for six months worth of effort
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.940]   that the economics don't work out.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:41.940]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:42.940]   Okay.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:43.940]   That's fast.
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:44.940]   Okay.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:45.940]   So then we get to your books.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:46.940]   I love how this is unfolding.
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.100]   Um, so we get to your book, the comfort crisis, your first book, and then the scarcity brain
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.100]   came second.
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:55.700]   Um, so you, you pitch it, you've done a profile already of the main person, but you had not
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:56.940]   yet done the trip.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:00.780]   So if I understand this right, when you did the actual hunting trip, this was after you
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.340]   already sold the book.
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.220]   Um, and you had pitched like, here's, I'm going to go back out, I'm going to go to the
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:09.300]   Arctic with this character I wrote about over here.
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.420]   Were you imagining, and I love that we're going to get into this now we can dive into
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.420]   the book.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.420]   So it's perfect.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:17.940]   Um, were you imagining, I think most writers, myself included, my first instinct would be
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:20.900]   thinking of like coming to America, this is going to be John McPhee.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.740]   It's going to be really just character driven.
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:31.180]   Whereas the book ended up being like one of the big idea books, you know, of, of the,
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:33.660]   of the last, however many years, I mean, it's a fantastic book.
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:38.260]   I mean, it really became much more of like a Gladwellian idea book with that as the spine
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:43.500]   where you went off and met lots of other people that talk about or the help uncover these
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.060]   other types of principles.
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:51.100]   So, you know, how did that evolve from this is going to be me and this character and what
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.660]   I'm learning from this exposure to like, that's going to be the spine of an idea book.
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:58.020]   It's going to actually have a lot of ideas, a lot of science back stuff, a lot of actually
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:02.260]   like talking to other people and, uh, how did that unfold?
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:09.220]   Yeah, I think that it was really just noticing that the books that I liked to read usually
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:14.540]   had a narrative, um, a kind of, uh, a big overarching narrative, but, um, also realizing
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:20.700]   that I've also always been fascinated with research that can, um, hopefully improve the
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:29.500]   reader's life and, um, realizing that I, and I think, I think most people, the story gets
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.460]   them into the big idea.
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:35.180]   So when I teach this, it's like, if I'm trying to write a book, like I have this, I'm sure
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.180]   you're the same way.
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.180]   I have this big idea.
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.180]   I need to communicate.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.180]   Right.
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.020]   So the big idea is often abstract.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.500]   It's somewhat complex.
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:47.580]   And if I just go right into the big idea, I've lost you because you haven't bought in.
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:54.580]   So the story, it almost acts as the vehicle, um, sort of the express way into that bigger
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.580]   idea.
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:47:00.740]   Cause if I can get someone in with a story, um, they buy in, they buy into a character.
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:04.660]   They want to know, you know, the character is in this, um, precarious position.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:08.740]   It's like just basic storytelling and they got to figure things out and they're learning
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:09.740]   things along the way.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:14.340]   And as the character is learning things along the way, that is to say me and these books,
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:19.900]   um, I can peel off into these bigger ideas where the person will have, have bought in
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:26.060]   and hopefully have more interest in the big idea because they bought into this interesting
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:27.060]   story.
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.060]   That's sort of getting there.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.060]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:33.780]   So then one of the energies I see in the book and my audience knows, because I've raved
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:38.140]   about both your books, but about comfort crisis in particular, I really thought it was one
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:40.780]   of the better idea books the last half decade.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:45.060]   And there's a symmetry I saw between it and my book deep work, which was, you know, when
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:50.380]   I was writing deep work, I was also very personally invested in this idea because I was a young
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:55.100]   professor and I was trying to figure out cognitive life and, and the incursions into it.
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.420]   And I think that that there's an energy that comes into it.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.940]   And then the comfort crisis has that as well.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:05.660]   You can kind of sense there is a personal, this big personal investment you have in these
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:06.660]   ideas.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:10.020]   And you invest in them, like which, which sells them as potentially transformative.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.820]   So you're at this stage of your life when you're writing this book where you've just
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.380]   started making like a lot of changes.
[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:18.100]   You've grabbed the reins of autonomy.
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:21.860]   What happened in your own personal life in terms of like your habits or how you lived
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:22.860]   or et cetera?
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:29.180]   What changes began to come out of working on the book about discomfort?
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:32.660]   Like what was that feedback loop between the book and then how you were actually living
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:33.660]   your life?
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:34.660]   Yeah.
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:38.260]   Well, I think you're right and I have deep work right here.
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:42.020]   I think you're right that like a lot of times writers are just kind of figuring out their
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:45.060]   own shit on the page, you know?
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:51.220]   And so that was definitely the comfort crisis, like coming out of getting sober, figuring
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.700]   that out.
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:59.340]   And I think it was the, this recognition that all the work I did for men's health, we were
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:05.540]   talking about these sort of lifestyle changes that would lead to improvements.
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:09.420]   Every single lifestyle change that we talked about, it was usually uncomfortable, right?
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.940]   If it's, if it's exercise to improve your fitness, exercise is uncomfortable.
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.220]   If it's losing weight, you're probably going to have to eat less.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.220]   You're going to be hungry.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.220]   That's uncomfortable.
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:20.420]   Mental health, getting over your mental health stuff is usually uncomfortable.
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:28.000]   So seeing that, that sort of path that doing things that are uncomfortable leads is sort
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.940]   of a necessary buy into improvement to these greater goods.
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:36.660]   And having that exact same story in my sobriety, I mean, that's absolutely the most uncomfortable
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:37.660]   thing I've ever done.
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:44.380]   But once I went through that, my life improved so much, like unbelievable changes, like everything
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:45.920]   got better.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:55.020]   And so sort of seeing that and then through my time outdoors, realizing that the outdoors
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:59.860]   are uncomfortable, too hot, too cold.
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.940]   Everything takes effort.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:05.460]   You have long stretches of boredom, like just on and on and on.
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:08.260]   And then you go back from the outdoors into everyday life.
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:13.940]   And it's like, oh my God, like everything is so comfortable in our world.
[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:18.460]   And just realizing that that shift where, where I kind of go, well, humans live for
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:25.740]   all of time, walking around outdoors, looking for food, basically trying to keep their kids
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:26.980]   alive.
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:29.620]   Nothing was ever comfortable.
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:33.260]   And then we as a species suddenly get place.
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:39.540]   We engineer our environments to be comfortable in so many different ways across the board.
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:43.980]   And then the big idea question is, okay, well, how has that changed us and, and what can
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:44.980]   we do about it?
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:48.900]   - Yeah, well, and I think the digital, when it enters this conversation, brought us cognitive
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:49.900]   comfort.
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:53.820]   So there's a lot of things in the last 200 years, maybe even just 150 years that gave
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:54.980]   us physical comfort.
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:58.700]   It's the cars and HVAC and comfortable mattresses.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:02.700]   But then what's the, what's the story of the last 10 years is this cognitive comfort of
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:08.140]   no boredom, take out all of the friction of sociality and all the sort of like uncertainty
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:12.460]   and just, it's, it's on here and I can just tap this thing.
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:15.660]   Get rid of the difficulty of putting yourself out there for leadership and community.
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:19.500]   Like I can be a leader by posting things on Twitter that gets like comments.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:26.020]   You can kind of play with these, these like these human drives and it, it takes away all
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.500]   cognitive discomfort.
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:31.060]   And that was one of the big threats to your book is, you know, it's not just physical,
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:35.480]   but also cognitive discomfort that, that there, that there's something to it.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.480]   How do you think about this theory?
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:40.500]   Here's a theory I've been pitching, which I don't have science for it, but it sounds
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.500]   reasonable, right?
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:45.380]   So one of the things I've been pitching on my show recently is this idea that we have
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:46.940]   fundamental human drives.
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:54.300]   You know, there's like for, for community and leadership and food, obviously.
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:55.300]   Boredom is a big drive.
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:56.300]   It feels really bad.
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.300]   Right?
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.340]   So alleviation of boredom.
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:02.300]   And at the, the goal of these drives is to push us to do hard things that will be rewarding
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:06.460]   in the future because they, we have a very strong pull and fundamental human drives.
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:07.460]   They're hard to ignore.
[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.500]   So eventually they make us get up and do stuff.
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:14.780]   And that is like a, a big difference from some other animals because like, we're not
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:16.260]   just energy conserving.
[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.740]   We are, we get up and do things.
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:20.900]   And that one of the issues with technology is it subverts the drives.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.620]   It kind of simulates the reward.
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:27.580]   Like these drives need just enough that like you lose that motivation to get up.
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:33.540]   Like the video game makes you feel just competent enough that, that like you don't get up in
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:37.100]   a way that if you didn't have the video game, like eventually that like drive towards competency
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:41.060]   is like, I got to get up and go learn how to hunt or whatever.
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.060]   Right.
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:43.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:45.500]   And so I have this theory that like when the technology, we have drives that push us to
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.860]   do the type of things that you talked about in your book and technology can subvert them
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:53.420]   just enough to prevent action, but we get none of the rewards that the, that the action
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.420]   gives us.
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:55.900]   It's just kind of track.
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:53:00.780]   Oh yeah, I, I agree a hundred percent.
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:03.020]   And I'll give you a good example.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:11.220]   It's, um, so when I was in the Arctic for a month, um, we're up there hunting, um, hunting
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:14.580]   is for those who've never hunted, it's actually not action packed at all.
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:16.660]   It's like a lot of waiting.
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.580]   And so we'd sit on these Hills waiting for caribou to come through.
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:22.660]   Cause we're kind of timing our hunt to this migration.
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:26.700]   No caribou are coming through for like a couple of weeks.
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:28.700]   And I didn't have my cell phone.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.300]   I had my cell phone, but it didn't, it was useless.
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:32.300]   Right.
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:37.180]   I didn't have televisions and computers and iPads and all this stuff.
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:43.460]   And so when you're sitting out there, all of a sudden I find myself like really bored.
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:49.180]   And so when boredom kicks on, I kind of think about it as this uncomfortable cue that tells
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.780]   people go do something else.
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.180]   So it's neither good nor bad.
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:57.220]   It's just this drive that says, Hey, the return on your time invested with what you're doing
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:00.100]   right now, it is worn thin, go do something else.
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:05.580]   So when you think about it in the context of evolution, if it's a million years ago
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:10.200]   and you and I are sitting on this Hill hunting and we need food to survive, if no animals
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.820]   are coming through boredom kicks on and it says, go do something else.
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:17.240]   And in the past that something else was often productive to your point.
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.100]   So you and I would go, Hey, no animals.
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.260]   Why don't we go, why don't we go search for berries?
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.180]   Why don't we go to hunt another speed?
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:26.660]   Like there's all these things we would do that were often productive, pushing us towards
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:28.420]   survival.
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:33.020]   But now we have this easy, effortless escape from it that is just highly stimulating in
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.900]   the form of cell phones, right?
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.620]   It's like you feel that, and obviously everyone sees it.
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:38.620]   Everyone experiences it.
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:41.900]   The moment you feel that you immediately pull the phone out.
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.100]   Now in the Arctic, I didn't have that.
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:46.880]   So like I said, neither good nor bad.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:50.820]   Some of the stuff we would do to alleviate our boredom, which is totally stupid.
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.940]   Like we would read the labels on our food.
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:57.640]   We would just tell these ridiculous stories that went nowhere.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:03.360]   On the other hand, I also came up with more good ideas for my writing than I've ever come
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.300]   up with in my entire life.
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:08.420]   I wrote things that ended up in the book that are probably some of the best things I've
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:09.420]   ever written.
[00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:14.380]   I came up with like Christmas shopping lists for all my friends and family, like all these
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:19.060]   like weird, productive things that I just never would have gotten had I been bored at
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:23.660]   home because the default would have been, Oh, go to the screen and work.
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:27.020]   Oh, an alert just came in from your cell phone.
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:32.060]   And so I think that kind of to the bigger points that that's why kind of this removal,
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:37.960]   having these times where you remove yourself and yes, you will have to be uncomfortably
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:44.580]   bored for a little bit, but seeing where that takes you is going to be a lot more interesting
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:51.140]   and arguably productive than watching the next amazing dog video that comes upon your
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:52.900]   Instagram feed or whatever it might be.
[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:58.020]   So was your book, your first book, was it a success right away or was it a slow burn?
[00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:03.020]   What was the experience like when that came out?
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.820]   So we got lucky the first week, got on some big podcasts.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.020]   So we had a big, pretty big opening week.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:13.800]   But then it kind of just kind of slowed and it, you know, it was like a steady, steady,
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.820]   but over time it took about a year for it to really pick up in sales.
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:23.100]   So yeah, it took about one year and there was, you know, I think it was a word of mouth.
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:29.540]   It was people who had platforms, eventually it getting to them and them saying, just like
[00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:30.860]   you right now, right?
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:35.680]   The book Comfort Crisis came out more than three years ago and we're talking right now.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:36.680]   That sort of spread.
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:40.340]   I think the idea is just spreading people, I know people liked reading it.
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:42.900]   Not everyone liked reading it, but enough people liked reading it.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:46.380]   It's a good news and bad news about publishing, right?
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:50.820]   You can't, there's no formula to make your book sell a lot of copies.
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:54.900]   It just has to be, it's simple in the sense that it just has to be something that like
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:57.580]   people are really interested in and want to tell people about.
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:03.540]   The bad news is that's really hard to do, but that is the common experience of not everyone.
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:06.420]   Sometimes your book is the right book for the right time and everyone reads it immediately.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.300]   This is like John Haidt in the Anxious Generation.
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:12.180]   Like if you, if you've been working for a decade on a topic that everyone cares about
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:15.580]   and your book comes out right at the right time, then it could just like immediately
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:16.780]   be a big success.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.940]   But Deep Work had a similar experience.
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:22.340]   That's never, it was never on the New York Times bestseller list.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:28.140]   Never on a weekly national bestseller list and is like 2 million copies in, you know,
[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:29.140]   that's crazy.
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:30.340]   Just like, yeah, that's it.
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:31.340]   That's it.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:32.340]   Right.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:36.780]   It's like, it's you, it's you wrote a book that is really good, that helps people, that's
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:42.620]   actionable that they can apply and word just spreads, you know, that's fantastic.
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:43.620]   So then what was the plan?
[00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:45.900]   You had the first book come out.
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:47.020]   Did you have like a new plan?
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:49.460]   Like, okay, here is, here's my plan for my life.
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:53.980]   Like I'm going to write books on a certain frequency while my, my position at Las Vegas,
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:58.240]   like I'm sure it changed your thought of like, okay, here's my rhythm between freelancing
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.580]   books and professorship.
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:04.940]   How did you revise your kind of life plan if at all in this sort of post first book
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:07.820]   period?
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:10.820]   I wish I could tell you that I had a life plan going in.
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:16.020]   I mean, I wrote like, you know, my thought then was like, you write a book to write the
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:21.840]   book and then you realize that, oh, the book opens up all these other doors that I just
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.860]   had no idea were there.
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:27.300]   And so a lot of it was kind of figuring out, all right, now that this book seems to be
[00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:31.980]   resonating with people, it's like, what the hell do you, what do you do with that?
[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:33.180]   Right.
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:38.980]   And so it kind of, I think it took me a while to figure out what I wanted to do.
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:45.860]   And I, um, I actually, I signed the contract for scarcity brain right before the comfort
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:51.060]   crisis came out because I was like, all right, this will guarantee I have more work.
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:53.780]   Cause I don't, I have no idea if this book's going to sell or not.
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.920]   So let's strike while the iron's hot.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:02.980]   And so I immediately just started working on scarcity brain, um, eventually just through
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:05.620]   sending out some random newsletters here or there.
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:11.180]   My newsletter list had grown and, um, I started to get more regular with that.
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:16.700]   And then I eventually took that over to sub stack and I publish on that three times a
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:21.580]   week because that allows me to kind of write in real time.
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:22.580]   Right.
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:28.900]   I'm sure you've noticed that with a book, um, I love books because it kind of gets to
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:33.820]   the heart of things and you, you get real clear on ideas at the same time.
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:37.820]   It's, you know, on a two, three year cadence or whatever it might be.
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:42.420]   And so being able to talk about things in real life or in real time rather, I think
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.740]   it's been useful for sub stack.
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:46.140]   And then how did that start changing?
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:48.380]   Let me be more specific.
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:51.180]   When did you, first of all, when did you go over to sub stack?
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:57.300]   What was what when you, when you fix the regular cadence of three times a week, when was that?
[00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:01.220]   That would have been may of what you're 22, no 23.
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:02.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:07.820]   So I've been doing that for about a year and a half now coming up on two years.
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:10.900]   And that really was just that I had this newsletter that was going out once a week.
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.460]   I enjoyed writing it.
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:16.540]   And um, one of the guys that sub stack reached out and said, Hey, we think you could do a
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:18.420]   successful sub stack.
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.420]   You want to try it?
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:23.220]   And I was like, no one's going to sign up for this and like pay for this, you know,
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.220]   it's not going to happen.
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:28.220]   Um, but I was just like, all right, worst that happens is like, it's not a success.
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:31.620]   And then I just go back to once a week, you know, what the hell do I care?
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:33.540]   And so I tried it and I had this like goal.
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:38.900]   I was like, Hey, if I can, if I can have this many subscribers and this amount of time,
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:39.900]   that'll be a success.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.060]   And I kind of pushed that.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:45.380]   I said, all right, if I can do that in like three years, then this is worth it.
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.700]   And I think I hit that goal in like three months.
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:52.220]   So it was like, all right, looks like sub stack is the thing we'll be doing this.
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:53.220]   So, and it's, it's been fun.
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:54.220]   It's been awesome.
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:59.700]   I mean, I will say that it is, um, a lot of work, but it is also trained me to get better
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:02.860]   at distilling my thoughts and writing them quickly.
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:06.580]   Whereas I was like in book mind where I'm like, Oh, I got, I got, I got two years for
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.580]   this project, man.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:10.140]   We can just take this real nice and slow.
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:12.940]   And it has kind of trained me to get faster.
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:18.620]   So it took me about a year to not feel like I was constantly in sort of crazy sprint mode.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:20.260]   But once I got it, I got it.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.980]   And um, it's been a real fun project.
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:25.700]   So, and do I understand right that now you write full time?
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:26.700]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:27.700]   Okay.
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:31.660]   So was, was sub stack that success a big part of that decision?
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:37.260]   Just because that's more, it's more immediate, it's more regular, um, from just like a financial
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:41.620]   perspective, it feels somehow more predictable than books, which, you know, it could be years
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:42.620]   till it comes out.
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:43.620]   You don't know how it's going to go.
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:44.620]   What was sub stack?
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:47.540]   The thing that changed, like made that an option in your mind, or was it like the success of
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:48.540]   the books?
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:54.780]   Um, I would say it was a little bit of both, but I would say that sub stack made me feel
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:58.260]   like I had something that was more predictable and regular.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.260]   Right?
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:04.820]   I mean, with books, I'm like, okay, things are going great now, but next week, who knows?
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:08.620]   I'm sure you've, you've probably seen the numbers on your books where it's like one
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:10.620]   week for whatever reason, you sell a lot.
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:14.100]   And then the next you're like, well, why did we sell less than like, you just don't know.
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:18.220]   So sub stack was a little more, um, predictable.
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:23.100]   And um, the other thing that kind of made me switch to writing full time is that the
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:27.500]   university, um, kind of altered how they were going to approach things.
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.900]   And they wanted me to teach four classes.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:34.220]   And it was just like, I can't do sub stack and books and teach four classes, guys.
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:35.220]   Sorry.
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.220]   This just like, isn't going to work out.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:40.820]   And luckily the books and the sub stack had put me in a position where I was totally fine
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:41.820]   with that.
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:47.680]   And also God bless my wife who has a, um, works for a big insurance company and brings
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.380]   in the healthcare and all that sort of thing.
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:50.380]   So yeah.
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:51.980]   So, so that worked out.
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:52.980]   Okay.
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:56.060]   So now you're writing, so that is a geek question, writing geek question.
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:03:01.800]   So how do you structure your week in terms of when, when you work on the newsletter versus
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.480]   when you might be working on a book, um, or freelance, do you have a, a rhyme or reason
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.480]   to how you do it?
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.380]   I'm curious, like how much time these different things take up and what your workday now looks
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:11.380]   like.
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:20.440]   Um, so I'll first say that, uh, I, even if I was a plumber or a auto mechanic or a lawyer,
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.900]   I would still be writing.
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.420]   So writing, I'm, I love it.
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:24.420]   I'm passionate about it.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.420]   It's my hobby.
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:29.020]   Just so happens that I'm, I'm lucky that it's also the, the career.
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:36.820]   Um, so pretty much every day I get up pretty early, um, usually in between four and 5am
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.240]   and uh, I immediately just start writing.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:43.900]   Like I read, I once read this book called deep work and it told me that like finding
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:49.620]   your most productive time and really guarding that is a good plan, which I ironically stole
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:55.700]   from you this morning for this interview, which we're doing only I get to do the deep
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:56.700]   work.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:57.700]   Come on.
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.700]   Yes, you get it.
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:01.540]   You obviously get a pass cause you've greatly improved my productivity.
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:07.340]   Uh, so yeah, I, I usually will write until I don't know, maybe nine.
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:12.260]   So just having that time where it's like, we're really just focused on the writing has
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:18.260]   been really great and you differentiate between newsletter and book writing.
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:22.020]   Is it like that, that morning is when I'm writing books and then I have other time for
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:25.220]   newsletter or it's just like whatever is next on whatever you want to work on next, you're
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:26.220]   doing it.
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:27.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:28.220]   You put those, you mix those two together.
[01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.220]   Yep.
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.220]   I would say those two get mixed.
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:35.420]   And then, um, you know, after that I'll do the kind of other things that don't take as
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:36.420]   much thought.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:40.740]   And then a lot of times I can get some good time in, um, in the afternoon, like after
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.700]   breakfast, I usually eat at like 10 and then I can jam some more time in there depending
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.820]   on what's going on with meetings and things.
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:51.300]   That obviously kind of fluctuates based on what else is happening in my life.
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:55.300]   But yeah, I mean a lot of it is just writing every day.
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:56.820]   I try and get outside every day.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.820]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:04:58.820]   You do these long walks.
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:02.820]   So like when do you normally do those long walks, those desert walks you talk about?
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.820]   That will sometimes be before breakfast.
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.300]   Sometimes it's after breakfast.
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:11.700]   Um, Sunday is probably the one day where I eat into that writing time where when the
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:16.380]   sun's, when the sun's coming up, my dog and I will usually go do a long run.
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:21.820]   And, um, but by, by Sunday I've usually kind of figured out the coming week of sub stack
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:23.220]   and all that stuff.
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.900]   So what about exercise outside of walking?
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.500]   Would you do it at home?
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:28.500]   When'd you do it?
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:29.500]   How much time do you spend?
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.500]   At home?
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.300]   Uh, before dinner usually.
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:42.660]   So, um, just because at that time it's like I try to, I try to get my most productive
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:47.060]   time of thought and ideas and creativity.
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:50.900]   I try and do the writing then, you know, and, and I think kind of the takeaways you've talked
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:54.980]   about, it's like, what's your goal, what's your big goal.
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:58.220]   Um, what's the time that you were most productive to your big goal.
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.220]   All right.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.220]   Pair those two things.
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:01.220]   Yeah.
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:02.220]   Right.
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.740]   It's like at one point I had, I had tried exercising in the morning cause then it's
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:05.140]   like, all right, I'll, I'll be done with this.
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:09.620]   But it was cutting into my most important writing time and I wasn't as good of a writer
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:13.380]   between three and five and so it was like, all right, put exercise at the end of that.
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:20.180]   And I think that, um, I don't, you know, there's a lot of talk online about morning routines
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:26.780]   and um, my morning routine is immediately start writing cause anytime that I'm, you
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:33.940]   know, drinking magic mushroom coffee or meditating or writing at a gratitude journal, I'm not
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:37.060]   doing the writing that is like my main goal.
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:41.520]   So I try and just go right into it and then put the other stuff other times of the day
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.820]   if that's useful.
[01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:43.820]   Oh, fascinating.
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:46.660]   Uh, I love the schedule, jealous of the schedule.
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:50.900]   And are you, when it comes to the exercise in the afternoon, um, you know, I just met
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:55.020]   Peter Attia for the first time and I know you know, um, are you like in the Attia school
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:07:00.500]   of like the, it's, it's very locked in exactly what I'm doing because it's part of, you know,
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:04.740]   I'm building my mitochondrial through six hours of zone two on a 17 schedule.
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:10.140]   Are you more of a, let's, let's, you know, carry a heavy thing and like run up a mountain
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:18.520]   or where do you fall on that spectrum of just moving rocks and uh, you know, doing your
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.100]   carefully calibrated zone too?
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:23.820]   Yeah, I'm, I'm definitely not as calibrated as, um, as Peter.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.380]   I don't think many people are, he's, he's the man.
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:28.380]   I love that guy.
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.380]   He's so great.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:35.580]   Um, I, I try and strength train at least two or three times a week.
[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:41.100]   Most of what I'm doing goes back to, am I physically capable outdoors and in the mountains?
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:43.060]   Because I like to do a lot of backcountry hunting.
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.820]   I do like long stuff outdoors.
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:52.460]   I do think when you look at, um, humans, I think there's a really good case to be made
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.620]   for taking exercise outside.
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:59.180]   One, it gets you outside that has plenty of, you know, mental benefits.
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:03.680]   But also when you think about the context of the outdoors, there's a lot more unpredictability.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:08.020]   So I'll give you an example of running on a treadmill versus running on a trail.
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:11.780]   When you run on a treadmill, you can just totally zone out.
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:14.700]   You're watching Mari Povich or whatever the hell it is.
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.140]   Each step is the exact same.
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:22.820]   You can perfectly dial up your, uh, the, uh, up and down, the incline doesn't change the
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:23.820]   ground below you.
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:24.820]   It doesn't change.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:26.460]   You're just totally out there, right?
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:27.780]   Like you can just totally zone out.
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:31.780]   But if you're on a trail, all of a sudden that changes, that all of a sudden becomes
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:36.460]   very cognitively demanding too, because where you place your foot really matters.
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:39.140]   So you don't roll an ankle, your hills are going to be up and down.
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:40.660]   So you have to learn to pace yourself.
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:42.700]   You're getting all this outdoor exposure.
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:47.260]   You're seeing all these interesting things along the way that are taking your attention.
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:52.680]   And also I think kind of forcing a little more creativity, not to mention things are
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.580]   just unpredictable in other ways.
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:58.780]   Like the other day I was out running and there's this like pack of coyotes, just, you know,
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:00.580]   coming up the trail, ran right past me.
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:01.900]   It was like, Hey, what's up guys?
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:03.740]   And they're like, huh, what are you doing out here?
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:04.980]   And we went our separate ways.
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:07.740]   And that, that's something that I'm always going to remember.
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:13.380]   Whereas if I'm indoors, really kind of trying to dial in everything perfectly, I don't get
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:14.380]   that.
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:15.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:17.060]   There may be a coyote attack in the Mori Povich episodes.
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:18.060]   You never know.
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.060]   All right.
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.460]   So I know we're up against time.
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:24.060]   So I'm, my final question is going to be an advice oriented question.
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:28.340]   I'm working on this new book called the deep life and you don't know this yet, but I talked
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:33.960]   about you somewhat extensively in it because one of the big ideas of the book is we too
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:39.260]   often jump right into the big changes we want to make to make our life more intentional.
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:43.100]   And we skipped the first part where we prepare to succeed with those changes.
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:44.420]   There's the get your act together.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:45.420]   I talked about this a lot on my show.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:48.700]   You kind of have to get your act together first before you make major changes to your
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:52.220]   production or the changes are going to sort of fizzle out.
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:56.580]   And I talk about you and I talk about the comfort crisis in part because, um, one of
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:00.260]   the things a lot of people have to get used to first is there's going to be a lot of discomfort
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:03.560]   in all these changes that are going to follow.
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.300]   So why don't you get comfortable with this comfort early on?
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.180]   That's part of your preparation.
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:13.660]   So to that end, if you're talking to, I'll give you a sample audience member you're talking
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:17.760]   to, like you're, it's maybe it's someone in their twenties and you know, they have a job
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.760]   they're doing.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.760]   Okay.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.760]   They're not really that happy.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:21.760]   They're on their phone.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.760]   Right.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:26.120]   And maybe otherwise partying, playing a lot of video games or what have you.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:32.400]   And we're saying, okay, we want to give you the six month plan for, um, just turning up
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.940]   your comfort with this comfort off of zero.
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.560]   So we, we, we don't want to overwhelm you.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.600]   We don't want to send you in the Arctic, you know, to do the, the hunting of the caribou
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:41.600]   right away.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.600]   What are the, like the things you would suggest, whatever it is, the two or three things of
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:52.320]   someone who is overly comforted in that first six months that just break the seal on I can
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:53.400]   survive this comfort.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:58.680]   What type, what have you found from your readers and experience to be like good ways into that?
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:10:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.640]   So here's what I'd say is big picture.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.360]   Um, I call this the 2% mindset.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.360]   Okay.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:10.280]   So there's this study that really sort of changed how I think about humans and human
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:15.400]   behavior and it found that 2% of people take the stairs when there's also an escalator
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.200]   available.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:21.360]   Now 100% of those people knew that if they were to take the stairs, they would get a
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.680]   better longterm return on their health, probably on their mindset.
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.000]   They'd get all these different benefits, right?
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.120]   But 98% of people choose to do the thing that is easier in the short term that actually
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:36.880]   often causes them longterm harm, right?
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:43.160]   And so this tells me that humans are wired to do the next easiest, most comfortable thing,
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.120]   even when it doesn't serve us.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:49.240]   And so I think if you can, the sort of bigger metaphor here is that it's not just about
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.080]   the stairs and the escalator.
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:55.320]   It's about if you have an opportunity to do this slightly harder thing, it's like you
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.280]   have to get to the second floor.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.480]   You can take the stairs, you can take the escalator.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:02.560]   If you take the stairs, that's going to give you this longer return.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:06.960]   And so sort of taking that mindset and thinking, okay, where else can I apply that into my
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:07.960]   day?
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.760]   It's like, if I come up on a set of stairs and escalator, I'm taking the stairs.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:18.000]   If I need to talk to someone, I can either send this text where I have no real interaction
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.840]   with them, or I can call them.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:26.400]   Can you figure out if I have a work phone call, you can take it sitting at your desk
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:31.040]   doing nothing, or you can pop in your earbuds and like, "Hey, go for a walk."
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.440]   I have a whole 2% manifesto on the sub stack that really gets into a bunch of different
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.440]   ideas.
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.560]   But I do think it is thinking of ways to just make what you're already going to do a little
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.860]   bit more challenging, a little bit more uncomfortable in a way that's going to give you a long-term
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:45.860]   return.
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:50.560]   And once you start doing that, it's like, I like to explain that once you get out to
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:53.060]   edges, people don't fall off them.
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:54.280]   The edge expands.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.000]   So you're kind of slowly like really just stretching this comfort zone.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.240]   And then eventually you look back and you've made these big changes and now you can do
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:07.220]   all these other things that you weren't able to do in the past and what you used to think
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:08.220]   was uncomfortable.
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:13.460]   These are just everyday routine things and along the way to that, things have changed
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:14.700]   and you've become a better person.
[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:15.700]   - Oh, I love that.
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:19.040]   So it's not just, okay, I want to make a change tomorrow.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:23.320]   It's 90 minutes a day of endurance runs in the mountains.
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:27.340]   It's maybe starting with all of these mild ways throughout the days in which you can
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:31.280]   choose slight discomfort over comfort in a way that's going to have value.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.960]   That rewires your brain, that changes your thresholds.
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:38.000]   And then as you say, that edge expands, you might find yourself six months later.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.680]   Now doing something that if you had tried day two, would have fizzled out.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:49.360]   I think there is a great message for my audience, especially when it comes to the preparation
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.760]   point of the decline.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.160]   You'll even find, I would argue for my audience, the struggles you're having with the digital
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.680]   will get easier by adding discomfort to the analog and that we often separate these two.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:03.040]   The digital is its own problem and I need to stop using my phone so much.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.320]   Oh, unrelated.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.560]   I should take the stairs more, I should exercise more.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:10.960]   They're completely connected because it's uncomfortable not to use your phone in the
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.800]   way you're using before.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.800]   And if you're comfortable with discomfort, like, yeah, of course it is, so are a lot
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.800]   of things.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.560]   So is like the runs I do and this, I, you know, that's fine.
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.560]   You're much more likely to say, that's fine.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.100]   You know, it's not going to overwhelm me.
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:26.100]   So totally.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:30.720]   And, and I'll also say that sometimes when I'll talk about this, people, people will
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.800]   kind of go, yeah, right.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:33.800]   Just taking the stairs.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.200]   I can't, I can't do that much.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:39.400]   Well, one, it's a metaphor, two, I'll give you a good data point.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:43.100]   There's this study that found that people who took, I think it was just five flights
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:48.320]   of stairs a week, they had a 30% lower risk of all cause mortality.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.400]   Like we've engineered so much discomfort out of our life that just adding a little bit
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:58.760]   back in, especially if you were like the most comfortable, it has huge outsized returns.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.360]   And it's not interrupt to your point.
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.520]   It's not interrupting your life.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:05.640]   You're not going from, well, I used to do nothing and now I'm doing 90 minutes of zone
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:10.280]   two and this heart rate, but it's like, no, you're just doing something that you're already
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:11.280]   going to do.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:14.240]   You're just making the slightly more uncomfortable version that's going to give you these big
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.960]   benefits and not upending your life.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:16.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:17.960]   Well, I love this.
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:21.640]   Well, Michael, this has been fantastic, you know, for my listeners, the, the books are
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:24.800]   the comfort crisis and it's the scarcity mindset.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:25.800]   I have that, right.
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:27.920]   I actually read scarcity brain, scarcity brain.
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:28.920]   Yeah.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.480]   So I love scarcity brain and the comfort crisis.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:37.880]   The sub stack that Michael's been talking about is that 2% PCT, T W O P C T.com.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.220]   It's also in podcast form.
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:41.220]   So I subscribe, Michael.
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:43.120]   So I know about this.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.320]   You can get, you can read it, but also you get the subscriber access to the podcast.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:51.640]   Um, and if you want to decide whether to be a paid subscriber or not, is it one out of
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:52.640]   three?
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.560]   What, what is the non defree one out of three a week?
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.560]   Yep.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.000]   So Tuesday is always free.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.280]   And then Wednesday and Friday, I try and I try and give some useful information.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:08.440]   Um, so if you're a, if you're a free subscriber, you still get Wednesday and Friday, you'll
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:12.120]   get a little bit of, um, useful information, but paid subscribers kind of get the full
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:15.560]   boat on Wednesday and Friday that has like all the deeper stuff.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.600]   And I'll, I'll often find myself maybe seeing your email in my inbox, like, Oh, I'm interested
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.460]   in that article, but I'm in a hurry.
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:26.120]   And then later if I'm doing a workout, there's the podcast version and like, great, I'll
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.760]   just listen to it, which I think is a nice touch.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:28.760]   All right.
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.760]   Well, Michael, this has been fantastic.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:34.000]   I'm loved having a chance to talk to you and thanks for sharing, uh, thanks for sharing
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   your wisdom.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   Thanks so much for having me, man.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   This is great.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   All right.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   So there we go.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.460]   That was my conversation with Michael Easter presented by Defender.
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:47.720]   Visit LandRoverUSA.com to learn more about Defender.
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:48.720]   All right.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.720]   I really enjoyed that interview.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:54.440]   I love the mix of Michael's story plus his advice.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:59.080]   I think just hearing Michael's story actually helps us learn a lot of the way he thinks
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.900]   about the things he writes about.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:03.320]   We see where his advice comes from.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:08.040]   One thing I wanted to underscore here at the end of the interview was that advice he gave
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.040]   at the end.
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.040]   Right.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.160]   So let's say you're, you're suffering from the comfort crisis.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.160]   You're a knowledge worker.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.160]   You're on your screens all the time.
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:20.240]   You listen to a lot of Cal Newport caring about not using social media and having your
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:21.760]   emails organized.
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:28.400]   How do you, what's the first step I asked him to trying to move towards this embracing
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:33.120]   discomfort, living more the way that our Paleolithic bodies were evolved.
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.160]   What's the first step?
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.880]   Notice what he said.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.720]   Start very small.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:43.120]   You don't have to come out of the gate saying, all right guys, I'm rucking 10 miles a day
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.120]   in the woods.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:50.760]   I'm going to walk 50,000 steps a day and lift rocks and carry rocks underwater and rivers.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:55.560]   You know, you don't have to come out of the gates like an endurance athlete.
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:57.080]   It's a mindset shift.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:04.520]   He says do something every day, a little bit of discomfort and your mind begins to learn.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.720]   It's okay to not try to optimize comfort.
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:10.600]   It changes its story about yourself.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:16.840]   And on top of that new story, you can then weave over time a life that much more aggressively
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:20.160]   engages with the health and fitness tips that he gives later on.
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.960]   This is very similar to the discipline ladder concept we talk about on our podcast, where
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:28.360]   I say, look, discipline is not a personality trait you're born with or not.
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:31.400]   It's also not something you turn on or off binary.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.520]   It's a belief you have about yourself.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:37.040]   I am a disciplined person that you build through evidence and the discipline ladder says start
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:41.360]   with something simple that helps you begin to rewrite your stories.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:47.480]   Like I talk about daily metrics, have a few daily metrics that are tractable but non-trivial
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.480]   for the things that matter.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:52.640]   Take you a couple of minutes every day, but you do those for a month or so.
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.480]   Your mind says, I'm someone who's willing to take extra effort on the things I care
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.480]   about.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:01.640]   I'm willing to put in extra effort on the things I care about, even if I don't have
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:02.640]   to.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:03.640]   And even if it's a little hard.
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:07.200]   And then once your mind believes you're that type of person, you can ladder up to slightly
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:10.880]   harder things and from there to something slightly harder.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.800]   That's exactly what I think Michael is talking about with health and fitness here.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:18.960]   You start with a little discomfort, you teach yourself discomfort is okay, and then you
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:21.040]   start laddering.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:27.200]   And so it's the walk before the sun, the 10 minute walk before the sun comes up becomes
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:34.080]   later the longer rock, which later becomes the burn the ships workout that Michael talks
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:36.560]   about on his newsletter every Friday.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:40.000]   Every Friday as they called burn the ships, just like crazy workout all of his readers
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000]   do.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000]   So I love that.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.040]   Michael and I are in sync.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:48.080]   And of course, I love to hear stories of people who have a very similar life to mine.
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:51.760]   They're academics, they're writers, they're busy who simplify things and spend time walking
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:52.960]   the desert with a dog.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.920]   Michael, you are convincing me.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:58.240]   Don't be surprised if you find me six months from now as your new neighbor saying, all
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.240]   right, when are we rocking?
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:02.280]   I just started a sub stack and that's what I'm doing now.
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.280]   Very appealing.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.280]   It was cool interview.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.280]   Read the comfort crisis.
