[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   Why must our bodies get resurrected?
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.940]   That was one theme Pastor John touched on in a message in the spring of 2014 delivered
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.520]   at the Carl F.H. Henry Center for Theological Understanding at Trinity International University
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.640]   near Chicago.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.740]   In that message, Pastor John was recounting some lessons he's taken from the works of
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.880]   Jonathan Edwards, lessons he's learned about the work of Christ.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.020]   Here's a clip I wanted to share from that message.
[00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:40.000]   The work of Christ in redemption does not only restore, it advances God's aim in creation.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.920]   Christ was not merely a remedy or an afterthought to recover what was lost.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.140]   The history of redemption climaxes with the cross, not only as a means of restoration,
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.120]   but a means of advance.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.800]   Christ was the goal of creation, not a means to the goal.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.380]   Didn't just recover a goal.
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.700]   He was the goal.
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:18.020]   And by his incarnation and death and resurrection, the glory of God was put on new display in
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.120]   its most vivid and lavish excellency.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.400]   Christ did not come and die and rise only to restore our joy in God, but to become our
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.780]   joy in God.
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.400]   The incarnate God did not appear simply to enable us to rejoice in God, to become the
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.760]   focus of our rejoicing in God.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:53.940]   Edwards put his incomparable lens to the gospel of the glory of Christ to describe the glory
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.840]   of Christ most compellingly in maybe the third most famous sermon, namely the excellency
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.220]   of Christ, which I love.
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.700]   And the beauty of Christ in that sermon is developed in a stunning way to show that when
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.560]   Christ did his work, he wasn't in his work merely enabling us to have something we had
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.120]   lost, but to become in that work the very focus of the glory that we once thought we
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.120]   saw and now see in fullness.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.660]   So here's his description of the glory of Christ that we could not know, the glory of
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.880]   God that we could not know without the revelation of God in Christ.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.760]   The beauty is in the juxtaposition of these seeming opposites.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.160]   If you've read this sermon, you know what this is going to sound like.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.600]   Infinite highness and infinite condescension, infinite justice and infinite grace.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.880]   These are things that mingle in Christ and thus constitute his incomparable beauty.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.800]   Infinite glory and lowest humility, infinite majesty and transcendent meekness, deepest
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.600]   reverence towards God and equality with God, infinite worthiness of good and the greatest
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.000]   patience under sufferings of evil, an exceeding spirit of obedience with supreme dominion
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.280]   over heaven and earth, absolute sovereignty and perfect resignation, self-sufficiency,
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.480]   and an entire trust and reliance on God.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:45.000]   Christ, the incarnate second person of the Trinity, the Redeemer, is now the fullness
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.240]   of the revelation of the glory of God.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:55.320]   He didn't just repair our ability to see something old, he became what God meant for us to see
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.320]   all along.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.360]   So for example, when it says in Psalm 1611, "You make known to me the path of life.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.080]   In your presence there is fullness of joy.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.120]   At your right hand are pleasures forevermore."
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.240]   The Old Testament saints tasted that and it was glorious.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.520]   And they didn't have a clue what the fullness meant.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.880]   None of the saints knew the fullness of the meaning of that promise, that at God's right
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.600]   hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.640]   It took the incarnation and the New Testament revelation to show that the pleasures at God's
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.920]   right hand are the pleasures of God the Father in God the Son, and the pleasures of God the
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.480]   Son in God the Father.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:50.080]   And now he has come, "This is my loved Son in whom I delight.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.600]   I am well pleased."
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:59.040]   And you should put into the term "well pleased" billions of tons of pleasure.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.160]   We gloss over those words so quickly.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:13.400]   This is my beloved Son in whom I, God Almighty, with all my infinite energy am totally pleased
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.960]   and have been from all eternity.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.640]   And now you can see what my joy is.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.480]   Now you can see the joy that is at my right hand.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.920]   My joy is joy in my image, in my Son.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:35.480]   What binds the children of God to their Father for eternity is that we enjoy the Son of God
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   with the very joy of God the Father.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.760]   And we should add, Jesus had already said, I don't know if you've ever put this together,
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.160]   in John 15, 11, "I've spoken these things to you that," what?
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.960]   "That my joy might be in you."
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   So now you not only have Jesus praying for the love of the Father for the Son to become
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:08.120]   my love for the Son, but you have Jesus saying, "And my joy, my joy in the Father, I have
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.480]   spoken to you so that my joy would be in you."
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.560]   There's no other way for your joy to be full than for my joy in God to become your joy
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.160]   in God, so that now we have our joy in the Father being the Son's joy in the Father,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.160]   and our joy in the Son being the Father's joy in the Son.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:36.560]   And we must have a new resurrection body or we will be blown to smithereens by that experience.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.400]   And that's not a joke at all.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.520]   That is why you must have a new body.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:51.640]   These experiences are so magnificent that this flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.640]   of God.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.960]   That doesn't mean you won't have a resurrection body.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.880]   It means this one won't work.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.080]   This one will not work for that experience forever.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.080]   Amen.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:09.720]   A new body is necessary for us to experience the fullness of joy in God's presence forever.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.720]   That is powerful.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.520]   I love this clip from John Piper's message on April 23rd, 2014.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.500]   The message is titled "The Glory of God and the Gladness of Man."
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.240]   It was delivered at the Carl F.H.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.340]   Henry Center for Theological Understanding at Trinity International University near Chicago.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.000]   You can find that entire message by searching for it at DesiringGod.org.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.740]   Again, the title is "The Glory of God and the Gladness of Man."
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.740]   And thanks for listening.

[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.960]   Well we close out the week talking about global warming.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.200]   Yes, global warming.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.000]   Should it change how Christians live?
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   How and why?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.800]   That's up next time on Friday.
