[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.940]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.160]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.520]   Today, we are going to talk all about healthy
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.240]   and disordered eating.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.480]   And indeed, we are going to talk
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.480]   about clinical eating disorders,
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.100]   such as anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder,
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.280]   as well as some other related eating disorders.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.360]   However, before we get into this material,
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.920]   I want to emphasize that today's discussion will include
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.320]   what it is to have a healthy relationship with food.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.560]   We're going to talk about metabolism.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.400]   We're going to talk about how eating frequency
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.680]   and what one eats influences things like appetite
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.840]   and satiety, as well as whether or not we have
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.680]   a healthy psychological relationship to food
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.520]   and our body weight and so-called body composition,
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.760]   the ratio of muscle to fat to bone, et cetera.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.040]   So as we march into this conversation,
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.160]   I'd like to share with you some interesting
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.080]   and what I believe are important findings
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.120]   in the realm of nutrition and human behavior.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.120]   I know these days, many people are excited about
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.700]   or curious about so-called intermittent fasting.
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.720]   Intermittent fasting is, as the name implies,
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.940]   simply restricting one's feeding behavior,
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.360]   eating to a particular phase of the 24 hour
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.200]   or so-called circadian cycle.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.520]   Other forms of intermittent fasting involve
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.240]   not eating for extended periods of time,
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.360]   for an entire days, or some people will extend
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.040]   to two days or three days, typically,
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.580]   and hopefully they will drink water during those times,
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.280]   sometimes referred to as water fasting,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.200]   which means that they are ingesting fluids
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.160]   and hopefully they are ingesting electrolytes
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.000]   such as salt, potassium, and magnesium as well,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.480]   because while one can survive for some period of time
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.860]   without ingesting calories, it is extremely important
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.000]   to continue to ingest plenty of fluids and electrolytes.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.380]   And the reason for that is that the neurons
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.560]   of your brain and body that control your movements,
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.940]   your thoughts, clarity of thinking in general, et cetera,
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.140]   is critically dependent on the presence
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.080]   of adequate levels of sodium, potassium, and magnesium,
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.300]   the electrolytes, and that's because neurons
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.140]   can only be electrically active by way of movement
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.820]   of particular ions, which include things like sodium,
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.320]   potassium, and magnesium.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.660]   So without those, you can't think, you can't function,
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.600]   and it actually can be quite dangerous.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.860]   So why all the excitement about intermittent fasting?
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.700]   Well, a lot of the excitement relates to work
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.700]   that was done by a former colleague of mine
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.900]   down at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.460]   in San Diego named Sachin Panda.
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.040]   Sachin's lab identified some very important
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.220]   and impactful health benefits
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.200]   of restricting one's feeding window to particular times
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.020]   within the 24-hour cycle, or even to having extended fasts
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.980]   that go for a day or two days, or maybe even three days.
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.700]   What they saw was an improvement in liver enzymes,
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.880]   an improvement in insulin sensitivity,
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.420]   which is something that is good.
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.120]   It means that you can utilize the calories
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.120]   and the blood sugar that you happen to have.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.980]   Being insulin-insensitive is not good
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.280]   and is actually a form of diabetes.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.040]   What Sachin's lab and subsequently other labs showed
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.100]   was that restricting one's feeding window
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.860]   to anywhere from four to eight or even 12 hours
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.440]   during each 24-hour cycle was beneficial in mice.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.660]   And some studies in humans have also shown
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.200]   that it can be beneficial for various health parameters.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.060]   However, the excitement about intermittent fasting
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.980]   seems to be related to the foundational truth
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.260]   about metabolism and weight loss and weight maintenance
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.360]   and weight gain, which is that regardless of whether or not
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.300]   you intermittent fast or whether or not you eat small meals
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.140]   all day long, or you eat one meal in the evening
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.380]   and snack up until then, it really doesn't matter
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.020]   in the sense that the calories that you ingest
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.040]   from whatever source are going to be filtered
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.220]   through the calories that you burn by way of exercise,
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.460]   basal metabolic rate, which is just the calories
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.360]   that you happen to burn, just being alive and thinking
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.700]   and breathing and your heart beating, et cetera.
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.720]   And the reason why many people prefer intermittent fasting
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.740]   to other forms of, let's just call it what it is,
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.140]   diet or nutritional framework is that many people
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.020]   find it easier to not eat than to limit their portion size.
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.900]   And here I'm not talking necessarily about eating disorders,
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.880]   I'm talking about the general population.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.500]   So I think that's one reason why there's so much excitement
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.460]   about intermittent fasting.
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.620]   Now, within the context of intermittent fasting
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.880]   on a circadian timescale once every 24 hours,
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.420]   you generally find two categories of people.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.940]   People who prefer to not eat in the morning,
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.040]   either because they are not hungry in the morning
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.780]   or because they find it relatively straightforward
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.020]   to just drink things like coffee or water, et cetera,
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.120]   and push their feeding window out to noon or 2 p.m.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.600]   or 3 p.m., and then they'll eat between say 1 p.m.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.140]   and 8 p.m. or 9 p.m., it depends on the individual.
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.500]   Other groups of people find that they are very hungry
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.820]   when they wake up in the morning,
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.060]   they don't feel well if they don't eat breakfast.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.380]   And so they prefer to eat early in the day,
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.860]   but then they limit their feeding window
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.720]   such that they cut off their food intake
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.420]   or stop ingesting any calories of any kind
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.260]   somewhere around 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., et cetera.
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.020]   So the duration of the feeding window
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.900]   has not been broken down
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.460]   into the kind of nuanced type of information
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.940]   that one would really want,
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.060]   at least not in human studies,
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.980]   saying, well, a six-hour feeding window
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.200]   or an eight-hour feeding window is ideal.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.280]   It really is going to vary
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.100]   based on lifestyle and circumstances.
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.020]   For instance, some families
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.320]   really want to eat dinner together every night.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.780]   So do you want to be the person
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.400]   that's sitting there watching everybody eat
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.420]   because you're fasting from 5 p.m. onward?
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.660]   I don't know, that's an individual difference.
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.580]   What you can start to identify, however,
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.700]   is that people tend to fall
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.260]   into either one category or the other,
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.480]   people who prefer to skip eating in the morning
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.140]   or people that prefer to
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.180]   or manage to skip eating in the evening.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.240]   And there has been no evidence thus far
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.780]   that one is better or worse,
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.440]   at least in terms of weight loss or overall health parameters.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.900]   Now, you could imagine
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.720]   that some people might eat breakfast and dinner.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.460]   And indeed, I have several, many colleagues, in fact,
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.800]   who just choose to skip lunch
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.780]   because they're busy during the day.
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.480]   They eat breakfast and dinner.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.060]   That doesn't afford the long fast associated with sleep.
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.900]   What do I mean by that?
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.760]   Well, if you went to sleep at 11 p.m.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.840]   and you wake up at 6 a.m.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.220]   by extending your fast until 1 p.m. in the afternoon,
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.840]   you get quite a long period of no ingesting any calories.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.660]   Whereas when you don't eat during the middle of the day,
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.180]   you are getting a fasting period
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.340]   that's probably anywhere from four to seven hours,
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.260]   but it's not linked to the longer fasting period
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.400]   of not eating while you are asleep.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.100]   Because most all people, and I want to emphasize most,
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.180]   do not eat while they are asleep.
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.380]   But we are going to talk about an eating disorder
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.180]   that does exist where people actually eat in their sleep.
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.600]   I know it sounds pretty wild,
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.640]   but indeed that eating disorder does exist
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.120]   and has a very interesting underlying mechanism.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.620]   So why are we talking about this?
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.560]   And in particular, why are we talking about this
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.700]   during an episode that includes a discussion
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.620]   about eating disorders?
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.160]   The reason is nobody, not the government,
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.720]   no nutritionists, no individual,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.480]   no matter how knowledgeable they are
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.280]   about food and nutrition and food intake
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.280]   can define the best plan for eating for any one individual.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.020]   I'm going to repeat that.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.460]   Nobody knows what truly healthy eating is.
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.820]   We only know the measurements we can take.
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.940]   Liver enzymes, blood, lipid profiles, body weight,
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.700]   athletic performance, mental performance,
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.100]   whether or not you're cranky all day,
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.880]   whether or not you're feeling relaxed,
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.380]   nobody knows how to define these.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.680]   And these have strong cultural and familial
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.180]   and socio societal influence.
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.380]   So if you hang out with people
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.420]   that intermittent fast all day, that will seem normal.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.860]   If you spend time with people
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.620]   that have never heard of intermittent fasting,
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.780]   intermittent fasting is going to seem very abnormal.
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.760]   Now we are going to talk about eating disorders
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.360]   that really fall into the category
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.500]   of clinically diagnosable eating disorders
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.580]   for which there's actually serious health hazards
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.820]   and even the serious risk of death.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.420]   We will get to that topic.
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.640]   But for the time being,
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.660]   I want to emphasize a new set of findings
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.400]   that I think many people will find interesting
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.200]   and at least will want to consider
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.540]   in light of their current nutritional plan
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.300]   or pattern of eating,
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.840]   whether or not you're intermittent fasting or not.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.640]   And I want to cue up an important framework
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.020]   for the rest of the conversation
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.020]   on healthy and disordered eating,
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.640]   which includes an understanding of thinking,
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.680]   decision-making and what we call homeostatic processes,
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.260]   meaning regulation of things
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.820]   that are going on in our brain and body
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.180]   and reward mechanisms.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.100]   I'm going to return to that in a moment.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.640]   But first I want to share with you these new findings
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.800]   that were just published in the journal Cell Reports,
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.020]   a cell press journal, excellent journal.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.900]   This was a study that was performed both in mice
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.500]   and it included a crossover study with a human population.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.580]   The human population was women,
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.620]   but it relates to a previous study
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.600]   that was also carried out in men.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.820]   I'm going to simplify this study.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.620]   We will provide a link to the full study
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.320]   so you can explore it in more detail.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.160]   And if you're really excited about the results,
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.120]   I would encourage you to explore some of the references
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.500]   within that paper as well.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.760]   What was the study?
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.760]   The study looked at giving mice or humans two meals
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.800]   and explored whether or not putting those meals
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.360]   early in the day or late in the day
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.760]   had an impact on muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth,
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.400]   and overall protein synthesis of muscle.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.820]   So when we eat, the amino acids from various foods
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.360]   are broken down and synthesized
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.600]   into different types of tissues.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.080]   They can be utilized for energy,
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.680]   burned up for moving about and thinking, et cetera,
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.040]   or those amino acids can be synthesized
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.060]   into skeletal muscle, the sorts of skill to muscles
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.760]   that allow you to move your limbs.
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.540]   This study explored how protein intake,
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.500]   which included what are called branch chain amino acids
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.220]   and amino acids like leucine,
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.360]   which are important for muscle protein synthesis.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.880]   It explored whether or not emphasizing
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:02.880]   or skewing the protein intake toward early day or late day
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.880]   was better in terms of muscle hypertrophy.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.940]   And they also looked at some parameters of strength
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.820]   like grip strength.
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.920]   Now, mice are nocturnal.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.760]   So before you say, wait, mice are nocturnal,
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.840]   how did they look during the day?
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.360]   And it's completely, it doesn't apply 'cause it's in mice.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.260]   Of course, they knew that.
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.280]   And they looked during the mice's active phase
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.840]   of their circadian cycle, which corresponds to our day.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.800]   And in humans, they looked at whether or not
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.440]   eating most of one's protein early in the day
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.420]   was better than if the protein intake
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.180]   and these branch chain amino acids
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.160]   were placed later in the day.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.200]   And yes, they had the mice do resistance training.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.360]   They did that by emphasizing overload
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.960]   to one limb of the mouse.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.520]   And that actually generates hypertrophy.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.940]   It's a form of resistance training in mice.
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.480]   So they don't have them weight training.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.000]   They weren't doing curls and dips and squats
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.960]   and things of that sort.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.320]   They were moving their own body weight,
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.660]   but they skewed that distribution of body weight
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.120]   by restricting a limb and forcing them to use one limb
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.480]   that did indeed grow in response to that.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.400]   And then in humans, there was an exploration of grip strength
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.160]   and then with resistance training,
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.460]   that was also carried out through a peripheral study.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.840]   Basically, the takeaway from this study
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.840]   was that mice and humans can utilize amino acids
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.940]   that are ingested early in the day
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.360]   better than they can utilize amino acids
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.240]   ingested later in the day.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.960]   In particular, toward muscle hypertrophy and growth
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.360]   or maintenance of muscle,
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.180]   which for those of you that aren't interested
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.480]   in much muscle hypertrophy,
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.020]   that aren't trying to grow your muscles,
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.640]   I've talked before in the episode
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.360]   on building strength and hypertrophy,
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.580]   that maintaining muscle,
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.840]   regardless of one's athletic prowess,
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.400]   regardless of one's age is extremely important
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.240]   because loss of skeletal muscle
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.960]   is one of the major causes of injury as we age.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.480]   It's one of the major causes, believe it or not,
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.160]   of cognitive and metabolic deficits as we age.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.800]   So maintaining muscle is important,
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.600]   building muscle might be important to some of you,
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.320]   but what they found was ingesting protein early in the day
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.800]   and these amino acids early in the day
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.480]   led to more muscle hypertrophy
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.880]   than if the majority of amino acids and proteins
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.480]   were ingested late in the day.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.220]   So this translates to intermittent fasting
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.840]   such that if you are interested in muscle hypertrophy,
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.720]   you might, and I want to emphasize might,
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.560]   consider making sure that you're getting
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.600]   sufficient protein intake early in the day.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.080]   What sources of protein you use
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.360]   is going to be highly individual.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.680]   Some of you are meat eaters,
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.120]   some of you don't eat red meat,
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.980]   some of you eat chicken and fish and eggs,
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.920]   some of you don't, some of you are vegans.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.480]   It has been shown that the amino acid leucine
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.000]   is vital for the cell growth process,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.380]   including muscle growth because of its relationship
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.000]   to the so-called mTOR pathway,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.240]   mammalian target of rapamycin.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.160]   We can talk about that more if you like
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.340]   in a future episode.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.080]   This means that if you're somebody who wants to maintain
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.440]   or increase the amount of muscle mass that you have,
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.680]   ingesting a high protein meal early in the day
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.900]   ought to be beneficial for that.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.960]   Does it mean that you should not eat protein
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.960]   in the afternoon and evening?
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.180]   No, I think a lot of people might have misinterpreted
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.880]   this study and I don't want that to happen.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.880]   This is only pointing out the fact
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.280]   that ingesting sufficient quality amino acids,
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.600]   including leucine, early in the day
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.360]   can be beneficial for maintenance
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.880]   and growth of muscle tissue.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.680]   It does not say that you should avoid protein
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.000]   later in the day.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.500]   Now for you intermittent fasters, this could be relevant.
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.460]   I, for instance, was somebody who for a very long time
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.600]   skipped breakfast.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.240]   My first meal of the day would be in the early afternoon,
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.560]   mostly protein and salad.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.840]   In my case, animal protein,
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.760]   'cause that's in alignment with my values.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.400]   Then in the evening I would eat pasta, vegetables, et cetera.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.360]   I might have some protein, some small piece of fish
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.360]   or chicken or something like that,
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.660]   but I didn't really emphasize that.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.560]   On the basis of these results, I am experimenting with,
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.160]   I want to emphasize, experimenting with,
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.740]   I haven't completely tossed out my old protocol,
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.700]   but I'm experimenting with eating proteins early in the day
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.800]   and eating lunch and then dinner might be a light supper
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.500]   of some sort, but not so much protein later in the evening.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.200]   Again, if you want to eat six meals a day,
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.140]   you want to eat around the clock, I'm not going to stop you.
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.420]   I'm not telling anybody what to do.
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.000]   As I mentioned earlier, nobody knows exactly how to eat
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.320]   for one's particular goals,
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.800]   but this study was really interesting
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.140]   because it really did show that we can utilize the proteins
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.460]   that are ingested early in the day better
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.720]   than we can utilize the proteins
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.360]   that are ingested later in the day.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.860]   And of course, there will be factors that can shift that.
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.520]   For instance, if you work out very hard
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.400]   with resistance training later in the day,
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.820]   resistance training is known to increase protein synthesis.
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.640]   So it stands to reason that ingesting amino acids
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.760]   after that training would be beneficial.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.340]   However, in the study, it did not seem to matter
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.860]   when the resistance training fell
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.480]   within the 24 hour schedule.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.120]   The morning ingestion or early day ingestion of amino acids
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.400]   seemed to be beneficial.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.240]   How early?
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.640]   Between the hours of about 5 a.m. and 10 a.m. for humans.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.860]   Now, just a bit of mechanism to explain why this happens.
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.920]   So why would it be that ingesting protein early in the day
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.120]   would lead to more synthesis of muscle
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.400]   than ingesting protein later in the day?
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.160]   And the reason it turns out
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.920]   is related to the circadian clock mechanism
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.840]   that is present in all cells, including muscle cells.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.060]   So muscles have fibers.
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.380]   I think most people are aware of that,
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.040]   that your muscles are not just one big blob of tissue.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.480]   A lot of these little fibers that contract.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:44.080]   Within those fibers, however, there are cells with nuclei.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.720]   Those nuclei contain DNA.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.640]   DNA is transcribed into RNA.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.400]   RNA is translated into proteins.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.800]   The DNA of your cells, including these muscle cells,
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.880]   are under strong circadian regulation.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.600]   Each one has a pattern of gene expression
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.500]   that is different at different times
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.020]   during the 24 hour cycle.
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:09.960]   This is an unescapable reality of all cells in your body,
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.140]   right from your hair cells to your brain cells,
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.200]   to your retinal cells, to your toe on both feet.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.940]   These cells make a gene called BMAL, BMAL, B-M-A-L,
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.160]   is a clock gene.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.080]   And the expression of this clock gene
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.400]   varies across the 24 hour cycle.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.800]   And proteins that are downstream of this BMAL gene
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.520]   influence protein synthesis.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.440]   The circadian regulation of this BMAL gene
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.220]   turns out to be vitally important
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.200]   for this protein synthesis mechanism.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.060]   How do we know that?
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.640]   Well, in this particular study,
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.160]   because they had a mouse that lacked BMAL,
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.760]   the gene was knocked out.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.800]   They had a bunch of these mice.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.000]   They were able to explore
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.960]   whether or not this early day feeding effect
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.440]   was present or absent in these mice
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.540]   that lack the gene BMAL, and indeed it was absent.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.600]   In other words, the effect of increased protein synthesis
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.240]   early in the day was eliminated
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.140]   in the absence of the BMAL gene.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.760]   So what this means is that when you wake up in the morning,
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.760]   assuming you're following a standard schedule
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.600]   of being asleep at night and awake during the day,
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.040]   your muscle cells are primed to incorporate amino acids
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.640]   and synthesize muscle,
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.360]   regardless of whether or not you wait-trained
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.080]   the night before at 8 p.m.,
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.260]   where you don't wait-train at all,
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.220]   or you wait-train afterwards or before.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.840]   I said 5 to 10 p.m. is the sort of critical window
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.720]   for this increased protein synthesis.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.600]   All this means is that if you are interested in maintaining
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.220]   or enhancing muscle tissue volume,
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.840]   that you might want to consider eating quality protein
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.280]   and amino acids early in the day.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.700]   You could train first, you could train after,
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.100]   you could not train at all.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.180]   That's an entirely different discussion.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.720]   What is quality protein?
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.640]   Well, quality protein is going to be a protein
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.420]   that includes most of the essential amino acids
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.780]   and in particular, leucine.
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.920]   Now, there's a lot of debate as to whether or not
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.160]   you can get all the essential amino acids
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.640]   from a purely plant-based diet
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.160]   or whether or not you need to ingest
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.360]   animal-based foods or not.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.160]   The term quality protein has no strict scientific definition.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.280]   Some people define quality protein as a protein
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.840]   that has a high essential amino acid to caloric ratio.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.500]   Now, what that means is a small piece of chicken or steak
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.660]   or eggs, for instance, will have many essential amino acids
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:37.360]   with a low caloric content relative to, say,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.520]   beans or plant-based foods
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.760]   that can also get you essential amino acids,
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.360]   but it requires more calories
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.080]   to access those essential amino acids.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.440]   Now, that's a debate that has many exceptions and nuances.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.300]   And I, for one, am perfectly respectful of the folks
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.960]   that just want to ingest plant-based foods
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.880]   in order to get their high quality protein.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.800]   I think that actually can be done.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.580]   One has to be careful and thoughtful in their choices
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.620]   about how to do that.
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.660]   So this really isn't about animal-based
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.420]   versus non-animal-based foods.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.240]   This is about getting quality amino acids early in the day
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.140]   from whatever foods are in alignment
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.580]   with your particular values in your particular eating plan.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.620]   So that's a lot of information,
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.920]   but the key takeaways are every cell in your muscles
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.320]   has a clock gene.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.180]   The clock genes vary such that protein synthesis
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.420]   is greater early in the day than it is later in the day,
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.340]   such that in both mice and in humans,
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.500]   ingestion of quality proteins early in the day
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.660]   will be more so incorporated into muscle
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.300]   than the proteins that are ingested late in the day.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.260]   And of course, there are the caveats
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.640]   of if you're training hard late in the day,
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.540]   if you're adjusting your hormone status
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.060]   through whatever mechanism, et cetera,
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.920]   protein synthesis can also be high later in the day.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.660]   But for most people, it's going to taper off
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.460]   due to this circadian B-mal gene-related mechanism.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.780]   Again, we will provide a link to the study.
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.140]   And the other key takeaways were that nobody knows,
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.220]   nobody can tell you what healthy feeding windows are,
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.720]   what the best feeding windows are.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.220]   There's absolutely no information in that context.
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:18.220]   You talk to 10 nutritionists or academics or trainers
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.620]   or individuals about what healthy eating is,
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.900]   and you are going to get vastly different answers.
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.820]   And that's one of the reasons why I believe that
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.060]   the internet, in particular social media,
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.780]   are so filled with contradictory opinions.
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:35.620]   But the calories in versus calories burned formula
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.580]   is the more or less holy foundation
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.420]   of all things about nutrition, eating, and weight.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.540]   And as we transition today into the discussion
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.060]   about eating disorders, I'd like you to keep this in mind
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.600]   because for the treatment of eating disorders,
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.720]   it doesn't matter what psychological
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.560]   or early trauma-based effects led to the eating disorder
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.540]   if the person isn't adjusting their feeding behavior
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.020]   in a way that is going to ameliorate the symptoms
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.860]   of that disorder, which is ultimately the goal.
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.400]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.320]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.500]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.180]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.120]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.180]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.160]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.700]   Our first sponsor is Belcampo.
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.440]   Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.260]   that raises organic, grass-fed, and finished
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.460]   certified humane meats.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:36.200]   I don't eat a lot of meat, but I eat meat about once a day.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.420]   That means a small piece of steak or chicken, et cetera,
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.900]   and usually a salad.
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.900]   I usually do that for breakfast or for lunch.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.820]   And then in the evening,
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.380]   I tend to follow a more or less vegetarian diet.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.380]   I tend to eat pastas and vegetables and things of that sort.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.120]   While I don't eat a lot of meat,
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.460]   it's important that the meat that I eat
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.100]   be of very high quality and that I am certain
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.760]   that the animals were raised and treated humanely
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.060]   up until the point of slaughter.
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.120]   Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.160]   and seasonal grasses their entire lives,
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.780]   resulting in meat that's higher in nutrients
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:08.840]   and healthy fats.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.620]   It also results in healthy, happy cows.
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:16.020]   I often talk about how important omega-3 fatty acids are.
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.800]   They've been shown to be important for regulating mood,
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.900]   for the microbiome, for restricting inflammation in the brain
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.280]   and elsewhere in the body.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.080]   Belcampo's meats are known to be high in omega-3s.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.340]   And given that the meat is grass fed and grass finished,
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.740]   that combines all the features of the nutrition
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.540]   and the animal wellbeing that I want to see
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.940]   for any meat that I ingest.
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.180]   If you'd like to try Belcampo,
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.220]   first-time customers can get 20% off
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.100]   by going to belcampo.com/huberman

[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.580]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.160]   Headspace is a meditation app that's backed by 25
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:01.160]   published studies and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.680]   I've been meditating for a very long time,
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.940]   although I admit I meditate on and off,
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.880]   meaning I'll go a few weeks or months,
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.960]   meditating regularly, and then I tend to stop.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.920]   A few years ago, I got into a regular meditation practice
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.280]   because I started using Headspace's meditation app.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.100]   The thing I really like about their meditation app
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.320]   is it has meditations of different durations.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.460]   So sometimes I'll just meditate for three minutes
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.160]   or five minutes, or ideally,
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.060]   I'm doing two 20-minute sessions per day,
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.300]   but I confess I don't always manage that.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.220]   But they have a ton of different meditations
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.180]   on the Headspace app that allow you
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.060]   to tailor your meditation practice
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.060]   to your particular schedule.
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.140]   And there are now a plethora of studies
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.500]   showing the benefits of a regular meditation practice.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.620]   If you want to try Headspace,
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.900]   you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.340]   And if you do that, you'll get a free one-month trial
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.680]   with Headspace's full library of meditations.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.520]   You get them all.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.660]   That's the best deal offered by Headspace right now.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:55.660]   So again, if you're interested,
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.060]   go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.900]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.140]   Athletic Greens is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink,
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.440]   and it's one that I've been drinking since 2012.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.280]   The reason I started drinking Athletic Greens
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.340]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.000]   is that it really helps me cover all of my nutritional bases
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.520]   with respect to vitamins and minerals and probiotics.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.420]   And we now know that a healthy gut microbiome
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.740]   is supported by probiotics.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.680]   And for me, Athletic Greens is the best way
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.180]   to get those probiotics.
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.760]   I also ingest some fermented foods,
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.380]   but by ingesting Athletic Greens,
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.740]   I'm certain to get all the things I need.
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.300]   And also I just feel better when I drink it.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.120]   I genuinely feel like I have more energy
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.420]   and I just feel better.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.260]   And I happen to really like the way it tastes.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.180]   I mix mine with some water and some lemon juice.
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.120]   And in doing that,
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.920]   I'm certain to get all of my nutritional bases covered.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.500]   And the probiotics support a healthy gut microbiome
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.540]   which is important for mood, regulating inflammation,
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.880]   and so on.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.260]   If you want to try Athletic Greens,
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.180]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.660]   And if you do that, you can claim a special offer.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.180]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.980]   in addition to your Athletic Greens order.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.580]   Those travel packs make it really easy
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.020]   to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road,
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.580]   in the car, on the plane, et cetera.
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.860]   And they will give you a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.640]   Vitamin D3 and K2 have been shown to be important
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.020]   for blood lipid profiles, for metabolism,
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:22.380]   and a whole bunch of other metabolic and neural processes.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.020]   So go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.060]   to get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.640]   and the year supply of D3 and K2.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.860]   So let's talk about eating disorders.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.100]   And as we do that, I want to emphasize again
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.360]   that nobody can really define what healthy eating is
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.620]   with a single protocol.
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.320]   However, there is some general agreement
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.320]   about what unhealthy and disordered eating is.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.780]   There are clear criteria in the psychiatric
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.000]   and psychological communities to define things
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.040]   like anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder,
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.780]   all of which we will talk about.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.980]   But as we have that discussion,
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.540]   I want to emphasize that self-diagnosis
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:03.900]   can be both a terrific, but also a very precarious thing.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.060]   We talked about this a little bit
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.060]   in the episode about depression.
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.540]   There's always a temptation as one learns
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.780]   about the symptomology of a given disorder,
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.140]   doesn't really matter what the disorder is,
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.180]   to ask the question, well, do I have that?
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.900]   Does so-and-so that I know have that,
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.740]   ah, I see this sort of behavior
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.220]   or that pattern of thinking in that individual?
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.140]   It's tempting to diagnose them and or ourselves
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.460]   as either having or not having a particular disorder.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:32.920]   However, diagnoses really need to be carried out
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.320]   by people who are trained in that particular field
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.780]   and that have deep expertise in recognizing the symptomology,
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.100]   including some of the more subtle symptomology
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.340]   of eating disorders.
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.600]   So if any of the symptoms resonate with you
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.740]   by way of you thinking that you have
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.780]   this particular disorder or someone that you know
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.940]   has a disorder, I would take that seriously,
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.720]   but I would take that information
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.780]   to a qualified healthcare professional
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.500]   that could diagnose or rule out
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.380]   any of these possible disorders.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.660]   I say that not to protect us, but to protect you,
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.340]   because information is valuable.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.040]   And I do believe that knowledge of knowledge
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.800]   can be very valuable in navigating any topic
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.860]   and improving our thoughts and behaviors around that topic.
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.120]   But one doesn't want to,
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.100]   or I should say one shouldn't start to self-diagnose
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.060]   simply on the basis of information
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.940]   without running that through the filter
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.720]   of a qualified professional.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.940]   So what is an eating disorder?
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.580]   Well, we have to take a step back
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:35.660]   and confess to the fact that every society, every culture,
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.660]   every family and every individual
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.300]   has a different relationship to food.
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.740]   Eating disorders, however, have particular criteria
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.160]   that allow us to define them
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.180]   and to think about different modes of treatment
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.880]   as it relates to the particular symptoms,
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.440]   in particular the psychological
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.400]   and biological symptoms of those disorders.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.080]   Now that's a mouthful, no pun intended.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.920]   What are the major eating disorders?
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:06.600]   Anorexia nervosa, most commonly referred to as anorexia,
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.680]   is perhaps the most prevalent
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.100]   and the most dangerous of all eating disorders.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.100]   In fact, anorexia is the most dangerous
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.520]   psychiatric disorder of all, even more than depression.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:24.620]   The probability of death for untreated anorexia
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.240]   is very high.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.900]   And sadly, the prevalence of anorexia is very high.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.500]   So what is anorexia and how prevalent is it?
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.660]   Anorexia, if you look it up online
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.540]   or you talk to a qualified professional,
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:40.420]   is essentially a failure to eat enough to maintain
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.440]   a healthy weight.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.560]   You can see all sorts of very troubling symptoms
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.380]   of somebody who's been anorexic for some period of time.
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:52.260]   A general loss of muscle mass
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.540]   because they're ingesting fewer calories than they burn.
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.420]   Muscle is very metabolically active.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.840]   They tend to lose a lot of muscle mass.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.020]   They will have a low heart rate.
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:06.620]   This is the body and brain's attempt to lower energy output.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.240]   They will have low blood pressure.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.900]   They will sometimes have symptoms like fainting.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.180]   They will have sometimes even hair growth on the face,
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.820]   something called lanugo,
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.580]   which is essentially the body's attempt to insulate the body
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.680]   because of loss of body heat when you're that thin.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.120]   Loss of bone density, osteoporosis,
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.820]   loss of periods in girls and women,
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:36.820]   and all sorts of disrupted gut and immune functions.
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:40.980]   So there are just tons of terrible symptoms of anorexia
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:45.700]   that really place the anorexic into a very risky state,
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.760]   which is why mortality from anorexia gone untreated
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.780]   is extremely high.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.660]   Now, one of the misconceptions about anorexia
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.060]   is that it stems from an overemphasis on perfectionism
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:04.260]   or that because of all the images in social media
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.720]   and in advertising of extremely thin and fit
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.220]   or muscular people,
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.740]   that individuals are looking at themselves
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.060]   and comparing themselves to those images
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.580]   and thinking that they don't match up
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.360]   in developing anorexia.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.100]   That turns out to not be the case.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.880]   If you look at the prevalence or the rates of anorexia
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.220]   in the last 10 years or 20 years,
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.720]   and you compare that to when anorexia was first identified,
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.100]   which was in the 1600s and perhaps even earlier,
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:38.500]   what you find is that rates of anorexia are not going up.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.460]   So this idea that the images that we're being bombarded with
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.160]   are causing anorexia doesn't seem to be true.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.060]   Now, that is not to say that the images that we,
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.940]   in particular young people are being bombarded with
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.940]   are healthy for their psychological state of mind,
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.620]   but classically defined anorexia has existed
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.380]   at essentially the same prevalence
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:03.640]   for the last 100, 200, 300, and 400 years,
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.540]   which is incredible and really speaks to the likelihood
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.420]   that there's a strong biological contribution
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.080]   to what we call anorexia nervosa.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.820]   Anorexia nervosa is extremely common.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:19.740]   It's anywhere from one to 2% of women.
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:24.020]   And the typical onset is in adolescents close to puberty,
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.920]   but it can show up later in life as well.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.860]   In fact, the identification and diagnosis of anorexia
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.420]   tends to be in the early 20s.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.520]   But if you look back at the history of those individuals,
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.840]   there were typically signs of anorexia
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.580]   that stem back into their early teens
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.560]   or maybe even before that.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.400]   Now, of course, men can be anorexic as well,
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.900]   but anorexia nervosa does seem to occur
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.940]   at 10 times the rate in women and young girls
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.060]   than it does in men and young boys.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.440]   So while there does seem to be more of a prevalence
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.620]   of anorexia in boys and young men these days,
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.460]   that's probably due to better diagnosis and detection
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.620]   than it is to some sort of societal shift
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.040]   related to imagery, et cetera.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.140]   Later, we will talk about body dysmorphia
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.500]   and some of the images that are present in media
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.820]   and social media and how those are impacting
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.080]   other forms of eating disorders.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.420]   But when you look at anorexia nervosa,
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.320]   this failure to maintain weight even to healthy levels
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.160]   and often drops in weight that are very dangerous
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:33.500]   or even deadly, that has existed for a very long time
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.220]   and seems to be somewhat hardwired into the biology
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.560]   of individuals that suffer from it.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.240]   Now, when I say hardwired, that doesn't mean
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.300]   that it can't be treated or cured and indeed it can.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:48.600]   Bulimia, which is defined as binge eating or overeating,
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.600]   let me explain what that is.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.160]   Binge eating is consuming vast amounts of calories
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.560]   in a short period of time.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:58.180]   Overeating can be ingesting more calories than one needs,
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.360]   but over an extended period of time,
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:05.040]   both can exist of course, but bulimia is also very common.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.480]   It's more common in young girls and in women
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.260]   that it is in young boys and in men,
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.560]   but it is present in both sexes.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:18.940]   Bulimia and rates of bulimia might be increasing.
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.360]   That's sort of an interesting finding.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.280]   It's not quite clear whether or not it's existed
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.240]   in its same form for a long period of time
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.400]   or whether or not there are new forms
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.760]   that are evolving or showing up.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.920]   We're going to drill into bulimia and what it actually is
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.280]   and what it represents.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.640]   But one thing I want to be clear about,
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:41.240]   just as the perfectionist mindset has been associated
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.260]   with anorexia and it turns out that's not the case.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.240]   It can be, but it's not always associated with anorexia.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.940]   There was the idea that bulimia is associated
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.500]   with early trauma in childhood, in particular sexual trauma.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.680]   And while that can be the case,
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.660]   there's no direct correlation between the two.
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:05.160]   Now, obviously psychological phenomena and trauma
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.020]   can have a profound impact on the way
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:10.380]   that the brain wires up and the way that people approach food
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.440]   and other types of behaviors.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.240]   But the sort of classic idea was that all anorexics
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.760]   are perfectionists, they want to perform well,
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.880]   it's all about control and autonomy.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.720]   And bulimics are kind of dysregulated and acting out
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.740]   against some early sexual trauma.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:29.840]   Those stereotypes of the psychological framework
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.180]   of anorexics and bulimics doesn't hold up
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.340]   when you look at the data.
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.960]   Many meta analyses have been done.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.720]   It just simply is not the case.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.160]   And in both instances, both anorexia and bulimia,
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.680]   they're clear biological underpinnings
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.260]   to what's driving the undereating or the overeating.
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.280]   So we're going to talk about the biology of undereating
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.680]   and overeating and appropriate levels of eating.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.000]   And by doing that, we will start to identify
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.400]   some of the mechanisms that serve as entry points
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.940]   for the treatment of both anorexia and bulimia.
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.080]   And as some of you are probably aware,
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.600]   anorexia and bulimia can be comorbid,
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.100]   they can exist with one another.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:16.140]   There are anorexics who will binge and then purge
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.580]   in order to maintain that unhealthily low weight.
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:24.040]   There are bulimics who fit the psychological criteria
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.060]   of anorexia.
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:28.440]   And so there's a lot of overlap between those two categories.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.720]   Now let's talk about the categorization for a second
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.640]   and why the categorization has led to now
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.560]   a bunch of other eating disorders
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.240]   as defined by the psychiatric community.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.860]   One of the classic symptoms of anorexia
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.360]   is a loss of menstrual cycles, loss of periods.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.580]   And the reason for that is when the body is undernourished,
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:52.000]   the body fat stores send signals to the brain
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.400]   to inform that the body is undernourished
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.160]   or they turn off the signals that say,
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.840]   look, there are enough body fat cells out here
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.080]   to support healthy metabolism
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.680]   and therefore let's shut down ovulation.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.040]   Literally signal sent from the fat and muscle to the brain
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.960]   and the brain, the hypothalamus and pituitary will send
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:15.020]   signals down to the ovaries or they will turn off
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:19.100]   the signals heading to the ovaries to deploy eggs,
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.720]   maturation of eggs and the follicle, et cetera.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   So there are instances in which people have anorexia
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.720]   or have bulimia,
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.600]   but are still maintaining healthy menstrual cycles
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.940]   or at least menstrual cycles.
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:36.860]   And that has led to a whole set of other categorizations
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.860]   of eating disorders, like binge eating disorder,
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.040]   where there tends to be a lot of overeating,
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.840]   but not the purging or categorizations of anorexia
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.060]   where in which people are under feeding,
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.960]   but they are not losing their periods.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.760]   And so these have a number of different names and acronyms.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.440]   Some of them include things like EDNOS.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.960]   EDNOS is eating disorder, not otherwise specified.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.160]   So that's a sub-categorization or OSFEDS.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.400]   So OSFEDS is other specified feeding or eating disorder.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.740]   So right now, if you were to look online
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.880]   or you're looking into the psychiatric
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.020]   and psychological textbooks,
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.220]   what you would find is that there's a huge constellation
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.060]   of eating disorders.
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.600]   Today, we're mainly going to talk about anorexia,
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.360]   bulimia, binge eating disorder, and body dysmorphia.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.940]   You can even find eating disorders like pica,
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.220]   where people actually ingest things like dirt
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:30.760]   or rocks or metal because they have a genuine appetite
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.600]   for those things.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.600]   I certainly do not recommend sampling any
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.800]   of those non-food items as foods.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.580]   It is incredibly dangerous.
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.480]   People often poison themselves.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.920]   They often can cause structural blockages.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.600]   Some people have died from those sorts of things,
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:50.520]   but nonetheless, there are aspects of our brain and biology
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.920]   that when disrupted can lead
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.660]   to very bizarre types of eating behavior.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.160]   Sometimes pica is caused by malnutrition, but not always.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.880]   And so today we're going to focus
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.980]   on the most prevalent eating disorders,
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.480]   but we are going to build up toward that understanding
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.040]   by looking at what healthy metabolism
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.960]   and eating and satiety and hunger looks like.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.340]   Because one, I realized that not everyone out there
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.680]   has an eating disorder.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:18.200]   And two, I want people to understand this relationship
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.920]   between how they think, the decisions they take
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.960]   about what they eat and how the body and the brain
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.640]   at subconscious levels are driving some
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.320]   of these behaviors, healthy or otherwise,
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.180]   because I do think that it can lead us
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:34.780]   to a better understanding of what healthy eating is
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.460]   for most of us and to increase compassion
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.100]   and hopefully even increased improvement
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.040]   in treatment of eating disorders
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.100]   for those that are suffering from them.
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.180]   So what is hunger and what is satiety?
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.100]   Satiety, of course, being sated
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.340]   or feeling like we've had enough food.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:55.740]   I want to remind people of the basic mechanisms
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.640]   by which the brain and body communicate.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.040]   This is vitally important, not just for this discussion,
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.440]   but for any discussion about how we think,
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.600]   how we behave, how we feel.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.280]   The body is communicating two types of information
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.680]   to the brain on a regular basis,
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.040]   but in particular around feeding.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.360]   And those two types of information
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:18.800]   are mechanical information and chemical information.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.360]   What do I mean by mechanical information?
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:24.200]   Well, if you take a deep breath and you hold your breath,
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.560]   what you'll find is that you can hold your breath
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.000]   a lot longer than if you exhale all your air
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.760]   and you hold your breath with lungs empty.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.860]   And the reason is not because when your lungs are full,
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.840]   you have enough oxygen and therefore
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.760]   you can hold your breath.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.280]   It's because when your lungs are full,
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.200]   a particular class of neurons called baroreceptors
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.200]   send information to the brain and say,
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.360]   there's pressure in the lungs.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.680]   And that means that there's probably oxygen in here.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.440]   And so the trigger to breathe is actually suppressed.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.720]   When your lungs are empty,
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.180]   even if you have plenty of oxygen in your system,
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.580]   those baroreceptors send a different signal to the brain,
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.580]   which is there's no oxygen in here and you should breathe.
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.420]   And so the impulse to breathe comes earlier.
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:05.320]   Likewise, when your stomach is full,
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.700]   it sends signals to your brain
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.660]   that are purely based on this mechanical fullness,
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:14.020]   has nothing to do with nutrients that says I'm full
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.680]   and therefore don't be as hungry.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.460]   Don't motivate to find or ingest food.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.260]   Whereas when our gut is empty,
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.220]   even if we have plenty of nutrients
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.260]   or plenty of body fat stores,
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.860]   we tend to focus on food a bit more.
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:31.660]   So volume and mechanical influences have a profound effect
[00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:35.620]   on how we think and what we consider doing or not doing.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.820]   Likewise, chemical effects.
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.180]   When we ingest food,
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:41.940]   our so-called blood sugar or blood glucose levels go up.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.460]   That information is signaled to the brain
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:48.940]   via neuronal pathways and hormonal pathways.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.420]   And in particular, there are neurons within our gut
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.240]   that signal to areas of our brainstem
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.140]   that are involved in satiety in our sense of having enough
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.380]   that there's food in our system.
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.480]   So that's chemical information.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:05.480]   So how are hunger and feeding and satiety regulated?
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.820]   By way of mechanical and chemical signaling.
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:12.780]   You have, I have, we all have neurons in our hypothalamus
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:17.560]   that trigger eating and neurons that trigger cessation
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.740]   or stopping of eating.
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:21.180]   We have an accelerator on eating and we have a break.
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.780]   And I covered all of this in a lot of detail
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.680]   in the episode on feeding and metabolism and hunger.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.760]   So if you want a lot more detail, see that episode.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.060]   But right now, I'm just going to give you the top contour
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:34.060]   of how all that works.
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.100]   Your hypothalamus is an area of your forebrain,
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.920]   which tells you it's in the front,
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.360]   but it's at the base of your forebrain,
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.380]   sits more or less above the roof of your mouth.
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:44.380]   The hypothalamus contains lots of different kinds of neurons,
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:48.020]   including neurons that stimulate sexual activity and desire,
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.080]   regulate your body temperature
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:55.080]   and control appetite and ceasing of eating and appetite.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.180]   There are two types of neurons
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.920]   within a particular area of your hypothalamus
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.200]   that are relevant here.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.720]   There are the so-called POMC neurons, okay?
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.860]   Pro opioid melanocortin neurons
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:13.580]   that tend to act as more of a break on appetite
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.040]   by way of another hormone
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.780]   called melanocyte stimulating hormone.
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.720]   And not so incidentally,
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.980]   when you're getting a lot of sunlight
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.260]   and you're viewing a lot of sunlight,
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.160]   that system is ramped up.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.920]   This is why appetite is lower in the summer months
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.440]   than it is in the winter months.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.840]   This is true in animals and this is true in humans.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.020]   And you have a class of neurons called the AGRP neurons.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.680]   The AGRP neurons are the ones that stimulate feeding
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.640]   and they create a sort of anxiety or excitement about food.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.480]   Can be positive anxiety or it can be negative anxiety.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.460]   What do I mean by that?
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.860]   Well, have you ever seen kids heading in to get ice cream?
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.200]   They're absolutely excited.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.920]   You see people getting ready to sit down
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.400]   and eat a big meal.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.500]   They're excited to eat.
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.280]   Sometimes that's due to social factors,
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.640]   but they have an increase in overall levels
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.160]   of autonomic arousal.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.640]   And depending on the context,
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.280]   they can feel excited or anxious,
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.260]   but it is a ramping up of energy.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.480]   These AGRP neurons are what caused that.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.420]   In fact, so much so that if you eliminate
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:13.400]   or kill these neurons,
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.140]   which has been done in experimental mouse models
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:16.980]   in the laboratory,
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.760]   but also there are humans that have lesions
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.940]   or neurotoxic effects on these AGRP neurons.
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.080]   And what you find is that they don't want to eat.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.480]   They essentially become anorexic,
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.280]   meaning they don't want to ingest food.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.220]   They have no appetite for food whatsoever.
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.400]   Now that's not exactly what anorexia is,
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.840]   but these AGRP neurons are like an accelerator
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.920]   on wanting to eat.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.600]   Whereas if you stimulate these AGRP neurons
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.360]   or in humans that have say a small tumor
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.920]   near these AGRP neurons, they become hyperphagic.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.060]   They will eat to the point of bursting,
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:49.780]   both animals and humans that have elevated levels
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.660]   of these AGRP neurons are anxious.
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.260]   They want to eat and they will ingest food
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.420]   to the point where they override those mechanical
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.760]   and chemical signals in the body.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.180]   And I know it sounds horrible and it is horrible.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:04.100]   They will eat until the point that they burst.
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:07.280]   Now there are signals coming back from the body
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.160]   to inform the brain about presence
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.100]   of different levels of nutrients.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.420]   And that generally comes from three sources.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:16.720]   First of all, is body fat.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.040]   The more body fat we have,
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.440]   the more we secrete a hormone called leptin,
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.320]   L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin from body fat.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:27.140]   Leptin goes to the brain and suppresses appetite.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:30.460]   This is a body to brain signaling mechanism that says,
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.580]   look, I've had enough.
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:36.480]   Not incidentally, leptin signaling is disrupted
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.680]   in people that have bulimia and obesity
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.440]   and certain forms of binge eating disorder.
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.680]   So that system is disrupted.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.440]   I've had enough signal or there's enough body fat here
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.760]   such that you don't need to eat more.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.880]   Right here, I'm sort of in the voice of the body fat
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:52.920]   trying to talk to the brain.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.080]   That signal, that dialogue is mixed up or messed up.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.340]   In some cases, it's absent entirely.
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.780]   So the body fat is signaling to the brain
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.780]   about how much reserve you have.
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:05.120]   It's sort of like a savings account for energy
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.520]   'cause that's what body fat is.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.480]   You've got lipids in there and through lipolysis,
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.480]   they can be metabolized.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.000]   If you're interested in that process,
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.240]   both how to increase it and just generally how it works,
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.480]   you can see the episode on the science of fat loss.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.480]   The body fat is doing something else really interesting
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.860]   that relates to anorexia.
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.800]   When there's sufficient levels of body fat
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.240]   and leptin circulating in the blood
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.920]   and that leptin signal gets to the brain,
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.480]   the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:37.440]   register that signal and in a completely subconscious way,
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:41.880]   trigger the deployment of eggs in females
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.900]   and the production of sperm in males.
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:47.140]   So when body fat stores are very low,
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.200]   the reason why periods shut off
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.200]   or sperm production is reduced or even shut off
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.980]   is because there's not enough leptin
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.680]   getting to the hypothalamus and to the pituitary
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.460]   and they shut off the signals, the hormones,
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.120]   things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.360]   luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone,
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.840]   all these hormones that you don't have to remember
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.980]   the names of if you don't want to,
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.280]   that travel to the ovary or to the testes
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.840]   and cause the ovary and testes to ovulate
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.560]   or to produce more sperm.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.320]   So the reason why anorexics stop having periods
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.600]   when they stop cycling
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:24.000]   is because there isn't sufficient leptin in the bloodstream.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.520]   Now, there have been attempts to give leptin to anorexics
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.560]   because leptin has been sequenced
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.640]   and the peptide has been synthesized
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.320]   and so you can inject leptin into people.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.480]   There are studies where they've done that.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.420]   When that happens, it does not tend
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.840]   to alleviate the anorexia.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.800]   It does not cause people to start eating again
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.080]   and that actually makes sense
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.880]   because leptin is also a way
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.300]   of shutting off the hunger signals saying,
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.640]   it's the body fat's way of saying,
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.880]   hey, there's a lot of body fat here
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.120]   or there's sufficient body fat.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.120]   There doesn't even have to be a lot,
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.340]   but it has in some cases been shown to rescue
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.260]   the menstrual cycling in some anorexics.
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.760]   Okay, so body fat is signaling to the brain.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.300]   The gut is signaling to the brain.
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:07.760]   There are neurons in your gut
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.780]   that are primarily responding to,
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.360]   meaning they fire electrical signals
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.440]   when there are sufficient fatty acids
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.640]   coming from fats you ingest,
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.960]   amino acids coming from proteins you ingest
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.920]   and sugars coming from carbohydrates and sugars,
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.920]   things like fructose, glucose, et cetera.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:27.400]   Those signals are being sent from the fat
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.160]   and from the gut up to the brain
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:34.340]   and therefore your body has multiple signals
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.480]   of directing you toward eating more or eating less.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.080]   So you've got two categories of neurons,
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.840]   one that acts as an accelerator,
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:44.340]   the AGRP neuron saying, eat, eat,
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.820]   and gets you excited to eat.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.500]   And then you have a category of neurons,
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.840]   the PMOC neurons that are suppressing hunger.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:52.960]   They're acting like a break
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.800]   and the body is informing the brain all the time
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.200]   about the status of the body
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.780]   and whether or not it needs more food or not.
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.400]   So you might ask, why is it that people who are overweight
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.960]   and have a lot of body fat,
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.700]   why they would continue to eat a lot?
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.040]   Well, past a certain threshold of body fat,
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:08.860]   that's when you start getting
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.880]   into these so-called metabolic disorders
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.360]   where blood glucose metabolism is disrupted,
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.200]   leptin signaling is disrupted,
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.580]   and there are all sorts of changes
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.640]   on both the brain side and the body end of things
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.160]   such that they're hungry despite the fact
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:26.200]   that the body has plenty of energy on reserve.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:30.080]   Okay, that I think is sufficient to explain
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.360]   the basics of hunger and satiety
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.940]   and a kind of a biological mechanism.
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.380]   And the important thing again to remember
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:37.660]   is that they're mechanical and chemical signals
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.000]   that come from fullness or absence of fullness.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.880]   They come from the presence of glucose in the blood
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.920]   or the absence of glucose in the blood.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.360]   When you haven't eaten for a long time,
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:49.620]   glucagon levels go up, for instance, GLP-1 levels go up,
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:52.160]   and those will drive you to seek out food and want food.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.400]   And then there are these signals
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.000]   that are coming from body fat and from neurons in the gut.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.760]   So there's a lot of convergence signal, lot of pathways.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.080]   I don't offer you all those pathways to confuse you.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:05.360]   I offer you those pathways to clarify the extent
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.200]   to which something as simple as eating
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.540]   or the decision to not eat is complicated.
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:14.400]   We've perhaps heard, or I've certainly heard that,
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.560]   oh, you know, it takes about 20 minutes
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:19.500]   for satiety to set in, you know, so you should eat slowly,
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.840]   that you won't realize that you're full
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.480]   until about 20 minutes.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.800]   That's actually not true.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.920]   I don't know where that got started,
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.860]   but we should probably all chew our food better
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:28.240]   and eat more slowly,
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.780]   be more mindful of what we're eating, et cetera.
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.200]   So in anticipation of this episode,
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.080]   I consulted extensively with a colleague of mine at Stanford
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:40.600]   who sadly for us is going off to University of Pennsylvania.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:44.160]   So our loss is University of Pennsylvania's win.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.120]   His name is Dr. Casey Halpern.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:49.800]   He's a MD, medical doctor and neurosurgeon,
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.260]   and a PhD who studies binge eating disorder
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.100]   and other types of eating disorders
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.800]   and how they arise in the brain.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.600]   And he's developed some really pioneering treatments
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.080]   for them.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.260]   We'll talk more about his work
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.080]   a little bit later in the episode,
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:08.000]   but we got to the discussion of why a body
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.020]   that has sufficient energy levels
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.820]   would desire to eat more at all.
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:15.360]   And this is not just the case for binge eating disorder
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.740]   or for bulimia, but why that would be the case.
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.520]   You know, this is primitive biology
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.180]   that evolved over many tens,
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.540]   if not hundreds of thousands of years,
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:24.300]   you see it in mice, you see it in humans,
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:27.340]   very similar types of pathways and effects.
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:31.180]   How is it that human beings who have plenty of fat
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:34.700]   on reserve and plenty of glycogen in their liver, et cetera,
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.240]   in other words, plenty of energy,
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.240]   why they would be hungry, why they would eat at all.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.940]   It seems like that just shouldn't happen.
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:46.420]   And he had a very important and I think clear
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:49.700]   and intuitive way of framing up all this stuff
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.460]   around eating and motivated behaviors
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:53.220]   and how they can go awry,
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:55.580]   not just in eating disorders, but in all of us.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:01.880]   Basically what he said was from an evolutionary standpoint,
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:06.640]   it makes sense that we should eat as often as we can,
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.280]   as much as we can, and as fast as we can.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:11.520]   Well, that sounds crazy.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:16.340]   I was told to eat not too often, not too much,
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.780]   and to eat slowly and chew my food.
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.960]   But as Dr. Halperin pointed out,
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.600]   there are circuits in the brain to reward eating often,
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:29.380]   eating fast and cramming as much food into you as possible,
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:32.180]   because from a purely evolutionary standpoint,
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:36.460]   food was scarce and seeking food was dangerous,
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.940]   whether or not it was from animal sources or not.
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:41.840]   And it's always been competitive.
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.180]   For those of you that grew up in families
[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:45.460]   with a lot of siblings, this may resonate with you.
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.340]   I had just one sibling.
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:48.680]   We were competitive about certain things,
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:50.420]   but typically not competitive about food.
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:52.740]   But I had friends that had a lot of siblings.
[00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:55.580]   It was really interesting to see how food was served up
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:59.960]   and how it was taken in those households.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.200]   It was like food would hit the table
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:05.520]   and it was just an absolute war for portions.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.480]   And who got what and how much
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.080]   and who got a slightly bigger piece of cake, et cetera,
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:14.000]   turned out to be a frequent happening in these meals
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.580]   and at these birthday parties.
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.740]   Whereas the only children perhaps
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:20.300]   were used to having more food presented to them
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.000]   without having to compete with other members of the species.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.340]   Every animal, including humans,
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:28.700]   has a hardwired circuit that we were born with
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:32.140]   that pays attention to how much food is available,
[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:33.480]   how much we are getting now
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.280]   and how much we are likely to get in the future.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.460]   And without going down the rabbit hole
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:43.460]   of arcuate nucleus biology, in two sentences,
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:46.980]   you have a hypothalamic area called the arcuate nucleus.
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:48.260]   It's a fascinating area.
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:51.380]   It's actually the area that houses these PMOC neurons
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:52.440]   and these other types of neurons
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.220]   that regulate hunger and satiety.
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:58.240]   And these neurons in the arcuate nucleus
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:02.240]   start getting active when we see food and think about food.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:05.920]   They drive hunger and they drive hunger
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.940]   in a way that's responsive to what the food looks like,
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:10.460]   what it smells like,
[00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:14.100]   but also our prior history of interactions with that food.
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:17.300]   And it takes into account social context,
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:20.060]   whether or not we are going to get the whole pizza
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:23.220]   to ourselves or whether or not there are going to be others
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:24.720]   that we are going to have to compete with.
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:27.380]   So there are a lot of signals that this arcuate nucleus
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:29.580]   in your brain are paying attention to.
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.440]   So Dr. Halpern pointed out
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.940]   that you actually have an accelerator
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:36.940]   that increases your level of awareness and anxiety
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:39.340]   and sort of constricts your field of view
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:42.140]   and all your senses anytime you interact with food
[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:44.180]   and is driving a primitive reflex
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:48.100]   to ingest as much food as you can as quickly as you can,
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.660]   and then move on from there
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:52.120]   and presumably to do the same elsewhere.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:56.380]   So that changed the way that I think about eating behavior
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.180]   and eating disorders.
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.520]   In fact, we could think about eating disorders like bulimia
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.760]   as an unmasking of that mechanism
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.540]   without the so-called top-down control,
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:09.180]   without the mechanisms that we use to regulate our behavior.
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:12.420]   And indeed, bulimia and binge eating disorder
[00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:15.740]   are closely associated with impulsivity
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:18.780]   and with impulsive behaviors of other kinds,
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.780]   something that we also will discuss more.
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:22.680]   What's the pathway?
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.520]   How does this work?
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.260]   What is Dr. Halpern and his colleagues doing
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.900]   in order to try and treat things like binge eating disorder?
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:33.900]   Well, you can frame all of behavior,
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.920]   good decision-making and bad decision-making,
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.780]   in a pretty simple box diagram model.
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.720]   And I realized that many of you are listening to this,
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:42.720]   not watching this.
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.100]   There is no diagram to look at.
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.040]   I'll just explain it
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.380]   so that you can conceptualize it in your mind.
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:52.560]   We have knowledge of what we should do in one box, okay?
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:53.480]   We should eat that.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.440]   We shouldn't eat that.
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.360]   We should wait for dinner.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.500]   We shouldn't wait for dinner.
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:02.020]   And then we have what we actually do in another box, okay?
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:03.540]   Now, this is true for all behaviors.
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:06.080]   We should say something or we want to say something,
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:06.960]   but we don't.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.000]   We shouldn't say something, but we do anyway.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.960]   That's the knowledge, the kind of looping in your head.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.080]   I should do my homework.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.400]   I should go for a run.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.840]   I shouldn't do this right now.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.500]   I shouldn't be on social media.
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.280]   All those kinds of shoulds and shouldn'ts
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.460]   that are circulating in your head, that's one box.
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:23.720]   Then there's what you actually do, the behavior,
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.520]   whether or not you suppress the behavior,
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:27.800]   you turn off your phone and you go read a book
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.480]   or you go to sleep or whether or not you stay up all night
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.500]   or you stay up for another hour, even five minutes.
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:37.080]   In between those two boxes are two intervening forces.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.940]   And those intervening forces are critically important.
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:43.300]   Those intervening forces are homeostatic processes
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:46.760]   called by some processes, same thing.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:51.700]   Homeostatic processes that regulate the balance
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:54.200]   of different systems in your body, hot and cold,
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:58.760]   awake or asleep, dopamine and the desire to pursue things,
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:02.260]   serotonin and the desire to just relax and chill.
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:06.780]   So homeostatic processes and reward systems.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:08.800]   And as we now move into discussion
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.620]   about anorexia and bulimia specifically,
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:15.900]   what you'll see is that anorexia and bulimia
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.840]   are not a breaking of the mindset
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:21.920]   of what one should do or shouldn't do.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:26.280]   It's a disruption of these homeostatic and reward processes
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:29.160]   such that decision-making is completely disrupted
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.200]   and in many cases is not available
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.080]   to the anorexic or bulimic.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:34.480]   Now, I don't want to be abstract here.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:38.780]   What I'm saying is that the person who starves themselves
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:40.320]   to the point where they might die
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:42.860]   and in some cases sadly do die,
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:46.060]   they can know perfectly well that their behavior
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:50.500]   is leading to bad outcomes and possibly even death.
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:53.580]   And yet they are not able to intervene
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.900]   unless they get particular clinical help
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:59.800]   because the homeostatic processes,
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:03.500]   the signals from the body and brain that say you need food,
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.880]   those aren't registering in the same way
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:08.120]   that they are for other individuals.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:10.400]   And for the bulimic or the person that suffers
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.080]   from binge eating disorder,
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:14.880]   they don't necessarily want to eat that food.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.320]   They simply cannot help it.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.880]   It's like a reflex for them
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:22.060]   because the homeostatic processes
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:24.700]   and the reward processes associated with food
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:26.840]   are such that they can't intervene
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:30.020]   between the should do X, Y, or Z,
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:33.060]   or shouldn't do X, Y, or Z and what their actual behavior is.
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:37.160]   Now, this isn't just a biological mechanistic explanation
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.620]   for what could have been summarized in two sentences.
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:42.280]   What this is is a roadmap
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:45.360]   of where interventions can really make a difference.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:48.360]   So as we talk about different drug-based interventions
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:51.760]   or behavioral interventions or social interventions,
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.720]   I'd like you to think about whether or not
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:58.320]   those interventions are breaking into
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:01.040]   or tapping into this box of the thinking,
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.620]   the sort of pattern of thinking around food,
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:04.660]   whether or not it's the behavior,
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:07.280]   the actual ingestion or the restriction of food,
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.940]   or whether or not it's tapping into the homeostatic process,
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:11.560]   the balance of energy systems
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:14.100]   and kind of getting enough but not too much,
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:16.920]   or it's tapping into the reward system.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.040]   And just as a little teaser of where we're headed,
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.360]   what you'll find based on the data,
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.840]   clinical data experiments done very carefully
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.020]   and very well by excellent groups,
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:29.460]   what you'll find is that anorexics
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:32.740]   have a sort of switch that's been flipped
[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:34.400]   such that their decision-making
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.120]   is actually pretty darn good.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:37.760]   It might even be better than yours
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.980]   in terms of evaluating food nutritional content,
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:43.200]   but their habits are disrupted.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.660]   So they're not even consciously aware of the fact
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:46.980]   that they're making terrible
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:49.540]   and in some cases very dangerous food choices.
[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:52.800]   It turns out that habits
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:56.760]   and the way that we build and break and rebuild new habits
[00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:59.520]   is one of the most effective treatments for anorexia.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.060]   So now let's talk about anorexia,
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:03.200]   this failure to consume enough energy
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.200]   such that the individual is at risk of death.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.080]   And if not death, then severe metabolic disorders,
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.420]   lack of bone density, et cetera.
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.600]   As I mentioned earlier,
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.780]   anorexia and things that almost certainly were
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.260]   and are anorexia have been described
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:22.220]   as early as the 1600s and maybe even earlier.
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:24.280]   There are some records from the saints,
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:28.180]   from the 1400s of people that refuse to ingest food.
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:32.120]   Another common myth is that anorexia
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:37.120]   is only the sort of thing that you see in rich societies.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.980]   These are spoiled children with so much food
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:42.620]   that they decide they're only going to focus on
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:46.080]   how slim they are, how they look in bathing suits, et cetera.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.320]   Not true.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:50.560]   A careful analysis through medical epidemiology
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.620]   has shown that you find anorexia
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:56.240]   even in cultures and societies where food is scarce.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.700]   So that really speaks to biological mechanism.
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.200]   Now it's hard to unveil in societies where food is scarce
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.340]   because a lot of people are starving and hungry,
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:09.720]   but there are individuals that choose still to avoid food
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:12.440]   and seem to have some sort of reward mechanism
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.580]   that rewards them or makes them feel better
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:17.960]   if they don't eat despite the fact
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.000]   that their body is severely depleted of nutrients.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.820]   So that's very interesting and points again
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:26.540]   to some disruption in some biological mechanism.
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:29.620]   Now, I want to make sure that I'm emphasizing
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.520]   that I'm not in favor of people,
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.460]   in particular young children,
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:36.320]   adolescents and teenagers being bombarded
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.040]   with unrealistic imagery about bodies.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.720]   But the idea that that's the cause of,
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.080]   or is amplifying anorexia,
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.800]   the data just don't seem to support that.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.740]   Anorexia in its classic sense
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:52.600]   requires that there be an endocrine,
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.880]   meaning a hormonal disruption,
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.360]   menstrual abnormalities,
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.900]   lack of sperm production or low testosterone in males
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:03.520]   in order to meet the classification for anorexia.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.560]   But as I mentioned earlier,
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:09.280]   there are now nuanced and new classifications of anorexia
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.740]   that even for individuals that still menstruate
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:14.300]   or that maintain sperm production,
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:16.660]   that anorexia can still be considered
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:19.240]   a clinically diagnosable disorder.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:22.580]   Now, typically anorexia starts in adolescents
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:23.600]   right around puberty.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.400]   Let's take a look at what puberty is.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.320]   Puberty at a very broad level
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.940]   is the most significant and dramatic developmental step
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.840]   anyone goes through in their lifespan.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.320]   The body changes, the brain changes,
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:39.360]   perceptions change, one's own self perception changes.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.500]   And most of those changes are driven by changes
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.080]   in circuitry within the hypothalamus.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.980]   So neurons that are controlling the production
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.520]   of the so-called sex steroid hormones,
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.060]   things like testosterone, estrogen and related hormones,
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.400]   prolactin, et cetera,
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.360]   those are all changing at very rapid rates.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:00.060]   Anorexia tends to show up around this time
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:03.840]   in a subset of individuals who on the face of it
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:06.080]   seem to find food aversive.
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.240]   Now, the purely psychological theory of this
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.520]   is that they are fighting for autonomy.
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.800]   They want control.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.520]   Puberty is also a time in which children and parents
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.200]   are in a tug of war over control.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.100]   You were once a small child
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.400]   being told when to go to bed, sent to your room.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.820]   Now you're a child that can talk back and say,
[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:26.180]   I don't want to, or I refuse to.
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:29.160]   And that happens a lot in various households
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.860]   as I'm sure you're familiar with.
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:34.180]   Adolescence and puberty is also
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:37.460]   when girls start menstruating typically
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:41.860]   or boys develop deeper voice,
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:44.420]   they start producing sperm, et cetera.
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.760]   So there are a lot of bodily changes
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.480]   that also drive perceptual changes
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.520]   and perceptual changes that drive bodily changes.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:54.520]   And it is a dramatic shift for a young girl or boy
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.720]   that doesn't nourish themselves sufficiently
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.560]   during that period.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.360]   There are a number of downstream negative effects.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.580]   I'll list out some of them.
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:04.280]   These are just a subset of the effects.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.820]   Hypogonadism, that's the lack of sperm production
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:10.060]   or healthy egg production.
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:15.060]   There is amenorrhea, which is the lack of menstrual cycling.
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.660]   So a failure to have a menstrual cycle.
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:18.980]   Reduced insulin secretion.
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.900]   Insulin is this hormone that's released
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.320]   in order to help shuttle glucose
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.620]   into various tissues for energy utilization.
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:28.300]   That's down because energy levels are down so much.
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.180]   One of the symptoms that's a little more cryptic
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:32.460]   and that has actually interesting implications
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.860]   for sake of the cholesterol hypothesis
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:39.860]   is that anorexics who ingest very little food
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:42.860]   often have cosmically high levels of cholesterol,
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:45.980]   including LDL, low density lipoprotein cholesterol.
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:47.460]   You say, well, how could that possibly be it?
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:50.780]   We were all told and continue to be told from many sources
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:53.460]   that ingestion of dietary cholesterol
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.900]   is what drives high levels of bodily cholesterol.
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.120]   Cholesterol is manufactured by the liver.
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:02.920]   And in anorexics who consume very little food,
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.100]   they often have cosmically high levels of cholesterol,
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.520]   which is one of the kind of wrinkles
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:11.540]   in the so-called dietary cholesterol hypothesis
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.580]   that all of our cholesterol that we see on a blood panel
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:16.360]   is due to what we eat.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.580]   But the explanation for it is that under conditions
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.220]   where there's not sufficient cholesterol
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.360]   to synthesize the sex steroid hormones,
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.960]   things like testosterone and estrogen,
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.100]   which are required in both males and females,
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:29.860]   those are made from cholesterol,
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.820]   that the body, the liver will start generating
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:36.120]   its own cholesterol and will often overshoot the mark
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.520]   to a dramatic degree.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.820]   So the blood lipid profiles in anorexics
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:41.540]   are often very unhealthy,
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:44.820]   despite the fact that they're eating very little food.
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.980]   In addition, they tend to have elevated levels
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.560]   of things like vasopressin,
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.860]   which are hormones that regulate body temperature
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:54.140]   and salt and blood volume.
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.380]   They tend to have low blood pressure.
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:56.340]   They can pass out.
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.640]   I mentioned some of the other symptoms earlier.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.740]   In other words, there are a huge number
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.060]   of terrible things happening.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:06.180]   Thyroid levels are down, heart rates are down.
[01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:07.980]   If I'm painting a very bleak picture here,
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:10.220]   it is indeed a bleak picture.
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:13.260]   So we have to ask ourselves what can be done
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.040]   for the anorexic, right?
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.260]   Let's say it's a failure of the AGRP neurons
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:21.940]   to stimulate appetite and feeding.
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:24.180]   Let's say it's too much anxiety around food.
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:27.180]   Let's say it's because of the way that food restriction
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:29.320]   was used for reward in the household, right?
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.160]   I'm making this up,
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.820]   but you can imagine a hypothetical scenario
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:35.200]   where let's just say the mother
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.660]   of a particular individual is very vocal
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.080]   about her avoidance of food.
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.260]   We've seen this before, right?
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:42.280]   You've probably seen somebody who loves to cook
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.700]   and prepare food, but then sits down
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:44.540]   and doesn't seem to eat.
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:47.320]   And they always seem to in air quotes have eaten earlier.
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:49.900]   I ate while I cooked, I ate while I cooked, right?
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:52.800]   These people that you never actually see eating.
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:53.740]   We all know people like this.
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:54.640]   Are they anorexic?
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.000]   Possibly, we don't know.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.940]   A child observes that kind of behavior.
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:01.180]   Maybe that individual is being always being told
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:04.160]   how beautiful they look or how wonderful or fit they look,
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.560]   what incredible meals they produce.
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:11.560]   And you could imagine a purely psychosocial set of events
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:14.920]   that could lead a child to be anorexic.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.900]   That doesn't seem to be the case,
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:20.360]   at least not in terms of driving classic anorexia
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:25.180]   of really extreme deprivation of oneself from food.
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:28.760]   However, there's a strong genetic component for anorexia.
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.760]   So you could imagine a mild form of anorexia in a parent
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:37.680]   that is supported or exacerbated by praise
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.140]   so that the person feels good
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:40.760]   from the praise they're getting,
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:44.440]   that they want to be a low body weight for whatever reason,
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.800]   for aesthetic reasons or for whatever reasons
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.440]   that happen to appeal to them.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:52.400]   And the child has a genetic predisposition, right?
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.300]   We never think about genes in terms of controlling behavior,
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:59.320]   genes bias probabilities for behavior, okay?
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.740]   So you can have a gene for depression or for schizophrenia,
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:04.240]   but it's not deterministic in the same way
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.800]   that there are genes that determine your eye color
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.280]   or your skin color or your hair color, okay?
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.020]   So there's a genetic predisposition there.
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.220]   And that genetic predisposition could exist
[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:18.680]   such that if one is rewarded enough times
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.340]   for a particular behavior,
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:24.020]   that behavior can start to ratchet in
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:25.220]   to our neural circuitry
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.080]   because behavior drives neural changes,
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.360]   so-called neuroplasticity.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.840]   And you could imagine that that child
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.200]   could develop a full-blown case of anorexia.
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.060]   And this is why I raised at the beginning
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:38.240]   that no one really knows how to define healthy eating.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.860]   And so therefore we have to rely
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:43.880]   on just identification of unhealthy behaviors.
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.100]   But what do we point people to
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:48.700]   in terms of what healthy replacement behaviors would be?
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:51.360]   So rather than just look at anorexics and say,
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.400]   they're not eating enough,
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.680]   and there's this huge array of terrible things
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.240]   that they're doing to their body and they need to eat more,
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:59.680]   we need to rescue them from themselves.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.920]   Let's look under the hood.
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.440]   Let's look at what's known about the neural circuitry
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.760]   and the sorts of perceptions and behaviors
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.760]   of the neural circuitry is driving
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:11.760]   in order to understand what they are truly suffering from
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.160]   at the level of cause, not just symptoms.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.440]   It's clear what they're suffering from
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.040]   at the level of symptoms.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.240]   Symptoms are how we diagnose.
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.720]   I listed off a number of those things.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.640]   But let's look under the hood and try and identify
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:27.400]   where one could intervene in theory
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:31.280]   in order to try and rescue the anorexic
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.400]   or help the anorexic rescue themselves.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:37.560]   Because it turns out that the answer,
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.620]   or at least one of the answers of how to do that
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:41.200]   is not intuitive at all.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.480]   At least to me was very surprising.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:46.080]   I would be remiss if I didn't start with the obvious,
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.000]   which is, is there a chemical defect?
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.200]   Meaning, is there some disruption
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.880]   in one of the major chemical systems in the brain
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.240]   that makes anorexics anorexic?
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:59.820]   And therefore, can we replace that chemical
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.300]   or can we reduce some chemical
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:04.100]   and essentially eliminate anorexia?
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:07.640]   And the answer is not really sort of, maybe no.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.100]   Here's why.
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.240]   There are a lot of different chemicals in the brain and body,
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:16.060]   but there are a category of chemicals
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:17.520]   that are particularly important
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.300]   that if you've listened to this podcast before,
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.800]   even if you haven't,
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.400]   are going to come up again and again and again.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.840]   And that is the category of chemicals in the brain and body
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.720]   called the neuromodulators.
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:30.520]   Neuromodulators are different than neurotransmitters
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.480]   in the sense that neuromodulators modulate
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:35.480]   or change the activity of brain areas and neural circuits.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.760]   You can think of them as microphones
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:40.800]   that are held between particular sets of connections
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.960]   in the brain that make those connections in the brain
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:46.800]   more likely to be active relative to others, okay?
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.880]   They make them louder, so to speak.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.160]   There are many neuromodulators,
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.280]   but the ones that are important
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.340]   for sake of today's discussion are the classic ones.
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:58.980]   Dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:00.280]   Let's focus on serotonin.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.120]   Serotonin is a neuromodulator
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.820]   that tends to increase the activity
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.540]   of certain neural circuits,
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:11.560]   including within the hypothalamus, but also within the body,
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:16.240]   that trigger a sense of satiety of having enough,
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:21.040]   enough food, enough warmth, enough social connection,
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:26.040]   enough of any motivated goal or drive or any type of thing
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:29.460]   or behavior that one would want more of,
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:33.660]   serotonin tends to make those circuits quiet down.
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:37.380]   Now, there are many categories of drugs
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.560]   that emphasize the serotonergic circuitry,
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.660]   meaning they cause the release of
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:45.320]   or the efficiency of serotonin in the brain and body,
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.880]   things like Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, things of that variety.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.200]   Those drugs have been used to some degree of success,
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.440]   although not much, to treat things like anorexia nervosa.
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.960]   That should make sense
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.820]   because if these drugs increase serotonin,
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.380]   if their general effect is to increase serotonin,
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:08.740]   it will be to lower anxiety.
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:10.200]   That sounds like a great thing.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.280]   A lot of anorexics are really anxious around food.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.060]   We'll talk about why.
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.560]   Lowering anxiety, you might think,
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.640]   would lead to ingestion of more food,
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.000]   but that's not often what happens.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.320]   Increasing serotonin by way of some drug regimen
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.640]   will tend to make one less hungry
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:31.320]   because with heightened levels of serotonin
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.360]   in the blood and brain,
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.780]   there isn't the desire to go seek out the things
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:37.760]   that will raise serotonin on their own.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.040]   Now, some anorexics do well
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:43.440]   or benefit from these serotonergic drugs,
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.760]   these drugs that increase the activity of these circuits
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.140]   that lead to satiety.
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:49.280]   But if you think about the major goal
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.820]   of treating an anorexic,
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:55.600]   it's to get them to have more hunger, more appetite.
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.320]   So now I want to focus on some of the work
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.380]   that's been done around the habits
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.240]   and behaviors of anorexics,
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.360]   because those turned out to be ideal places
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:05.320]   for intervention.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:09.000]   The work I'm about to describe
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.860]   was done by Dr. Joanna Steinglass and colleagues
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:13.780]   at Columbia University in New York.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.200]   And there are other groups as well.
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.880]   Of course, they're doing this type of work,
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.220]   but they did what I think are really
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.780]   some beautiful experiments
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:23.160]   and some beautiful explorations
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.000]   of potential treatments for anorexics
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.840]   that seem to have a quite high degree of effectiveness
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.280]   when they are applied correctly.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.220]   First of all, there's a challenge in studying anorexia
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:38.360]   because in anorexia, what you're essentially studying
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.360]   is the absence of a behavior.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:43.280]   It's very hard to study the absence of a behavior
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.460]   as opposed to a behavior.
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:47.580]   So they did some experiments with anorexics,
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:51.480]   giving them a gallery of pictures of different foods
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.080]   and allowing those anorexic patients
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.320]   to arrange those foods according to preference
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.000]   about what they would select,
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.080]   about food nutrient content, about caloric content.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:07.100]   They essentially asked these anorexics to evaluate food.
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.520]   And in doing so, they were able to identify
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.140]   something that's very unique to anorexics
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:15.260]   at the level of their perception of food.
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:17.800]   What they found is that anorexics,
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.360]   rather than being anxious in the presence of food
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:23.520]   and that anxiety driving an avoidance of food,
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:27.020]   what they found is that anorexics have a hyper acuity,
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:30.280]   a hyper awareness of the fat content of foods,
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.840]   almost to the point of being sort of fat content savants.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.800]   Now, they don't necessarily know that they're doing this.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.480]   They're not looking at an avocado and thinking,
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.600]   "Okay, that's X number of grams of fat," rather,
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.440]   or looking at an apple and saying, "Okay, that has no fat."
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.080]   They start to do this more or less reflexively.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.860]   Now, it's a well-known symptom of anorexia,
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:51.820]   especially young anorexics,
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:54.960]   that they have kind of an obsession with food,
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.320]   caloric contents, macronutrient ratios,
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:00.900]   meaning fat, protein, and carbohydrate ratios.
[01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:02.620]   They know caloric numbers,
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:04.760]   but then they sort of pass that information
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:07.280]   into a memory system in their brain
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.140]   that allows their interactions with food
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:11.920]   to be very reflexive in a way
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.400]   that they are actively avoiding high fat content foods,
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.720]   calorie rich foods,
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.800]   and defaulting towards very low calorie foods
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.980]   if they have to eat.
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.640]   Now, this might seem like an almost trivial result
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:26.480]   on the face of it.
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.580]   You think, "Okay, they don't like to eat.
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.800]   When they do eat, they eat low calorie, low fat foods, duh."
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.960]   But it's the way in which they are doing this subconsciously
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.380]   that they learn this information
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:39.200]   and then they pass it off to a reflexive habit.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.680]   And that's very important
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.280]   because what that means is that we need to look at
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.740]   what processes in the brain, what brain areas,
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:49.920]   what chemicals drive decision-making and knowledge.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.280]   And we also need to look at the areas of the brain
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:57.280]   that drive habit formation and habit execution.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.640]   Because for any of you that have habits,
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.400]   and that means all of you,
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:04.400]   the hallmark feature of a habit is that it's reflexive.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.420]   You have a mosquito bite on your leg, you scratch it.
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:07.760]   You didn't necessarily even think,
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.560]   "Oh, I'm going to scratch that."
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:13.080]   In fact, just to take a little bit of a moment of respite
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:15.760]   and talk about habits in general,
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.320]   there's a beautiful study that was done
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.960]   out of Caltech University,
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.040]   looking at the parking lot of where people park
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.780]   in the morning without designated parking spots
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:27.400]   and the trajectories that they use
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.080]   to walk to their offices in the morning.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.860]   So they put cameras up on the roof of Caltech.
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:33.260]   This is the kind of thing that the nerdy kids at Caltech do.
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:35.280]   I think at Caltech, if you call someone a nerd,
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.120]   I think it's a compliment.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.360]   So my apologies to the non-nerds at Caltech.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.800]   I think there's one or two of you.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:43.720]   And for the nerdy ones of you at Caltech, you're welcome.
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:46.080]   They videotaped the behaviors of these faculty
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.280]   and students and staff.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:51.000]   And what they found is that people follow trajectories
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.680]   from their car that are remarkably stereotyped.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:56.720]   First of all, they tend to park always in the same spot
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:57.880]   if they can.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.280]   They tend to get out of their car, of course,
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.200]   'cause they're on the driver's side
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:02.040]   or passenger side in the same place.
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.920]   They turn and pivot their body
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.580]   at approximately the same rate every day.
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:08.500]   They close the door, they put their bag on their shoulder
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.520]   or across their chest or however it is that they carry,
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.900]   their briefcase or whatever it is.
[01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:15.100]   And they follow trajectories onto campus
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:17.540]   that are so stereotyped that you'd wonder
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:19.500]   if you just trace line after line after line,
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:23.680]   what you'd find is that every day is almost exactly the same
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:24.900]   and you do this too.
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:27.900]   You don't realize it because if you're being videotaped
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.080]   when this kind of behavior, it's not being released to you,
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:33.160]   but your behaviors are so stereotyped to the point
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:35.400]   where if you were to see them laid out in front of you
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.060]   in kind of diagrammatic format of the lines
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:40.380]   and the trajectories that you follow throughout the day,
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:41.600]   the lifting of your mug
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.600]   and how frequently you drink each hour,
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:47.760]   you would be amazed and probably a little bit scared
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.280]   by how much of a robot we all are.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.680]   Now, that robotic aspect of our neural circuitry is vital
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:56.960]   because it's what allows us to think about other things
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.800]   and do other things and drive other behaviors.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:03.040]   But the work of Dr. Steinglass and colleagues showed
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:05.260]   that in the case of the anorexic,
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:07.960]   those habits are exactly the place
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.960]   where things start to go awry
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.700]   and that drive this very dysfunctional under eating behavior
[01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:16.120]   that sadly often leads to death
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:18.560]   or certainly bad medical outcomes.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.620]   And it turns out that the brain areas associated
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:24.240]   with habit formation and execution
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.600]   are the best point of intervention.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.880]   So what Dr. Steinglass and colleagues did
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.960]   is they took anorexics and they of course had control groups
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:36.180]   and they put them in an fMRI scanner,
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:39.020]   which are these brain scanners that allow you to evaluate
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:42.400]   which brain areas are active during particular tasks.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.240]   And because when you're in one of those scanners,
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:47.180]   you're actually, I've actually been in one of these things,
[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:50.440]   you're biting down on a bite bar and you're most of the time
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:52.520]   in most all of these scanners, you're immobile.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.100]   So you're looking at things on a TV screen.
[01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:56.940]   Sometimes you can press buttons to select choices
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:00.640]   and so forth, but you can't really eat within those things.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:05.640]   What they found was that reward-based decision-making,
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.880]   the drive to pursue a particular food
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:12.440]   or the drive to perform a particular task,
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:15.200]   which is a lot of what we do throughout our day,
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.560]   that was controlled by a brain area
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:19.160]   called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.780]   Let me simplify a little bit of this,
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:23.480]   but I'm going to simplify it by giving you a little detail
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.000]   because it's the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.260]   And I believe in mechanism.
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:29.660]   Mechanism is the way that you get true understanding
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:32.920]   and that you can then be very quick
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.220]   and give overviews of things, but you need the mechanism.
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:41.220]   So you have reflexes and you have neural processes
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:45.920]   that include what are called duration path
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.740]   and outcome type processes.
[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:49.860]   A duration path outcome type process,
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:52.100]   we can shorten with DPO.
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:57.100]   DPO is for all types of goal-related behaviors.
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.060]   So for instance, if you want to get a particular grade
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.500]   on an exam, you want to learn something,
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:02.560]   you want to complete a workout,
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:05.240]   you want to go to the grocery store and pick some stuff up
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:08.260]   and then head home, you're going to think duration.
[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:09.180]   How long do I have?
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:11.140]   Okay, do I have 45 minutes to get to the store?
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.560]   How long does it take to get to the store?
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.460]   Path, which way am I going to drive there?
[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:17.020]   Which way am I going to navigate through the grocery store?
[01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:19.420]   Outcome, was I able to get in and get the items I need
[01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:20.540]   and get home in time?
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:22.620]   Okay, DPO, duration path outcome.
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:24.680]   It's a very conscious process.
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:27.020]   You tend to take into account different criteria
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.600]   related to what's in,
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:31.280]   what's preventing you from accomplishing what you want to do
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.420]   and what's helping you or assisting you.
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:35.900]   So of course, as you get to the checkout line
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:36.740]   in the grocery store,
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:38.160]   you're going to select the shortest line, for instance.
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:39.380]   So that's all DPO stuff.
[01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:42.740]   It requires decision-making and it's reward-based.
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:46.540]   You use these DPO type processes in the short term
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:50.200]   to pick up groceries and pick a line at the grocery store
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.140]   and decide which trajectory to take home.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:56.880]   And you use them for navigating long extended processes
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:59.060]   in life, trying to get a degree or raise children
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:03.660]   or get through a particularly challenging year, et cetera.
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:05.260]   So duration path outcome,
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:08.600]   and that entire process relies on your forebrain,
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.220]   this prefrontal cortex.
[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:13.840]   The prefrontal cortex is what allows you
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.500]   to take information from memory,
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:18.240]   combine it with information about what's happening
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.900]   in the present context,
[01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:24.220]   and then to direct your behavior, your speech, et cetera,
[01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:25.660]   toward particular outcomes.
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:29.240]   And if all that sounds like a mouthful, it is,
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:30.960]   and it's very metabolically demanding.
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.200]   Decision-making is metabolically demanding.
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.080]   It takes effort, okay?
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:39.060]   Reflexes, on the other hand,
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:41.520]   don't involve the prefrontal cortex in the same way.
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:44.660]   Habits and reflexes, like once you know how to walk,
[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:45.820]   you get up and you walk.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:47.520]   You don't have to think about right foot, left foot,
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:49.780]   right foot, left foot, you just do it.
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:51.800]   That doesn't rely on prefrontal cortex.
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.840]   It's subconscious as it's sometimes called,
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:56.840]   but basically you don't have to use the parts of the brain
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.360]   that are involved in duration path
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:01.200]   and outcome type analysis, okay?
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:03.320]   So in this particular study,
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:06.900]   they examined brain activity in anorexics
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:09.900]   who are selecting different foods.
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:10.900]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:13.540]   they have a hyperacuity or awareness
[01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:16.700]   of which foods contain more or less calories
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:19.080]   than other foods and what the fat content
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.480]   of particular foods is in particular, et cetera.
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:25.260]   They're doing all this while in a scanner,
[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:28.300]   and then they look at what sorts of brain areas
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:31.660]   are active after that task is done.
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:33.620]   And what they found was really interesting.
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:37.660]   What they found was that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:41.500]   not surprisingly, is involved in the decision-making
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:44.100]   and the evaluation of this food,
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:47.820]   which foods are going to be best to eat in this context,
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:50.300]   which foods are going to be appropriate
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:53.180]   for at least that anorexics framework
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:55.580]   about what's okay to eat and what's not okay to eat
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:56.800]   and how much.
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:00.420]   However, there are areas of the brain
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:03.660]   that were active after that decision-making process.
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:05.940]   And those are the brain areas that turn out
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:09.380]   to drive the habit of avoiding particular foods
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:11.460]   and approaching other foods.
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:12.300]   And in that case,
[01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:14.740]   it wasn't the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:18.220]   It was an area of the brain called the dorsolateral striatum.
[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:20.940]   Now, the striatum is a big area in the brain.
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:23.020]   It's involved in a lot of different things.
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:25.860]   It includes areas like the caudate and putatum.
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:27.780]   And I just want to mention, as I throw out all these names,
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.780]   you do not need to remember the names
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:30.820]   of these different structures.
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:32.220]   They're just there if you are interested
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:33.920]   in that level of detail.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.500]   But basically you have a brain area,
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.260]   and anorexics have a brain area that's involved
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:39.720]   in evaluating and decision-making around food.
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:42.120]   And then another brain area that's involved
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:45.900]   in the reflexive consumption of particular foods
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:48.980]   and the reflexive avoidance of other foods.
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:53.460]   If you remember way back at the beginning of the episode,
[01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:55.280]   I feel like that was a long time ago now,
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:58.540]   when we talked about how you have these sorts of processes
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:01.580]   in the brain, but there are always homeostatic
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:05.340]   and reward systems influencing this kind of thing.
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:08.860]   Well, in the brain of the anorexic,
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:12.720]   it turns out that the reward systems have been attached
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:14.860]   to the execution of habits
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:18.220]   in a way that is unhealthy for body weight,
[01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:21.600]   but at least from a purely neural circuit perspective,
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:25.540]   the reward is now given, this chemical reward in the brain,
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:28.580]   is given for avoiding particular foods
[01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:33.380]   and only approaching these very low calorie, low fat foods.
[01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:37.280]   So there really does seem to be a flip in the switch
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:40.460]   in the anorexic brain that rewards them internally.
[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:43.900]   They feel good when they avoid certain foods
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:45.340]   and they approach others.
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:47.820]   So it's not a deprivation-based model
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:51.660]   where they are flagellating themselves or masochistic
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:55.540]   or actively avoiding food in order to punish themselves,
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:57.660]   which is interesting 'cause a lot of psychological theories
[01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:59.080]   support that idea.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:04.080]   Rather, once this transitions into a set of habits,
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:06.420]   they are actually getting a sense of reward.
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:08.500]   They feel good, presumably from the release
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:12.180]   of a different neuromodulator called dopamine,
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:16.380]   by approaching foods that are low fat, low calorie content.
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:19.220]   And so their whole brain circuitry is skewed
[01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:21.020]   toward avoiding particular things
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:24.600]   and they actually are rewarded for that and they feel good.
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:26.760]   They feel better than if they were eating
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.900]   in a healthy weight-supporting way.
[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:33.420]   Now, the dorsolateral striatum is a structure
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:36.060]   that we should think about in a little bit more depth.
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:38.780]   It's part of a set of circuits that are involved
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:40.820]   in what are called go/no-go tasks.
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.460]   And I don't want to go into this in a lot of detail
[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:45.240]   right now because it would take us too far down
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.320]   the rabbit hole of neural circuitry.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:51.880]   But basically, in terms of behaviors,
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:55.340]   we both have DPO-type behaviors,
[01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:57.780]   so decision-making, reward-based behaviors,
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:02.160]   and we have habits that we learn and we acquire
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.460]   and then we just start to execute reflexively.
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:07.700]   Things like walking, things like yawning when we're tired,
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:11.120]   things like taking a particular route through the parking lot.
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:13.620]   We learn that the first time we go to a given parking lot
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:14.460]   and walk into a building,
[01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:16.620]   but after that we tend to follow the exact same trajectory.
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:18.820]   It becomes very automatized.
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:22.220]   It's just like we just do it without thinking.
[01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:27.220]   Well, the go/no-go circuitry is another aspect
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:30.640]   of our behavior where we both have to select behaviors
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.780]   to perform and we have to select behaviors to suppress.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:39.780]   And the anorexic brain seems to reward suppression
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:43.060]   of one set of behaviors, ingestion of high-calorie foods,
[01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:47.980]   and to reward focus or even hyper-focus
[01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:52.000]   and consumption of low-fat, low-calorie foods.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.560]   So this homeostatic process that we learn about
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.620]   from like high school onward that, oh,
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:58.140]   everything in your body is designed
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:26:59.680]   to keep everything in balance.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.240]   You stay awake for a certain amount of time,
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.220]   you want to sleep.
[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:03.140]   You don't eat for a while,
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.020]   then you want to eat to maintain weight, right?
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:07.100]   You eat too much, then you want to eat less.
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:09.380]   Those systems are disrupted.
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:12.320]   And so what's so beautiful about this work
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:17.260]   from the Columbia group is that what it says is
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:20.740]   the place to intervene has to be the habit.
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:23.260]   This stuff has already passed through all the learning.
[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:25.220]   It's passed through all the reward systems.
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:27.100]   It's clearly not being overrun
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:28.900]   by the homeostatic processes of the body.
[01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:30.400]   There's very little body fat.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.580]   There's no leptin.
[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.340]   Whatever neurons in the brain respond to leptin
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:35.540]   are starved for leptin.
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:37.360]   Periods have shut down, sperm production
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:40.240]   and testosterone is lowered, bone density is down.
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:44.340]   Clearly this is overriding all those homeostatic processes,
[01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:47.220]   all the signals that would say, eat, eat, eat.
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:50.860]   Those don't matter in the brain of the anorexic.
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:53.740]   The brain of the anorexic is just performing habits
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:55.500]   and they're being rewarded for it.
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:57.520]   So when you come along and say, look,
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.660]   you should really eat this whole pie or this whole pizza,
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:00.700]   you'll feel better.
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:02.540]   That's actually aversive to them.
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:04.540]   So since it appears to be a habit,
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:08.660]   a reflex that's perpetuating the anorexic phenotype,
[01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:09.560]   as we say in science,
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:12.460]   it's perpetuating anorexia in this individual
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:14.980]   and telling them about all this terrible stuff
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:17.160]   that's happening in their body won't work.
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:20.660]   Taking them away from all the images of thin people online,
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.580]   et cetera, that's not going to work.
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:24.000]   What's going to work?
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.340]   What's going to work is intervening in the neural circuitry
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:29.160]   that's related to the habit itself.
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:32.420]   And it turns out that there are ways to do that.
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:33.820]   So how do you break a habit?
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:35.600]   How do you rewire the brain circuitry
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.560]   that's literally causing a reflex?
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.400]   And in this case,
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:41.620]   causing a reflex that is killing the individual,
[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:44.700]   or at least leading to very bad health outcomes.
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:49.660]   The way that you do that is through a cognitive mechanism
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:51.500]   where you teach the individual
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:53.780]   what is leading up to the habit.
[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:55.260]   This is a little bit similar to the way
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:58.100]   that somebody who suffers from addiction
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:01.300]   starts to put in different constraint type behaviors.
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:04.100]   Constraint type behaviors are the sorts of things
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:07.220]   like where the alcoholic will call a hotel ahead of time
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:10.760]   and say, listen, I want the minibar taken out of the room.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.660]   I don't want a television in the room, et cetera,
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:14.140]   constraint type behaviors.
[01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:18.660]   Those are really ways of keeping oneself from the temptation.
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:19.980]   But with these habits,
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.300]   they work at such a subconscious level
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:25.740]   that what seems to work best is a combination
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:29.920]   of teaching the individual about their internal state
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:31.660]   and how to register their internal state,
[01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:32.860]   what we call interoception,
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:35.460]   this ability to perceive your internal state,
[01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:38.020]   so that they can start to learn
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:41.720]   to associate the interactions with different types of food
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:44.820]   with the sorts of cues that are occurring within their body,
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:46.700]   quickening of heart rate,
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:49.780]   hyperacuity of focus that we talked about earlier.
[01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:51.460]   Once they start to be able to notice
[01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:53.060]   that those things are happening,
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:54.980]   then they can start to intervene.
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:57.340]   So let's talk about what those things are
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:29:59.140]   that lead into a habit,
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:02.220]   because those turn out to be the exact points of entry
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:05.960]   for changing and eliminating and rewiring habits
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.500]   toward more healthy behaviors.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.940]   And I should highlight that this isn't just about
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:12.300]   rewiring habits for sake of the anorexic.
[01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.540]   These are also the same types of mechanisms
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:16.540]   that one would want to incorporate
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:19.380]   in order to rewire any habit of any kind.
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:21.480]   There are two main features of thinking
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:25.300]   that go into the sorts of habits that anorexics execute.
[01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:29.440]   The first is something called weak central coherence.
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:32.440]   Weak central coherence is essentially an inability
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.960]   to see the forest through the trees.
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:37.960]   It's a hyperacuity and focus on details
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:39.000]   within a given environment.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.620]   And there's actually an interesting probe test for anorexia
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:44.400]   that involves something akin
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:47.280]   to kind of a where's Waldo type puzzle,
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:50.100]   where an image is put up.
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:52.920]   The one that I saw was one in which there's a big array
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.060]   of coffee beans.
[01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:55.620]   Actually, they're all brown coffee beans.
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:58.660]   And your job is to identify
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:01.500]   where in that array of coffee beans there's a face.
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.660]   And indeed there's a face embedded in there.
[01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:04.940]   It looks a little bit like a coffee bean,
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:06.560]   but once you see it, you realize it's a face,
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.020]   not a coffee bean.
[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:11.920]   And it becomes very hard to not notice the face after that.
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:17.220]   Anorexics are very good at identifying the face.
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:21.160]   They find it much faster than do non-anorexics,
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:22.920]   which is really interesting, right?
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:25.240]   They somehow are able to hone in on details
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:28.960]   and find those details and fixate on those details.
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:32.320]   Now, eventually most, if not all people find the face.
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.040]   But once you do, what you will find
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.640]   and what everyone finds is that you can't unfind the face.
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:38.500]   It just jumps out.
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:40.520]   So what essentially you've lost is the ability
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:43.680]   to see the whole picture because there's some detail
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:46.160]   within that picture that you're obsessed by.
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:47.440]   So this has kind of elements
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.840]   of obsessive compulsive disorder,
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:52.160]   but it's not really obsessive compulsive disorder per se.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:54.600]   So we call that weak central coherence.
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:58.500]   It's a hyper acuity on one particular feature.
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.200]   You miss the big picture.
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.200]   The other is a challenge in set shifting
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:04.020]   that once you identify something
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:06.040]   that's of particular interest
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:09.840]   and that's driving some sort of reward for the anorexic,
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:12.240]   that would be identifying the high fat foods
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:14.280]   or identifying the one food on the table
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:17.200]   that one could eat without anyone hopefully noticing
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.640]   that they're eating just the green beans
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:21.400]   and not touching any of the other food.
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.640]   If you ever had a meal with an anorexic,
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:25.400]   you might be familiar with this.
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:27.840]   It's kind of uncomfortable to be around actually.
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:29.700]   They go through a lot of elaborate procedures
[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:32.760]   to kind of hide food, to they'll sometimes even chew food,
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.600]   hold it in their mouth and then go to the bathroom
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:35.440]   and discard it.
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.440]   Things very elaborate, very troubling types of things
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:38.960]   to hear about and to be around.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.320]   But you'll notice that they push food
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:41.400]   around their plate a lot.
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.280]   They become masterful actually
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.640]   at trying to keep people's awareness
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:46.720]   away from what they're doing,
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:50.280]   which is to home in on these low fat, low calorie foods.
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:51.780]   And they can't seem to set shift.
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:54.100]   They can't just relax and enjoy the meal
[01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:56.820]   because the meal for them is essentially
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:58.180]   like this where's Waldo
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:00.080]   or find the face in the coffee bean task.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:02.300]   They're constantly monitoring
[01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:04.040]   how much people are observing them
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:05.700]   and trying to navigate this,
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:08.240]   what would otherwise be a really pleasant circumstance
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.080]   for most people.
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.440]   They're trying to navigate through this
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:12.060]   because remember for them,
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:14.900]   the reward is in the avoidance of certain things
[01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:17.380]   and the acquiring of only the foods
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:19.120]   that their brain rewards them for
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:21.220]   because those are the foods that have been pre-selected
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:22.580]   and are now habit.
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:27.200]   What's amazing and frankly also important
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.760]   are these findings that once you teach anorexics
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:33.100]   what's happening to them, that they're doing this,
[01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:35.000]   they are able to intervene.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.200]   Now they need support, right?
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.280]   And another form of therapy that seems to work well
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:43.300]   for anorexics that ideally is combined
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:47.960]   with this habit rewiring is a family-based model.
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:50.560]   Family-based models are starting to surface a lot now
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.860]   in various therapy settings.
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:55.340]   Therapy-based models in short are basically
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:57.860]   where the entire family is made aware
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:33:59.480]   of the individual's challenges
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:01.980]   with a particular eating disorder or other disorder.
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:04.420]   And in understanding some of the biology
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:05.980]   and psychology around it,
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:08.380]   they stop condemning the individual.
[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:10.080]   They start to support that individual
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:12.940]   through queuing them towards their own habits
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:13.780]   that they observe.
[01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:14.920]   They give them some autonomy.
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:17.180]   They realize that none of this changes overnight,
[01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:19.540]   but they're taught about things like neuroplasticity
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:21.120]   and the ability to change one's brain
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:22.420]   in response to experience.
[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:25.520]   And so there's a whole internal support network.
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:27.360]   Now for people that live alone,
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:28.620]   this isn't available to them.
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:29.460]   This isn't the kind of thing
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:30.540]   that you share with your coworkers.
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:33.500]   You might involve a close friend or a spouse,
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:35.740]   but it's not the sort of thing that people
[01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:38.540]   that don't live in a family context
[01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:40.400]   can really benefit from.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:43.040]   All of these things fall under the umbrella
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.900]   of cognitive behavioral therapy.
[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:47.300]   And I should mention that cognitive behavioral therapies
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:51.000]   are often done in conjunction with pharmacologic therapies.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.120]   I think that there's this idea out there
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:56.080]   that it's either or when often it's both.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.440]   So cognitive behavioral therapies are often combined
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:02.780]   with this habit recognition and rewiring approach,
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:04.920]   which is starting to become more and more common.
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.480]   And I think the data on it look really good
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:11.800]   that especially when individuals are taught this early
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:16.500]   in adolescence, that there are positive outcomes over time.
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:19.020]   The relapse rate of anorexia is quite high.
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:21.820]   It's about 50% of individuals will relapse at some point,
[01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:24.360]   often triggered by a stressful life circumstance.
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:27.540]   But the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:29.260]   that includes this family model,
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:33.380]   or at least habit reformation seems to be fairly effective.
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:36.060]   And at present might be the most effective treatment.
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:38.580]   Now there are additional treatments starting to surface,
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:41.880]   and that takes us into the realm of chemical treatments
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:42.740]   for anorexia.
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:46.660]   And I just want to mention that there are clinical trials,
[01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:48.760]   meaning legal clinical trials being done
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.040]   at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:51.840]   by Matthew Johnson and others,
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:55.500]   exploring how drugs like MDMA,
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:58.880]   which increases dopamine and serotonin to very high levels,
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.960]   or psilocybin, so-called magic mushrooms,
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:04.500]   which increases serotonin and other compounds
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:05.980]   to very high levels,
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:09.540]   within the confines of a professionally supported
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:13.380]   therapeutic environment can help people rewire their brain
[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:15.980]   such that they can get relief from major depression
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:17.380]   and various forms of trauma.
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:20.900]   And now eating disorders are also being explored
[01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:24.960]   in the context of MDMA and psilocybin clinical trials.
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:28.660]   I do want to emphasize that those are clinical trials,
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:30.700]   that those compounds are not yet legal.
[01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:34.980]   And in many cases, most cases, they are still illegal.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:37.860]   I do not think that they should be explored
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:42.160]   without a properly trained medical doctor,
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:44.580]   that the clinical trials are essential to complete
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:48.500]   before one explores those compounds in particular,
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:51.420]   because lately I get a lot of emails about these compounds,
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:53.940]   people telling me that they've had amazing experiences
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:56.540]   and relief from various things, not just eating disorders,
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:58.200]   but depression, et cetera.
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:02.540]   However, I get an equal number of emails from people saying
[01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:05.660]   that they worked with some self-appointed guide.
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:07.280]   This would be outside the clinical trials
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:08.500]   I was referring to.
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:12.140]   And they are now experiencing chronic visual snow.
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:14.960]   They're getting genuine visual field deficits.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:18.020]   They are having tics that they never had before.
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:19.260]   They have chronic insomnia.
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:22.820]   So I'm not passing judgment on any of these compounds
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:24.460]   or the people that are doing this sort of thing.
[01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:26.720]   I just want to see the clinical data.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.380]   And I do believe that we should wait
[01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:30.340]   until these clinical trials are done
[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:32.540]   before people start approaching this stuff.
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:36.660]   And that's because they are serious compounds.
[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:40.180]   They can open plasticity, but whether or not they work,
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:43.700]   quote unquote, for different types of eating disorders
[01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:47.780]   or depression and trauma, the data are looking promising,
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:50.140]   but that the clinical trials are still not done.
[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:52.360]   And I know a number of people are going out of the US
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:55.020]   and into other countries where this stuff is being done
[01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:55.940]   more regularly.
[01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:58.220]   And there too, I've gotten reports back
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:00.540]   of people doing so-called Ibogaine treatments.
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:02.900]   Some of you who are familiar with eating disorders
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:05.300]   will immediately be asking, well, what about Ibogaine?
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:06.500]   Does it work? Does it work?
[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:09.540]   Well, the clinical trials in this country are not complete.
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:13.300]   I've heard evidence direct.
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:16.940]   I've heard directly from people who have benefited
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:19.420]   from the sorts of things for treatment of eating disorders.
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:21.740]   But I've also heard of people that have developed
[01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:25.620]   chronic seizure disorders from pursuing things like Ibogaine
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:28.440]   for the treatment of eating disorders.
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:29.860]   So again, I'm not passing judgment.
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:31.700]   I would just like to see more data.
[01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:35.880]   And it's very important that the aspects of safety
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:36.720]   be in place.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:39.780]   So this is definitely not something to get renegade about.
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:42.940]   So it appears that once anorexia is established,
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:45.940]   that habit breaking through self-awareness
[01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:50.520]   of what the habits are is going to be a primary entry point.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:52.540]   That might seem kind of trivial.
[01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:53.380]   You might say, well,
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:55.060]   couldn't you have just told us that in one sentence?
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:58.220]   But I want to return us to this model
[01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:01.820]   about homeostatic processes, reward processes, et cetera.
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:06.220]   That leads us to a place where the short answer is no.
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:09.100]   You can't simply say break the habit.
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:11.260]   An individual needs to be informed
[01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:13.060]   about where that habit comes from.
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:17.660]   And the fact that what currently seems like a rewarded habit
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:20.240]   should actually be a punished habit.
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:22.520]   Now, I don't mean by actual punishment,
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:25.020]   but what I mean is within the brain,
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:27.380]   there's been a switch and the anorexic
[01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:29.180]   needs to learn that there's been a switch
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:32.940]   such that what should be rewarding is now punished
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:35.900]   and what should be punished, starvation is now rewarded.
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:38.880]   The beauty of being a human being
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:42.260]   is that knowledge of knowledge
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:44.560]   can allow you to make better decisions.
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:46.540]   I'll say that again.
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:47.740]   The beauty of being a human being
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:49.100]   is that knowledge of knowledge
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:50.980]   can allow you to make better decisions.
[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:53.760]   Now, of course, when we are anxious,
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:58.360]   when we are tired, when we are intoxicated,
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.940]   we have less access to that ability
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:03.720]   to use knowledge of knowledge to intervene.
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:05.740]   The anorexic will often do things
[01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:07.700]   that are in keeping with their habits,
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:09.180]   such as overexercising.
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:12.540]   This is a area that anyone who's treated anorexics
[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:15.120]   or interacted with anorexics is well aware of
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:17.220]   that they are constantly moving.
[01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:18.540]   They're constantly on the treadmill.
[01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:19.620]   They're constantly running.
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:22.180]   They always want to be moving and burning calories
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:25.140]   so that they can feel okay about interacting with food
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:27.960]   or because they have the distorted body image.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:30.920]   Well, does breaking a habit mean
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:33.340]   that they should stop moving around and exercising?
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:34.820]   No, not necessarily.
[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:36.300]   There's some really interesting studies
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:41.300]   that show that shifting anorexics towards activities
[01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:44.920]   that, for instance, build muscle resistance training
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:47.900]   and allow them to eat a bit more food
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:51.660]   without necessarily losing weight,
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:54.740]   but rather to put more muscle on their body
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:55.860]   can actually be beneficial.
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:58.740]   Now, I'm not talking about anorexics becoming bodybuilders.
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:00.420]   There's a whole body dysmorphia associated
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:01.620]   with bodybuilding.
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:04.820]   But certain forms of exercise are just catabolic,
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:06.500]   meaning they break down the amount of muscle.
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:08.860]   They reduce body weight overall.
[01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:11.980]   Other types of exercises like resistance training
[01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:13.460]   are anabolic.
[01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:15.340]   They allow muscle to be put on.
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:18.220]   And there are some interesting studies, not a lot,
[01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:21.700]   but some interesting studies trying to encourage anorexics
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:25.160]   not to stop exercising, but rather to stop exercising
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:28.880]   in this neurotic catabolic way of breaking oneself down,
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:32.580]   but rather getting them shifted toward breaking habits
[01:41:32.580 --> 01:41:34.840]   of only approaching low calorie, low fat foods,
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.940]   while also encouraging them to embark
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:40.340]   on resistance training and to start to learn
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:43.340]   and reward the relationship between exercise
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:45.520]   for sake of making one's body strong,
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.640]   including the bones, not just the muscles,
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:50.600]   but the bones, which is important, especially in anorexics.
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:53.820]   And then to see food as a way to nourish that process,
[01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:56.940]   to building a body that could be of the stable weight,
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:42:00.000]   hopefully once the anorexic is of a healthy weight
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.680]   that they're maintaining that weight,
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:04.300]   but that they don't have to constantly be on this treadmill,
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:08.000]   no pun intended, of balancing whatever food intake
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.500]   they have with activity.
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:12.540]   And along the lines of that,
[01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:15.400]   during the episode on fat loss and metabolism as well,
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:18.740]   I talked about this neat and non-exercise
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:22.460]   induced thermogenesis, where people who tend to be thin
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:24.620]   tend to bounce around a lot, they're kind of fidgety,
[01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:26.640]   and that burns thousands of calories a day,
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:29.180]   anywhere from 800 to 2000 calories a day.
[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:30.940]   Now that can be beneficial for the folks
[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:33.940]   that are overweight and have a healthy mindset about food,
[01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:35.400]   but are trying to lose weight.
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:39.500]   And it turns out that by literally fidgeting
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:40.900]   and bouncing around like this is why I'm doing this,
[01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:44.360]   it looks ridiculous, you actually burn a lot of body fat
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:45.820]   and calories that way,
[01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:48.660]   provided you're in a caloric deficit, you burn body fat,
[01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:50.620]   because body fat is not just a passive tissue,
[01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:52.780]   it actually receives input from neurons
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:54.980]   that release noradrenaline and adrenaline.
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:59.220]   And this neat has been described for several decades now,
[01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:00.860]   and it actually is a pretty terrific way
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:02.220]   to burn off more calories.
[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:06.520]   So with the anorexic, you actually want to encourage them
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:09.580]   to not constantly be trying to burn off calories.
[01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:10.620]   That can be very challenging.
[01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:13.100]   So shifting them toward activities
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:15.860]   like weight-bearing activities or resistance training
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:18.900]   that promote this more anabolic type of relationship
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:22.100]   to activity as opposed to catabolic can be beneficial.
[01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:24.180]   Before we move on to talking about bulimia
[01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:25.640]   and some related disorders,
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:27.460]   I want to talk about an aspect of anorexia
[01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:30.800]   that's very interesting, quite troubling in fact,
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:33.420]   but that has received a lot of attention
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:38.080]   and that's the distorted self image.
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:40.880]   Now, in the episode on depression,
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:45.680]   we talked about a very powerful aspect of major depression,
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:47.680]   which is this anti-self confabulation
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:51.400]   that people who are depressed seem to genuinely believe
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:53.240]   and even confabulate about the fact
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:55.080]   that they are performing poorly in life
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:58.080]   and that they are no good or worthless, et cetera.
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:00.640]   It's literally a lie that they believe
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:02.980]   and their statements and their feelings
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:05.540]   and their behaviors start to reflect that lie.
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:06.460]   They're not conscious of it.
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:08.320]   That's why we call it a confabulation.
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:14.840]   Anorexics often will see themselves as overweight
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:18.780]   or imperfect in ways that are of an obsession for them.
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:19.620]   They'll think, oh, you know,
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:22.320]   their arms are a little bit fat, you know,
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:24.900]   or, you know, the contour of their face makes,
[01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:28.040]   they don't like the pictures of themselves or they,
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:30.640]   what I'm describing here is actually pretty typical behavior
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:31.720]   of a lot of people.
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:32.720]   I mean, how many people do you know
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.160]   that after you take a picture of them,
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:35.400]   they say, can I see the picture?
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:37.560]   And then they tell you that you have to throw it away.
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:39.400]   That doesn't necessarily mean they're anorexic
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:41.360]   or they're suffering from some sort of disorder.
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.760]   That just means that they're a human being
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:45.560]   that cares about how they appear in the world.
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:46.900]   We're not here to judge that.
[01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:48.920]   In the case of the anorexic,
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:53.080]   the problem seems to be that they have a genuine distortion
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:55.860]   of their self-image so much so
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:59.180]   that they don't actually see themselves accurately.
[01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:01.840]   Their visual perceptions are off.
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:03.120]   And the reason we know this
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:05.080]   or it's because of some really important
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:07.480]   and beautiful studies that were done
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:10.000]   in my colleague Jeremy Bailenson's lab at Stanford,
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.680]   he's in the Department of Communications.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.880]   He's actually collaborated with Dr. Halpern
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:15.160]   that I mentioned earlier.
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:16.720]   What's really interesting about these studies
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:19.800]   is they give us a window into the perceptual defect
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:21.600]   that anorexics have.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:23.440]   I've actually done one of these experiments.
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:25.020]   I'm fortunate to not be anorexic,
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:27.080]   but I've done some work with the VR lab over there.
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:29.320]   And what you get to do is you get to adjust
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:31.720]   this avatar of yourself to the point where you think
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:34.640]   it's as accurate as it could possibly be.
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:39.220]   And anorexics really distort this avatar.
[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:42.160]   In other words, they create this serious mismatch
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:44.780]   between their perception of themselves and the reality.
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:47.140]   So indeed it does seem to be the case.
[01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:51.360]   Now what's relieving, or I should say what's encouraging
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:53.720]   about some of the therapies that we talked about before,
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:57.660]   the family-based model, the cognitive behavioral treatments,
[01:45:57.660 --> 01:45:59.600]   yes, and the drug treatments as well,
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:02.880]   but this habit intervention model is that
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:05.680]   as one starts to shift those things,
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:09.600]   it does appear that the perception of self seems to follow,
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:12.520]   that the perception of self seems to shift along
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:14.320]   with the change in habits.
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:17.320]   And that's a relief, at least I find that reassuring
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:21.700]   because changing one's perception is actually very hard.
[01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:24.000]   As somebody who's worked almost his entire career
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.480]   on visual perception and related things,
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.960]   the perceptual apparatus of the brain
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:32.420]   are not very amenable to neuroplasticity.
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:34.560]   I mean, they don't change that easily.
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:37.060]   Whereas it appears that the circuitry
[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:39.480]   that's related to habit formation and decision-making
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:42.920]   and the reward circuitry, that stuff can be rewired.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.000]   And so anorexics, as they progress
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.920]   out of their anorexic state into one
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:51.240]   which they are intervening in their reflexes,
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:52.840]   gaining better habits around food,
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:57.840]   eating more accurately, assessing foods and environments
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:00.420]   that they're in related to food,
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:01.620]   as they change their behavior
[01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:03.100]   and they start to put on healthy weight,
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:04.920]   maybe they're also doing the sorts of exercises
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:06.780]   that allow them to put on healthy weight
[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:10.160]   and avoiding kind of extreme exercises of catabolism
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:11.560]   and breaking themselves down.
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:14.280]   They also managed to somehow,
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:15.920]   just as a consequence of all that,
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:18.400]   rewire their perception of self.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:20.600]   So it doesn't seem that trying to tell someone,
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:23.360]   oh my gosh, you're so thin, you really need to eat,
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:24.880]   that doesn't seem to work.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:27.660]   They just don't see themselves the same way
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:28.720]   that you see them.
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:31.560]   And so I offer that as a point of consideration
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:32.900]   if you know someone that's anorexic,
[01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:34.980]   or if you look at an anorexic and you think,
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:38.740]   how is it that they are still critical of the small,
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:40.580]   even non-existent amount of body fat
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:42.920]   on their triceps or something, how is that?
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:45.340]   Well, it's literally that their brain,
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:46.720]   as it relates to perceptions,
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:48.900]   visual perceptions in particular,
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:50.120]   that they're completely off.
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:52.100]   And fortunately by changing habits,
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:54.200]   you rewire those circuits as well.
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:56.640]   Okay, so let's talk about bulimia,
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:00.800]   which is overeating and then purging,
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:03.080]   typically by self-induced vomiting
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:05.160]   or by ingestion of laxatives,
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:09.400]   sometimes also in concert with people taking stimulants
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:12.440]   and fat burners and over-ingestion of stimulants
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:14.600]   to try and burn off more energy.
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:16.800]   And then we'll also talk about binge eating disorder,
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:19.960]   which has a lot of the same features as bulimia,
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:22.020]   but typically no purging.
[01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:26.420]   I'm not going to list off all the clinical criteria
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:29.440]   that would allow someone to be diagnosed
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:32.420]   as bulimic or binge eating disorder.
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:34.760]   But the general features are that they ingest
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:37.420]   far more calories than they need,
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:42.320]   anywhere from 10 to 30 times their daily caloric intake,
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:45.180]   oftentimes within a two hour period,
[01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:48.360]   which is just a staggering amount of food
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:50.800]   and nutrients in a short period of time.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:53.480]   Oftentimes they're overriding those mechanical signals
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:55.920]   from the body that they're full.
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:58.760]   It's a really troubling thing to think about,
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:01.960]   but people are literally gorging themselves with food.
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:05.120]   This looks a lot like a laboratory animal
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:07.620]   that has these AGRP neurons stimulated,
[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:08.640]   these neurons that will eat
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:11.420]   until they almost burst or burst.
[01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:13.880]   So you wonder, is it these AGRP neurons that are active?
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:16.240]   Almost certainly, yes, that they're involved.
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:17.880]   Although I don't think that that's going to be
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:20.320]   the major point of intervention,
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:23.720]   that we're going to talk about other types of interventions.
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:25.360]   There are a number of clinical criteria.
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:29.440]   For instance, if somebody has one of these binges once a year
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:30.800]   does that make them bulimic?
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:34.920]   Technically, no, but I certainly don't recommend
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:36.540]   people do this.
[01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:38.520]   If you are one of these people
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:40.680]   who has so-called cheat days, right?
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:43.040]   Some of you may be familiar with cheat days.
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.320]   I think they're a little less common now,
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:47.600]   but the idea is you eat clean for six days
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.440]   or five days a week or two weeks,
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:50.600]   and then you have a so-called cheat day
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:52.980]   where you just kind of go wild and eat whatever you want
[01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:55.760]   and whatever volumes is that bulimia
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:58.320]   has some of the contour of bulimia.
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:00.760]   If you're vomiting afterwards or binge eating disorder,
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:03.740]   if you're not, does it constitute full-blown bulimia
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:04.860]   or binge eating disorder?
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:06.660]   It's pretty hard to say.
[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:08.180]   The criteria that were described to me
[01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:11.280]   is that if somebody is doing this at least once a month
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:13.820]   over a period of anywhere from two to three months,
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:16.180]   then it likely would qualify.
[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:19.020]   And I certainly know people who do these cheat days
[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:21.280]   and by those criteria,
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:23.800]   they have something like binge eating disorder.
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:26.780]   But in general, one of the hallmark features
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:28.640]   of bulimia and binge eating disorder
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:31.880]   is that people are unable to control their eating.
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:32.780]   They're just simply,
[01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:35.420]   they're not making the decision to have a cheat day.
[01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:37.880]   They're not making the decision to overeat.
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:42.180]   They are simply driven from the inside
[01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:45.520]   without question by way of neural circuitry.
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.780]   They are driven from the inside
[01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:51.260]   to ingest far more food than they need
[01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:54.140]   and in some cases than they would want to eat.
[01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:56.460]   So it's a lot like the habit
[01:50:56.460 --> 01:50:58.640]   that we described for anorexia.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:00.740]   It's almost like it's turned into a reflex
[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:02.080]   once they get going.
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:05.300]   All the homeostatic signals are being overridden.
[01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:08.300]   All the signals from the body, the leptin,
[01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:10.180]   the insulin, the glucose,
[01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:12.240]   all that stuff is cosmically sky high.
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:17.240]   And yet they're just what the nerds call hyperphagic.
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:18.900]   They're just eating like crazy.
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:21.320]   So what's going on there?
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:24.460]   Well, there've been a lot of ideas, you know,
[01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:26.500]   about why this arises.
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:30.500]   There's the so-called thyroid hormone hypothesis.
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:31.760]   That one's a tricky one.
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:33.680]   It turns out that cortisol
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:36.540]   and thyroid hormone concentrations vary
[01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:40.300]   according to when the binge purge happened.
[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:41.440]   So there were some studies
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:43.820]   that looked at thyroid hormone levels
[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:47.080]   and they found elevated thyroid hormone levels.
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:49.420]   Thyroid hormone is involved in metabolism
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:51.920]   and not just the burning of energy,
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:54.780]   but the use of energy in converting it
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:56.220]   to different tissues of the body,
[01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:59.560]   cartilage, bone, fat, and muscle, et cetera.
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:02.580]   Did a whole episode on thyroid and growth hormone,
[01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:03.660]   by the way, if you're interested
[01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:05.660]   in learning more about thyroid hormone.
[01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:10.300]   But thyroid hormone can also be depleted
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:12.740]   at other phases of the binge purge cycle.
[01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:15.940]   Now, without listing off all the terrible things
[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:18.200]   that happen with this binge purge cycle,
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:19.280]   there are a number of things
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:21.400]   that are really worth pointing out.
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:25.220]   One is that the vomiting itself, the use of laxatives,
[01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:29.160]   that can cause severe disruption to the mucosal lining,
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:31.000]   the mucus lining of the digestive tract,
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.100]   can severely disrupt the gut microbiome.
[01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:39.100]   It can cause all sorts of even ulceration of the esophagus
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:41.120]   and just really terrible stuff.
[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:45.700]   There's a lot of shame associated with bulimia,
[01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:48.580]   oftentimes because people are vomiting
[01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:52.000]   and it's hard to hide that vomiting behavior.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.060]   People are aware of it.
[01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:54.820]   There's some social isolation.
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:55.860]   So you recall from the beginning,
[01:52:55.860 --> 01:52:58.380]   it does not appear that sexual trauma
[01:52:58.380 --> 01:53:00.580]   is a prerequisite for bulimia,
[01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:02.340]   although sometimes it can occur.
[01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:04.060]   The hallmark feature of bulimia
[01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:06.780]   that distinguishes it from anorexia,
[01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:08.280]   aside from the fact that it's overeating
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:09.840]   as opposed to undereating,
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:12.780]   is a lack of what they call inhibitory control.
[01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:15.100]   And that might come as no surprise.
[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:20.100]   But first of all, the bulimic, unlike the anorexic,
[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:23.780]   is hyper impulsive
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:26.620]   and oftentimes has other types of impulse behaviors.
[01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:28.560]   They might have a little bit of alcohol
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:30.520]   and then start to eat like crazy,
[01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:32.020]   whereas normally they're very restrictive.
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:34.800]   That's a common feature of bulimia.
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:38.140]   Sometimes they over ingest alcohol during these binges.
[01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:41.940]   Sometimes they are sexually promiscuous, not always,
[01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:45.140]   but it's a general issue with satiety
[01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:48.740]   once they start eating and with impulse control generally.
[01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:50.380]   And for that reason,
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:52.380]   many of the treatments that you see for bulimia
[01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:55.140]   and binge eating disorder are the sorts of treatments
[01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:57.500]   that don't seem to work so well,
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:00.140]   or at least most of the time for anorexia.
[01:54:00.140 --> 01:54:04.160]   So the drugs that increase the neuromodulator serotonin,
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:06.860]   for instance, fluoxetine,
[01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:09.580]   also called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera,
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:13.860]   those things oftentimes can be effective in bulimia.
[01:54:13.860 --> 01:54:15.540]   Some of the drugs that are used to treat
[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:17.980]   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and ADD,
[01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:20.140]   a topic that we're going to talk about in depth
[01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:22.280]   here on the podcast soon,
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:25.060]   some of those same drugs like Adderall,
[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:27.180]   Vyvanse and things of that sort
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:31.620]   can also be used to treat bulimia and binge eating disorder.
[01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:32.620]   Why would that work?
[01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:35.260]   Well, now you are familiar with the prefrontal cortex.
[01:54:35.260 --> 01:54:36.740]   You probably know more about prefrontal cortex
[01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:38.180]   than you ever wanted to.
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:42.540]   Just from this episode, prefrontal cortex is involved
[01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:45.420]   in this analysis of duration, path and outcome.
[01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:49.940]   Duration, path and outcome is how we avoid impulsivity.
[01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:52.060]   It's how we think, okay, if this, then that,
[01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:52.900]   if that, then this,
[01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:54.840]   you can imagine how for the obsessive compulsive
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:59.380]   or for the anorexic, these are circuits that are overactive.
[01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:02.480]   For the bulimic, this is the circuit
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:05.060]   that's going to essentially be underactive
[01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:07.280]   and is under conditions where they think,
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:09.300]   oh, I shouldn't eat anything, I shouldn't eat anything.
[01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:12.120]   And then they just tear the refrigerator open
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:13.660]   and plow through that.
[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:15.060]   And then at that point,
[01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:16.180]   they're plowing through the cupboards
[01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:17.320]   and then they're ordering food.
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:19.380]   And then they're feeling horrible about themselves.
[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:22.860]   There do tend to be these cycles of binge and purge
[01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:25.980]   followed by feelings of real shame
[01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:28.660]   because they just can't control their behavior.
[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:29.960]   And what is more embarrassing
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:32.020]   than not being able to control one's behavior
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:34.620]   as an adult or as a young adult.
[01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:36.860]   So really the polar opposite of what you see
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:38.580]   in anorexia.
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:40.800]   So this lack of impulsivity
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:43.000]   implies a lack of prefrontal control,
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.180]   what we call top-down control.
[01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:45.060]   Why do we call it top-down?
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:48.060]   Because the prefrontal cortex is suppressing the activity
[01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:51.940]   of deeper limbic and hypothalamic circuitry
[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:53.580]   and things of that sort.
[01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:56.660]   Anytime you feel like you want to say something
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:56:01.660]   really offensive and you don't, that's top-down control.
[01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:03.120]   That's your prefrontal cortex.
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:06.060]   Anytime someone says something and you like,
[01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:07.140]   like grit your teeth
[01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:08.840]   'cause you know you shouldn't say anything,
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:11.740]   gritting your teeth is top-down control, okay?
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:15.020]   When you explode or burst or say the wrong thing
[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:17.260]   or say the thing that you shouldn't say
[01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:18.580]   or do the thing you shouldn't do,
[01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:20.260]   that's lack of prefrontal control.
[01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:22.640]   And indeed people who have frontotemporal dementia
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:25.260]   due to aging or head injuries see this a lot
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:29.640]   and people play sports that get a lot of frontal damage,
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:31.220]   they become more impulsive.
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:35.600]   So bulimics have an issue with impulsivity.
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:39.540]   And therefore drugs that can increase serotonin
[01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:42.380]   and sometimes these drugs that increase dopamine
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:45.120]   and adrenaline, also called epinephrine,
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:47.740]   will increase the tone, as we call it,
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:51.060]   the dopaminergic tone or the norepinephrine,
[01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:52.220]   it's called adrenergic,
[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:54.580]   but norepinephrine levels in the brain
[01:56:54.580 --> 01:56:56.260]   allow for more top-down control.
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:58.840]   And that's also why they're used to treat ADHD
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:00.480]   and attention deficit disorder.
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:03.540]   They tend to create a hyperfocus.
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:05.620]   They tend to push the brain into,
[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:07.200]   these drugs tend to create a hyperfocus
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:08.480]   and tend to push the brain
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:11.220]   and general mode of processing into one in which you think,
[01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:13.300]   if this, then that, if this, then that,
[01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:15.260]   so anticipating outcomes.
[01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:20.160]   And for that reason, drugs like Wellbutrin, buprenerone,
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:21.260]   which is an antidepressant,
[01:57:21.260 --> 01:57:23.960]   which mainly increases the amount of dopamine
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:26.740]   and norepinephrine and less so serotonin,
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:27.860]   that can also be effective
[01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:29.860]   for certain types of binge eating disorder
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:32.620]   is actually used to treat smoking
[01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:37.180]   for promoting smoking cessation and for depression,
[01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:39.860]   but also for certain forms of obesity
[01:57:39.860 --> 01:57:41.560]   related to binge eating disorder.
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:42.700]   And the data are pretty good
[01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:44.500]   and there are timed release forms of this
[01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:45.620]   and non-timed release forms.
[01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:49.220]   And I think you have to consult with a psychiatrist
[01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:50.620]   in order to get these prescribed
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:51.900]   because they are prescription drugs,
[01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:55.220]   but it's a very different constellation of neurochemicals
[01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:59.200]   and brain areas and approaches for bulimia.
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:01.540]   The treatment of binge eating disorder
[01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:05.260]   has been explored from a new standpoint recently,
[01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:07.980]   and that's the work of this now, sadly,
[01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:10.340]   former colleague of mine, Dr. Casey Halpern,
[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:13.380]   who's at University of Pennsylvania
[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:14.760]   that I mentioned earlier.
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:17.420]   They are using deep brain stimulation
[01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:19.740]   in order to treat binge eating disorder.
[01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:21.660]   Now, why deep brain stimulation?
[01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:26.660]   Well, work from Dr. Halpern and others while at Stanford
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:30.380]   showed that there are particular patterns of brain activity
[01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:33.300]   in both the prefrontal cortex,
[01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:34.900]   but also in an area of the brain
[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:36.580]   called the nucleus accumbens,
[01:58:36.580 --> 01:58:40.260]   very important and very relevant area of the brain
[01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:41.120]   in this context.
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:45.620]   And in any discussion about motivated behaviors of any kind,
[01:58:45.620 --> 01:58:48.840]   feeding, sex, drug related behavior,
[01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:51.260]   people exercise compulsively,
[01:58:51.260 --> 01:58:54.640]   the nucleus accumbens is in a ongoing dialogue
[01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:55.860]   with the prefrontal cortex.
[01:58:55.860 --> 01:58:58.660]   And the nucleus accumbens has no mind of its own,
[01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:00.420]   but it's associated with dopamine release.
[01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:03.460]   It's part of this so-called reward pathway.
[01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:06.540]   And what Dr. Halpern and colleagues discovered
[01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:09.160]   is that there are particular patterns of activity
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:11.100]   that ripple through the brain
[01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:12.940]   through these prefrontal networks
[01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:14.980]   and through this nucleus accumbens area,
[01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:18.980]   those areas are connected, it's called delta oscillations,
[01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:21.300]   delta just being a particular frequency
[01:59:21.300 --> 01:59:23.620]   of electrical activity for you aficionados
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:25.320]   is one to four Hertz activity.
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:29.540]   But in any case, those delta oscillations
[01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:33.360]   in the nucleus accumbens are associated with food reward
[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:35.060]   in both mice and humans.
[01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:38.280]   Somehow this reverberatory activity
[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:40.400]   creates a perception in the individual
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:42.440]   that food is hyper rewarding.
[01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:46.100]   That's interesting and has allowed them to use
[01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:48.820]   a targeted deep brain stimulation approach
[01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:50.740]   to treat binge eating disorder.
[01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:53.140]   And this deep brain stimulation
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:55.360]   is appearing to be an effective treatment.
[01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:57.880]   There's still more studies that need to be done.
[01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:01.640]   Actually, if you think you have binge eating disorder,
[02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:03.960]   you can find the criteria for that
[02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:06.600]   and you could contact Dr. Halpern.
[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:08.640]   As I mentioned, he's moving to University of Pennsylvania.
[02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:12.240]   They are recruiting patients for these studies all the time.
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:13.600]   The studies are fairly invasive.
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:16.760]   They involve a FDA approved approach
[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:21.040]   of literally placing a wire down into an area of the brain
[02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:24.300]   that then allows the individual
[02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:26.740]   to stimulate a particular brain area
[02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:30.060]   to offset some of these activity patterns
[02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:33.960]   that lead to a elevated sense of reward
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:35.740]   from food and binge eating.
[02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:37.420]   And the data look really promising.
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:39.680]   Now I realize that's a very invasive approach.
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:42.040]   Not everybody is going to be willing
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:44.500]   to have this wire inserted into the brain,
[02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:47.080]   but for people that suffer from binge eating disorder,
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:52.080]   this is a great and very exciting potential treatment,
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:53.900]   because what I didn't tell you
[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:57.140]   is that many people who have binge eating disorder are obese
[02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:59.800]   to the point where their health is greatly at risk.
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:03.760]   Now, obesity causes all sorts of shifts
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:06.440]   in the dialogue between the brain and body,
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:07.960]   some of which you'll recognize
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:09.920]   from earlier in the discussion.
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:13.580]   For instance, leptin signaling is disrupted.
[02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:16.160]   So the fat, there's lots of body fat,
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:18.000]   but even though that body fat
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.400]   is secreting this hormone leptin
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:23.160]   and that signal should shut down the desire to eat,
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:26.920]   the receptors to leptin in the brain are totally screwed up.
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:29.060]   And so the signal to eat is there,
[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:31.360]   but the signal to stop eating is not there.
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:33.060]   So again, you have an accelerator and a brake,
[02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:35.660]   and it's like the accelerator is always pushed down.
[02:01:35.660 --> 02:01:37.340]   Some of these brain stimulation approaches
[02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:40.020]   seem to be able to bypass some of that.
[02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:42.020]   And of course, there are all the metabolic syndromes
[02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:45.700]   and the problems with having excess levels of body fat,
[02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:48.620]   things like insulin resistance, type two diabetes.
[02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:52.640]   I mean, as disturbing as is to hear,
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:53.780]   there are many individuals, actually,
[02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:57.560]   I know some who are so obese
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:01:59.700]   that they start getting bodily sores.
[02:01:59.700 --> 02:02:00.660]   They're not just bed sores,
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:05.020]   but they have skin sores that are very disruptive to them.
[02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:06.800]   They don't like having these sores.
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:08.280]   And in addition to that,
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:10.260]   they can get peripheral neuropathies
[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:12.880]   because of some of these metabolic issues.
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:16.000]   They're not getting enough utilization
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:17.840]   of the nutrients in the tissue
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:20.760]   because the way that insulin is disrupted,
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:22.840]   insulin signaling, and they actually have to have
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:24.700]   certain portions of their limbs amputated,
[02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:26.540]   and yet they continue to overeat.
[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:29.280]   So this is not an issue of self-control
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:31.560]   that can easily be dealt with
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:32.640]   simply by telling the person,
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:34.900]   look, you have to stop eating or you're going to die,
[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:36.900]   or you're going to have your legs amputated.
[02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:38.280]   Like with anorexia,
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:41.800]   there's a distortion in the relationship to food,
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:45.820]   but the homeostatic and the reward aspects are disrupted.
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:47.060]   So unlike anorexia,
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:50.140]   where it seems to be a habit-based mechanism
[02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:53.160]   with bulimia and binge eating disorder,
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:54.860]   something deep within the neural circuitry
[02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:58.240]   is causing food to be hyper attractive
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:00.080]   and the break is off.
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:02.140]   So if you want to develop some empathy
[02:03:02.140 --> 02:03:04.720]   for what these people are dealing with, consider this.
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:06.440]   It's like driving a car.
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:10.600]   You get onto a grade, maybe a 10 or 15 degree grade,
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:13.440]   and you're heading down and you figure,
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:15.260]   well, you'll just pump the brakes a little bit,
[02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:16.760]   but there is no break, right?
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:18.880]   So you start going faster and faster and faster,
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:20.740]   and your only choice is to use the accelerator
[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:21.680]   or just to coast through it.
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:24.460]   That's essentially what's happening to these neural circuits.
[02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:26.400]   So the work of Dr. Halpern and others,
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:28.140]   I think is really exciting.
[02:03:28.140 --> 02:03:29.820]   And even though it's highly invasive,
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:33.120]   I think it's going to lead to not just some relief
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:35.560]   for the patients that do get that deep brain stimulation,
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:38.360]   but also the identification of what sorts of receptors
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:41.480]   are present in those brain areas that could help.
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:44.320]   What that means is that once we understand
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:46.520]   which brain areas are involved in the disorder
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:51.400]   and we understand what receptors those brain areas express,
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:54.080]   then there can start to be additional interventions
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:56.840]   by way of non-invasive treatments,
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:58.800]   things like drug treatments.
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:01.360]   Do behavioral interventions work for bulimia?
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:02.980]   In some cases, yes,
[02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:06.140]   provided that those interventions are done early enough.
[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:09.320]   Regardless, behavioral interventions
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:11.040]   coupled with drug-based interventions
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:13.320]   are always more effective than either one alone.
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:17.100]   Fortunately, there is a decent size kit of drugs
[02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:18.100]   that can help with bulimia.
[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:19.300]   I mentioned some of them before,
[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:21.680]   things like buprenterone, wellbutrin,
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:23.440]   some of the serotonergic drugs
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:26.120]   and some of the drugs used to treat impulsivity.
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:29.840]   So we have on the one hand anorexia,
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:31.660]   which seems to be a disruption in habit
[02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:35.120]   and a coupling of unhealthy habits,
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:39.160]   in this case, food restriction, to the reward pathway.
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:40.360]   And on the flip side,
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:42.800]   we have binge eating disorder and bulimia
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:46.160]   where a very unhealthy habit of gorging oneself with food,
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:48.080]   sometimes followed by purging,
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:49.940]   is not necessarily coupled to reward.
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:52.000]   They feel terrible when they do that, right?
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.200]   The anorexic feels great
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:54.920]   about restricting their food intake.
[02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:57.020]   They feel like they're winning some sort of game.
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:04:59.640]   The circuitry is flipped somehow that way.
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:03.200]   With bulimia, they feel horrible
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:04.640]   about the fact that they're binging.
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:05.960]   There's immense shame.
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:08.040]   They can't control themselves.
[02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:10.940]   The reward is set up before the behavior.
[02:05:10.940 --> 02:05:15.020]   The reward is set up in drawing them to food
[02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:17.120]   and in making food look like something
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:21.420]   that's incredibly appetizing and there's no impulse break.
[02:05:21.420 --> 02:05:24.100]   There's no way for them to stop that kind of behavior.
[02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:26.640]   So really kind of troubling thing to think about.
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:28.960]   In either case, I think for those of us
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:31.760]   that know anorexics or have observed anorexia,
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:34.100]   it's so hard to see somebody starve themselves
[02:05:34.100 --> 02:05:35.400]   to near death or to death.
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:37.760]   What more could be disturbing?
[02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:41.960]   Well, equally disturbing is somebody who has an abundance
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:43.520]   of food and is gorging themselves
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:45.100]   and then feels terrible about it.
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:48.800]   So these are heavy topics.
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:51.520]   These are topics that frankly,
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:53.040]   no one really wants to talk about
[02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:55.000]   unless they know someone who's suffering from them
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:56.940]   or they themselves suffer from them.
[02:05:56.940 --> 02:05:59.720]   What I've tried to do today is try and give you a window
[02:05:59.720 --> 02:06:02.700]   into what really underlies these things
[02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:05.080]   that we call eating disorders.
[02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:07.460]   I hope I've done that at the level of biology,
[02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:09.620]   neurocircuitry, mechanism, endocrinology,
[02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:11.120]   and some of the psychology.
[02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:14.100]   As with any episode of this podcast,
[02:06:14.100 --> 02:06:16.100]   but especially in this month where we're talking
[02:06:16.100 --> 02:06:19.320]   about mental health issues and mental health disorders,
[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:22.040]   behavioral disorders, there's no way
[02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:24.600]   that I can exhaustively cover all the different forms
[02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:25.440]   of treatment.
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:26.440]   You have the modally approach.
[02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:29.000]   You've got all these different approaches to depression
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.580]   and to anorexia, et cetera.
[02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:33.860]   What I've tried to do is give you a framework.
[02:06:33.860 --> 02:06:36.020]   And in doing that, I've tried to give you a framework
[02:06:36.020 --> 02:06:39.080]   of understanding that also applies to this question
[02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:41.600]   that's I think equally important
[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:43.780]   and goes alongside the treatment of eating disorders
[02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:46.220]   is what in the world is healthy eating?
[02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:48.640]   What in the world is a healthy relationship to food?
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:51.000]   I like to think that I have a healthy relationship to food.
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.220]   I know the foods I like, I enjoy them.
[02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:55.000]   There are 10 or 15 foods in particular
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.080]   that I like very much.
[02:06:56.080 --> 02:06:58.200]   I've mentioned a few of them on the podcast before
[02:06:58.200 --> 02:07:03.200]   and was sort of amused, surprised, and perplexed
[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:06.660]   as to why, for instance, I do enjoy eating butter,
[02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:09.300]   not in huge amounts, but I do like butter.
[02:07:09.300 --> 02:07:12.440]   So that seemed to be pretty triggering for folks out there.
[02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:14.780]   A small selection of people decided
[02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:17.460]   that the ingestion of butter was a health concern.
[02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:22.460]   Look, to me, ingesting butter in small quantities
[02:07:22.460 --> 02:07:23.920]   is something that I'm comfortable with
[02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:26.260]   and my blood lipid profiles feel good.
[02:07:26.260 --> 02:07:27.720]   They look good to me.
[02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:29.940]   For other people, that might not be the case.
[02:07:29.940 --> 02:07:33.060]   For some people, the idea of eating an animal-based food
[02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:35.940]   is probably so repulsive
[02:07:35.940 --> 02:07:39.360]   that it actually can make them feel physically sick.
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:41.240]   And I think that we should be aware
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:43.820]   that that kind of mental phenotype exists.
[02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:45.320]   I'm not calling it a pathology.
[02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:46.660]   For other people like myself,
[02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:48.840]   things like butter and meat feel healthy.
[02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:49.960]   Now, what quantities?
[02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:51.900]   Well, I enjoy eating very much.
[02:07:51.900 --> 02:07:52.860]   I'm not shy about this.
[02:07:52.860 --> 02:07:54.920]   I've talked about it in the podcast before.
[02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:56.480]   I enjoy eating.
[02:07:56.480 --> 02:08:00.080]   Some people have a very complicated relationship to food.
[02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:01.720]   They don't think of it as nourishment.
[02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:03.700]   They don't enjoy it socially.
[02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:05.180]   It's a stressful thing for them
[02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:06.940]   based on their personal history
[02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:10.740]   or maybe just general anxiety around food.
[02:08:10.740 --> 02:08:13.020]   And I hope that in sharing this information
[02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:16.540]   about the fact that anytime we approach food,
[02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:20.240]   these neurons in the arcuate area of our hypothalamus
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:22.260]   actually increase our levels of anxiety.
[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:24.880]   This is related to that point that Dr. Halpern made,
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:27.800]   which was that from an evolutionary standpoint,
[02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:30.140]   it is advantageous to ingest as much food
[02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:32.520]   as often as possible, as quickly as possible.
[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:35.260]   We now know that to not be healthy in this age of abundance
[02:08:35.260 --> 02:08:39.540]   where calories are essentially everywhere.
[02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:44.540]   And yet a lot of people feel anxious
[02:08:44.540 --> 02:08:45.840]   in anticipation of a meal.
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:47.340]   What could be useful to them?
[02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:50.240]   Well, whether or not they have an eating disorder or not,
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:53.940]   it's very clear that developing methods to calm oneself
[02:08:53.940 --> 02:08:55.760]   in the presence of any anxiety
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:57.940]   or fear inducing stimulus can be beneficial.
[02:08:57.940 --> 02:08:58.980]   I've talked about some of these
[02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:00.820]   in episodes related to stress,
[02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:02.220]   things like the physiological side,
[02:09:02.220 --> 02:09:04.700]   two inhales through the nose and a long exhale.
[02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:07.180]   Things like mindfulness meditation certainly can help.
[02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:08.900]   There are data, a lot of studies out there
[02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:11.860]   showing that meditation practice can help people deal with
[02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:14.460]   eating related anxiety and disorders.
[02:09:14.460 --> 02:09:15.580]   I think as a general rule,
[02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:18.020]   trying to avoid approaching a meal
[02:09:18.020 --> 02:09:21.100]   or sitting down to eat in an anxious state
[02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:22.860]   is probably a good idea, but let's be realistic.
[02:09:22.860 --> 02:09:23.960]   How often can we do that?
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:27.060]   I think most of us are going to have circumstances
[02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:29.380]   where we're rushing around trying to just eat
[02:09:29.380 --> 02:09:31.180]   before we head out or get to a meal.
[02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:33.560]   And then we sit down and we find ourselves eating.
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:35.940]   This is one of the first times in human evolution
[02:09:35.940 --> 02:09:40.940]   where we mostly eat out of a desire to consume food,
[02:09:40.940 --> 02:09:43.100]   not out of a need for food.
[02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:46.860]   Most everybody could go a fairly long period of time
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:49.260]   just ingesting water and electrolytes
[02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:50.800]   and not that I'm suggesting people do that,
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:52.180]   but let's face it.
[02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:55.180]   We largely eat nowadays because of a desire to eat,
[02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:56.700]   not a need to eat.
[02:09:56.700 --> 02:09:59.780]   And yet we need to eat on a fairly regular basis.
[02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:04.700]   And so no topic is more complicated and nuanced
[02:10:04.700 --> 02:10:06.540]   than food and nutrition.
[02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:08.620]   And in particular, as it relates to eating disorder.
[02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:11.980]   So the major takeaways today are,
[02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:13.140]   we should all be asking the question,
[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:15.220]   what is healthy eating for us?
[02:10:15.220 --> 02:10:17.580]   How do we develop a relationship to food
[02:10:17.580 --> 02:10:19.420]   that we can enjoy food,
[02:10:19.420 --> 02:10:21.780]   hopefully both socially and on our own,
[02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:24.860]   but that we are not neurotic and compulsive about it.
[02:10:24.860 --> 02:10:26.500]   For those of you that intermittent fast,
[02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:28.180]   this also applies, right?
[02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:29.500]   What, you know, God forbid,
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:32.060]   if you eat 30 minutes before your eating window starts,
[02:10:32.060 --> 02:10:32.900]   what does that mean?
[02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:34.860]   If it means something catastrophic,
[02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:35.980]   do you have an eating disorder?
[02:10:35.980 --> 02:10:38.660]   I don't know, maybe you have an anxiety disorder.
[02:10:38.660 --> 02:10:40.580]   That's for you to explore.
[02:10:40.580 --> 02:10:44.020]   If you don't manage to eat five meals a day
[02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:45.060]   and that's your obsession,
[02:10:45.060 --> 02:10:47.820]   well then, you know, the same thing applies.
[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:50.100]   These are questions that we can all ask ourselves.
[02:10:50.100 --> 02:10:54.540]   Today we focus on the extremes of food related behaviors
[02:10:54.540 --> 02:10:57.940]   that really qualify as genuine disorders.
[02:10:57.940 --> 02:11:01.900]   They are in the psychiatric manuals and they are diagnosable
[02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:04.940]   and they are serious health concerns.
[02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:07.420]   They're not just mentally troubling and concerning
[02:11:07.420 --> 02:11:08.680]   for the people suffering from them
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:09.740]   and the people around them,
[02:11:09.740 --> 02:11:11.980]   but they are genuine health concerns.
[02:11:11.980 --> 02:11:15.000]   Just want to reiterate that anorexia nervosa
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:19.740]   is the most deadly psychiatric disorder by a huge margin.
[02:11:19.740 --> 02:11:22.200]   And if you look statistically at the number of people
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:25.640]   with eating disorders and that die of eating disorders,
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:27.680]   it's not far off from the number of people
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:29.940]   that die from automobile accidents.
[02:11:29.940 --> 02:11:31.940]   I know that that sounds like a ridiculous number,
[02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:32.780]   but you can look this up.
[02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:35.480]   This is particularly true in certain countries.
[02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:37.200]   Why that is, we don't know.
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:40.020]   But again, this is not a new phenomenon.
[02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:44.440]   This is not just related to body image issues
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:46.920]   that are created through social media and media.
[02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:48.760]   And as a final point on that,
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:51.040]   many of you are probably asking,
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:53.540]   what about plastic surgery?
[02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:56.700]   What about all the steps that people are going to through,
[02:11:56.700 --> 02:11:59.460]   excuse me, to preen themselves and change themselves?
[02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:01.780]   Are people addicted to plastic surgery?
[02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:03.980]   Is that a form of body dysmorphia?
[02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:04.820]   And indeed it is.
[02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:08.440]   And so we will do an episode on exercise related
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:11.900]   and plastic surgery related body dysmorphia.
[02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:14.360]   I think there is very little question
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:19.360]   that those types of disorders are clearly related
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:23.620]   to what we're observing in social media and in media,
[02:12:23.620 --> 02:12:27.060]   that this shift of, for instance, action heroes,
[02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:29.160]   if you look at action heroes in the '80s,
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:31.520]   there were very few men that were very large.
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:34.000]   You had your Stallone's and your Schwarzenegger's
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.200]   and a few others.
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:39.040]   But the men in movies tended to be, if they were muscular,
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:41.680]   they were far more svelte than they are now.
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:42.520]   There's this kind of,
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:45.360]   there's literally a hypertrophy of the imagery.
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:48.480]   And likewise, there's been hypertrophy
[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:51.480]   of the female body shape as it's portrayed in the media.
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:55.260]   There are body dysmorpheas that are related
[02:12:55.260 --> 02:12:56.560]   to those types of things.
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:58.840]   And that relate to things like plastic surgery,
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:03.500]   steroid abuse, diet drug abuse, and so on.
[02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:06.560]   Definitely important to think about and consider
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:08.840]   and definitely deserving of its own episode.
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:12.080]   You've learned a lot of neuroscience today.
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:14.720]   I hope that was useful in thinking about these disorders
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:17.400]   and in thinking about other aspects of feeding
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:18.860]   and motivated behaviors.
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:21.680]   I would love for you to take away this model
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:24.040]   that was handed off to me that I think is so powerful
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:26.520]   for thinking about all sorts of things, not just eating,
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:28.240]   but all kinds of behaviors and perceptions
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:31.520]   that you have one box for what you think,
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:33.200]   one box for what you do.
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:35.340]   And what is intervening between those?
[02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:38.280]   Why is it that you can know better and not do better?
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:40.700]   Well, it's because you also have to cope
[02:13:40.700 --> 02:13:43.620]   with the subconscious homeostatic processes
[02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:45.040]   and reward processes.
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:48.500]   And those oftentimes can be disrupted in ways
[02:13:48.500 --> 02:13:51.880]   that we find ourselves doing things that are not good
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:53.260]   for us or not good for other people.
[02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:56.180]   But fortunately there is this great gift,
[02:13:56.180 --> 02:13:58.840]   which is that knowledge of knowledge can allow you
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:01.540]   to do better without question.
[02:14:01.540 --> 02:14:05.520]   And that knowledge of knowledge allowing you to do better
[02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:08.000]   over time leads to this incredible phenomenon
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.740]   called neuroplasticity, which essentially is translated
[02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:14.340]   into doing better over time, even if difficult,
[02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:16.900]   eventually makes doing better reflexive.

[02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:04.660]   that relate to neural circuits, stress,
[02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:06.920]   sleep, and human performance.
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:09.340]   Not today, but oftentimes on this podcast,
[02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:11.500]   we discuss various compounds and supplements
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:13.880]   that people could possibly take
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:18.440]   in order to help deal with anxiety, improve gut microbiome,
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:20.420]   improve their sleep, et cetera.
[02:15:20.420 --> 02:15:21.500]   We didn't discuss those today,
[02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:23.280]   but for those of you interested in those compounds,
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:25.160]   if you want to see the ones that I take,
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:26.980]   you can go to Thorne.
[02:15:26.980 --> 02:15:31.980]   That's T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman.
[02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:35.900]   So it's Thorne.com/u/huberman.
[02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:37.300]   See all the supplements that I take.
[02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:39.580]   You get 20% off any of those supplements.
[02:15:39.580 --> 02:15:41.580]   And if you enter the Thorne site through that portal,
[02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:45.060]   you can get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.
[02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:46.100]   We partnered with Thorne
[02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:48.820]   because they have the highest levels of stringency
[02:15:48.820 --> 02:15:51.280]   with respect to the quality of ingredients,
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:53.660]   the precision of the amounts of those ingredients.
[02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:55.740]   And while supplements are certainly not required
[02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:58.300]   or necessary for anything, really,
[02:15:58.300 --> 02:15:59.620]   you can always use behavioral tools.
[02:15:59.620 --> 02:16:02.160]   Many people benefit from taking supplements of various kinds.
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:03.960]   And we do believe that getting supplements
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:06.100]   of the very highest quality is going to be important
[02:16:06.100 --> 02:16:08.460]   if that's the decision for you.
[02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:10.060]   And last but not least,
[02:16:10.060 --> 02:16:12.460]   I want to thank you for your time and attention
[02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:14.380]   and thank you for your interest in science.
