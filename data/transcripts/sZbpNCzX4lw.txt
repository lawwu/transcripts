[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.160]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.240]   Well, how much jewelry is too much jewelry?
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.920]   It's a question of concern on the podcast
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.320]   because you ask about it.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.980]   And more importantly, it's a question of concern
[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.920]   because it's a topic of concern in the Bible,
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.920]   specifically in 1 Peter 3, 3,
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.800]   a text that has provoked many emails to us over the years
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.880]   on how to limit adornments.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.820]   Here's a representative question I pulled out
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.960]   from a husband and a father.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.500]   Hello, Pastor John, I thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.040]   My wife and I are trying to figure out
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.920]   if it's good to allow our daughter to wear nail polish.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.640]   She's two and loves to play dress up.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.280]   I don't want this to become a necessity,
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.120]   but I suppose it's fine as an expression
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.080]   of her childlike creativity.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.100]   It's ultimately a question for my wife as well.
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.040]   She doesn't wear makeup or jewelry often
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.720]   and I'm happy with that.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.440]   She does however, enjoy having her toes painted
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.920]   and considering 1 Peter 3, verses 3 to 4,
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.400]   I don't know many people who argue
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.160]   that all feminine adornments are bad,
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.040]   but clearly some are wrong.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.880]   So where do we draw that line today?
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.860]   Let me start with a general observation
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.540]   and analogy from the New Testament
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.320]   and then talk about some specifics.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.860]   Consider the analogy between adornment of hair
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.520]   and stylish clothing and use of makeup on the one hand
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.680]   and riches and wealth on the other hand.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.400]   Here's the analogy.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.400]   The New Testament does not call riches and wealth evil
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.280]   in and of themselves,
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.240]   but almost the entire New Testament
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.880]   has the trajectory away from luxury,
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.880]   away from opulence and toward simplicity,
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.280]   toward a kind of wartime lifestyle
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.060]   that is aware of the dangers of money
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.080]   and the appearance of loving this world
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.960]   more than we love God.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.480]   Now then the comparison or the analogy is
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.920]   the Bible does not call fashion or makeup
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.920]   or hairstyling evil in and of itself,
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.160]   but the trajectory of the New Testament
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.920]   is toward simplicity and modesty
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.980]   and inward beauty of character
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.980]   and what you might call on distracting personhood revealing
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.160]   as opposed to body revealing apparel.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.780]   Now that's my general observation.
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.000]   Let's take a few specifics.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.860]   It would be good to put in front of us first, I think,
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.380]   two of the most straightforward texts
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.100]   about women's clothing and adornment
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.040]   and how she presents herself.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.480]   And there are, you can see in these,
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.360]   clear implications for men as well,
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.120]   but they're addressed to women.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.800]   So first, 1 Peter 3, 3 and 4,
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.760]   "Do not let your adorning be external."
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.200]   Saying this to wives who are married to unbelieving husbands
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.920]   probably because the temptation to use
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.640]   their sexual reality
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.080]   to somehow influence this unbelieving husband.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.880]   And he's saying, "Do not let your adorning be external.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.600]   "The braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry,
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.960]   "the clothing that you wear,
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.880]   "but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.040]   "with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit,
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.920]   "which in God's sight is very precious."
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.400]   That's 1 Peter 3.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.900]   Now here's 1 Timothy 2, 9 and 10.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.560]   "I desire that women should adorn themselves
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.560]   "in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control,
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.260]   "not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire,
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.060]   "but with what is proper for women who profess godliness,
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.020]   "that is, with good works."
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.660]   Now, from these two texts, we can say the following.
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.660]   First, "Don't focus more on the external beauty
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.260]   "than the internal beauty."
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.240]   1 Peter, "Do not let your adorning be external,
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.980]   "but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart."
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.380]   So there's the great principle for women,
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.000]   and I would say that's just obviously for men as well.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.100]   Like bodily exercise, you know, that analogy,
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.940]   we like to quote this,
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.400]   "Bodily exercise is of a little value,
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.860]   "but spiritual exercise is of value in every way."
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.220]   And so outward adornment, you could say,
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.860]   is of little value, and internal adornment,
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.260]   that's valuable in every way.
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.640]   So that's the first thing we can infer from those texts.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.420]   And then the second thing is this.
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.420]   Peter's and Paul's restrictions are not meant to be total.
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.780]   And the reason we know that is because right after saying,
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.180]   "Don't let your adorning be the braiding of hair and jewelry,"
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.080]   he says, "Don't let your adorning be
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.220]   "the clothing that you wear."
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.660]   That does not mean don't wear clothing.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.300]   It means don't devote your main efforts
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.780]   and concerns to your clothing, but to inner beauty.
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.900]   So it doesn't mean no jewelry, no hairstyles either.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.340]   Third thing we can say to this is the language of Paul
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.120]   in 1 Timothy 2, 9 and 10 about clothing
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.060]   is almost entirely about what is, quote, "fitting,"
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.060]   or, quote, "becoming," or, quote, "appropriate."
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.460]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.500]   Becoming attire.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.020]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.980]   These are Greek phrases that I made sure I got right.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.900]   With respect for convention or what's fitting.
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.460]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.460]   Not in costly attire, not lavish or gaudy.
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.900]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.980]   As is proper for women who profess godliness.
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.700]   Now, the implication of these guidelines seems to be
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.700]   within an ever-changing, highly corrupt culture,
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.500]   then and now, with fringe elements of grunge
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.340]   and gaudy and provocation,
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.340]   focus on what your clothing and adornment and makeup say
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:40.340]   about you as a person, not you as skin or you as shape.
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.580]   Paul calls this what is proper
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.660]   for women who profess godliness.
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.420]   So now, back to the question about the little girl
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.140]   who wants to paint her nails.
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.580]   Okay, that's where we started.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.740]   Now we're back.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.660]   This brings up the issue,
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.340]   and it's just such a relevant, hot issue,
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.340]   the issue of male and female sexuality and what they are.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.140]   What's the difference between male and female?
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.780]   Which, 20 years ago, we might have felt like,
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.460]   we don't need to talk about that.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.100]   Everybody knows what that is.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.740]   Well, now, we need to be alert to the fact
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.420]   that our little girl should grow up
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.380]   with a happy, thoughtful awareness
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.580]   that God made her a girl and not a boy.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.580]   And our son should grow up with a happy, thoughtful awareness
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.460]   that God made him a boy and not a girl.
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.460]   So I will unashamedly say we should be happy
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.300]   when our daughter, at two years old,
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.700]   wants to paint her nails.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.660]   And our son does not want to paint his nails.
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.180]   And we should affirm her inclination
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.300]   toward this expression of femininity.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.620]   And we should discourage our son's dabbling
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.500]   in this expression of femininity.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.900]   And there are sensitive ways to do that.
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.060]   And I use the term expression of femininity
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.340]   because I'm fully aware that nail polish
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:28.220]   is a cultural expression, not an innate one.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.940]   It's not in her genes that nail polish
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.700]   has to be on her fingernails.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.140]   Girls aren't born with painted nails.
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.900]   But what is innate, God-given innate,
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.420]   is that healthy boys moving toward mature manhood
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.780]   are inclined by God, God-given nature,
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.740]   to embrace culturally appropriate expressions of manhood.
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.260]   And we should help them with this.
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.740]   And healthy girls moving toward mature womanhood
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.300]   are inclined by God-given nature
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:08.060]   to embrace culturally appropriate expressions of womanhood.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.140]   And I believe Paul teaches that very thing
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.940]   in 1 Corinthians 11, five through 16.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.980]   "Does not nature teach you?" he says.
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.860]   And Romans 1, where people are acting against nature.
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.300]   So I would be thankful
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.660]   that my daughter wants to paint her nails.
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.060]   And I would, along with my wife,
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.020]   train her up in how innocent
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:38.500]   and utterly insignificant nail polish is
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:43.500]   in her worth as a person and her influence in the world.
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.380]   We want her to have a worldview
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.740]   so that even if her fingers are all cut off
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.100]   in a machine accident,
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.260]   she would know she can be a beautiful,
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.700]   worthwhile, fruitful person
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.540]   as a believer in Jesus Christ
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.540]   and as the daughter of the King of the universe.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.820]   So besides getting our priorities right
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.460]   and embracing the goodness of maleness and femaleness
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.540]   and dressing in ways that are becoming
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.900]   and fitting our devotion to Christ
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.340]   and dressing in ways that point to our personhood
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.020]   instead of our body
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.300]   and avoiding the arrogance
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.820]   that seeks to defy convention in shocking ways,
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.620]   besides all that,
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.080]   I would add a special concern here
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.180]   that we raise our daughters and sons
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.300]   not to be sexually provocative.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:53.340]   Now that means exposing less skin, not more skin,
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:59.820]   and it means less tight-fitting leggings, shirts.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:04.540]   And if a woman gets upset with me at this point and says,
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.260]   I don't need to calculate my clothing
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.340]   according to male sexual temptation,
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.380]   which is just such a common retort
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.140]   if you try to say anything about modesty these days,
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.780]   but my response to that retort is,
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.100]   well, that's true, that's true.
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:24.300]   You don't have to calculate your clothing that way.
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.120]   You don't.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.340]   But I would ask you this question,
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.700]   which I think women understand
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.260]   who want to embrace feminine beauty and feminine godliness.
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:39.260]   Do you believe that beautiful attractiveness
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.980]   is increased by the amount of skin you expose?
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.400]   Here's my answer.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.000]   The eyes that are drawn to more skin
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.140]   are not drawn to more skin because it's beautiful,
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:01.100]   but because it's more skin, period.
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.260]   More skin is not beauty.
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.740]   It's a magnet.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.220]   Has nothing to do with beauty.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.580]   It has everything to do with pure,
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.900]   physical, magnetizing skin.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.980]   The real test of whether one is beautifully attractive
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.560]   is not how sexy she can be or he can be,
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:26.560]   because sex and beauty are not at all the same.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.580]   And a godly woman knows this.
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.420]   She does not want to be a skin magnet.
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.660]   She wants to say with her clothing,
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.860]   I'm thankful I'm a woman.
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.500]   I love beautiful simplicity,
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.920]   and Christ is my greatest treasure.
