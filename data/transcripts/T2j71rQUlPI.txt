[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.120]   We got a question from Sarah.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.800]   Oh, another parent question.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.080]   Sarah says, do you view raising children
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.960]   as something that can be part of the deep life
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.800]   or something that is mostly an obstacle to the deep life,
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.160]   though valuable in a different way?
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.680]   So Sarah, when I think about the deep life,
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.560]   as you know from the show, I often
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.640]   think it's useful to break up the aspects of your life
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.480]   in the different areas that, for historical reasons
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.900]   on this show, we call buckets, even though that might not
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.200]   be the best terminology.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.760]   And what you really want to make sure
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.000]   is that in each of these buckets, each of these areas
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.160]   that's important, you're putting energy, real energy,
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.880]   into things that are really important, things
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.620]   that are really important in that bucket,
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.440]   and not wasting too much energy on things that are not.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.760]   One of those buckets that's probably, I would say,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.440]   the most important bucket is what I often call community.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.680]   But community is family, friends,
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.240]   and the people around you.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.840]   That's the key one.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.840]   I mean, I've said this before on the show.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.840]   If you neglect that one, the other ones don't matter.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.880]   You might be OK for a while neglecting
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.000]   what's in that community bucket, neglecting family,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.220]   neglecting friends, neglecting the people around you,
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.200]   but you have no resilience.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.240]   And when you hit hard times, that bottom is going to fall,
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.480]   and you are going to plummet.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.960]   Homo sapiens are very social beings,
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.760]   sacrificing on behalf, time and energy on behalf of others
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.960]   that are important to us is at the absolute foundation
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.200]   to living a deep life.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.160]   So no, it's not an obstacle to a deep life.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.320]   It's a bucket you have to take care of first
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.320]   before you think about the craft bucket, for example,
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.120]   where your work might be, or before you
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.280]   think about the constitution bucket, where
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.680]   exercise and fitness and health might be, for example.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.000]   Now, the reason why I think this is an important question
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.640]   is you know that.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.680]   So I think the issue is there's a semantic thing
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.200]   we should clarify.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.320]   So when you say valuable in a different way,
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.520]   I think what's happening here is that you are defining
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.160]   the deep life too narrowly.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.000]   You're probably thinking of the deep life
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.160]   as meaning I do deep work in my job.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.400]   And so a deep life does a lot of that.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.280]   And anything else that gets in the way of that
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.800]   is an obstacle to that.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.080]   That is not the deep life.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.320]   And this is why I actually introduced
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.120]   the notion of the deep life, which I coined
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.320]   the term in March of 2020.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.880]   The historians among you will look at your calendars
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.360]   and realize there were some important things happening
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.280]   during that month.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.280]   And the whole point of actually coining
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.800]   the term the deep life and starting
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.200]   that thinking in March of 2020 was
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.440]   to make sure that we were considering the whole picture
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.720]   of what matters in life.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.760]   That was a time period, at least that month,
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.360]   where people did not care much about exactly how much deep work
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.480]   they were doing on their job.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.840]   Because if you're in the type of job that you do deep work,
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.000]   what you really were doing was being on Zoom all day
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.600]   and just panicking.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.920]   So it was a time period where we said, OK, the whole life
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.920]   matters, this disruption makes that clear.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.080]   If you do not have all of the buckets firing what
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.480]   happens when there's huge disruption,
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.880]   your bottom falls out.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.440]   You plummet.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.960]   We don't want that to happen again.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.400]   All parts of the deep life matter.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.200]   So no, your kids are critical to it.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.440]   My whole professional life is built in part
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   around making sure that that bucket of my deep life
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.440]   is serviced.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.520]   It's why I do the work I do.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.600]   It's why I really prioritize.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.280]   And I built my entire career trajectory
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.560]   around this, autonomy and flexibility,
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.200]   control over my time.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.640]   I want to be on the short scale.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.840]   I want to be able to, though I can't do it every day,
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.200]   have days where I'm just take the whole afternoon off
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.680]   and I pick the kids up and spend time with them.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.760]   I want to be able to take them to their practices.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.520]   On the bigger scale, I want to take summers really quietly.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.920]   I want to just be around.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.560]   I want to have long breaks.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.200]   The academic life gives you long breaks.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.280]   The writing life gives you full autonomy.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.240]   I'm really big on having huge flexibility and seasonality,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.640]   busy periods and not busy periods,
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.960]   so I can be around and deeply ingrained in my kids' life.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.120]   We decided where we moved.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.520]   We're in Tacoma Park because a family is the right place
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.800]   to raise a family, et cetera.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.360]   So Sarah, that's all to say, no, your kids
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.520]   are key to your definition of the deep life.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.240]   But you've got to look at all the buckets
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.960]   and then come up with a configuration of life
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.000]   that serves all of them.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
