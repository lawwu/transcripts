[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]   It wasn't just a one-on-one,
[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.480]   but could be Steve against the team going,
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.800]   we need glass instead of plastic
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.600]   on the front face of the iPhone,
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.000]   and we're going to do this.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.480]   And we're like, God, you know?
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.000]   And so we did it.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   And he pushed us because he didn't know all the details,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.480]   but he could see in our minds that we're like,
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.040]   yeah, we could probably, yeah, we could probably,
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.080]   but man, it's really putting us in risk.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.040]   And we laid out the risks for him.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.320]   And he's like, I'm willing to take those risks.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.160]   - The following is a conversation with Tony Fadell,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.000]   engineer and designer, co-creator of the iPod,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.440]   the iPhone, and the Nest thermostat.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.200]   And he's the author of the new book,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.200]   "Build, An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making."
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.080]   More than almost any human ever,
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.940]   he knows what it takes to create technology ideas,
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.280]   designs, products, and companies that revolutionize life
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.080]   for huge numbers of people in the world.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.860]   So it truly is an honor and pleasure
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.680]   to sit down with Tony for a time
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.480]   and look back at one heck of an amazing life.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.460]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.420]   To support it,
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.940]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.000]   And now, dear friends, here's Tony Fadell.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.220]   When did you first fall in love with computers,
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.540]   or let's say computer engineering and design?
[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.540]   - I first fell in love with computers and programming.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.780]   Was it a summer school class?
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.540]   In fifth grade in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan.
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.580]   It was a simple basic programming class,
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.140]   but the basic programming class
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.700]   was not like you might think it was.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.100]   It was bubble cards.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.940]   So literally it was, you know,
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.860]   the cards, the stack of cards,
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.080]   and you would use a number two pencil,
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.940]   and you would put in your program line by line,
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.940]   and you'd have to make sure it was perfectly stacked
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.380]   with no errors and what have you.
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.960]   And you'd take that set of cards
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.180]   and you'd put it on this reader,
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.780]   and it was (imitates buzzing)
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.700]   and it would go off to an IBM microcomputer
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.700]   somewhere in the, back then, the cloud.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.180]   (laughing)
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.540]   And then you would sit on a Texas Instruments
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.700]   paper terminal, and it would just,
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.020]   literally, I was just, I could write things,
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.680]   and I could program this machine to do stuff.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.900]   And it was, you know, it was nowhere near sexy.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.580]   There was no graphics, right?
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.140]   Oregon Trail was all in text, right?
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.940]   The cards were so cumbersome
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.860]   that if you got one thing wrong or out of order,
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.860]   or a disaster, or you dropped one card,
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.500]   it would all fall apart.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.180]   So just doing that, you know, printf,
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.060]   or what was it?
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.460]   I can't even remember what it was.
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.900]   It was, you know, what the basic commands were, but--
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.780]   - Oh, so when you say basic, you mean basic programming?
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.700]   - Programming language.
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.420]   - Okay. - Basic programming.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.460]   - You're writing basic programming language on paper.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.580]   - On paper.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.100]   - And you're calling it programming, though.
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.220]   It's called programming.
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.980]   - Yeah, you're programming this computer
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.260]   in a remote location, and it came back.
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.660]   So it was truly cloud computing, in a way.
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.340]   It was really terminal-based computing.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.100]   - And the input and the program are separate?
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.040]   So the input to the program, or they go together?
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.340]   Or there's no input to the program?
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.300]   It just runs, and it gives you output?
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.980]   - Yeah, it goes in, and it says ready,
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.660]   and then you can say run.
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.220]   And then it would run, but to program it,
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.460]   you didn't type it, 'cause it was a printer terminal.
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.820]   You would make the stack of cards,
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.780]   and that would get it into the computer's memory.
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.960]   - Okay, so where was the magic?
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.700]   - The magic was that you could create,
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.340]   you had a language, and you could create
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.780]   what you wanted to create, right?
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.060]   You could create a world, or what have you,
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.660]   and have this interaction.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.060]   And you could compute things, you could do numbers.
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.980]   I was playing Oregon Trail, right?
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.820]   So you were less like--
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.740]   - So you can play video games?
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.660]   - Well, video. (laughs)
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.900]   - Right, without the video.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.220]   - You could play text games,
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.420]   and then imagine 'em in your brain, right?
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.100]   - Oregon Trail, there's this meme I saw recently.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.780]   If you wanna feel bad about yourself as a programmer,
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.420]   realize that one person wrote Railroad Tycoon.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.780]   I think that's the name of the game.
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.220]   It's this cool little builder game.
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.900]   One person wrote it in assembly.
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.540]   (both laugh)
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.300]   So from scratch, and for people who don't know,
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.580]   it kinda looks like a SimCity-type game.
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.060]   It's a city builder, but obviously centered on railroads.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.940]   And there's a nice graphics, it's three-dimensional,
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.980]   all that kinda stuff.
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.940]   All the things, all the rich, colorful things
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.780]   you would imagine for a three-dimensional video game,
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.340]   all written in assembly, meaning the lowest level code
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.100]   next to binary, which is fascinating.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.460]   And you had to notice the magic
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.620]   at that low level at that time.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.100]   You didn't have all the graphics,
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.020]   you didn't have all the APIs and all the sample codes,
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.380]   no stack overflow, no internet, none of that.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.340]   - You just had, you had to know registers,
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.220]   you had to know the opcodes,
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.420]   and you had to imagine the world in your brain,
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.100]   the memory structures and everything.
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.220]   There's no visualization.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.380]   You visualized it all yourself, right?
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.980]   And so that was magic, but then the next part of the magic
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.340]   of where I got hooked even further,
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.300]   was like, I'm doing these little things.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.500]   And then electronic arts came out for the Apple II.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.220]   So I got an Apple II, and electronic arts came out,
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.940]   and I was programming and doing basic
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.740]   and making my own games.
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.380]   But then there were two games that really blew my mind.
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.140]   One was pinball construction set,
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.780]   and the other one was music construction set.
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.060]   And these were both places
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.980]   where I could create pinball games,
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.180]   and I could create musical scores, 'cause I love music,
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.300]   and I could then play them, right?
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.860]   And so when you had that, you were like,
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.380]   oh, this is something very different.
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.220]   So I could create myself,
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.580]   but then there was others that create tools
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.180]   so you could create at a visual level.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.740]   And then you would read the backstories,
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.700]   'cause electronics arts back in the day,
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.740]   it was one programmer who would program those things,
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.740]   you know, each of those things.
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.140]   And you could read their backstories.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.180]   It was literally like a musician or someone else,
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.500]   like you could read Rick Rubin's, like, here's the thing.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.780]   They tell you all that stuff.
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.780]   And there was one guy who wrote music construction set.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.940]   He wrote it all in assembly, and he was 16 years old.
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.900]   And I was probably 12 or 13 at the time.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.020]   And I went, oh my, if he was able to do this
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.700]   and had published, right,
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.620]   and this amazing tool was created,
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.740]   I'm like, what could I do?
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.580]   And so then it just kept building off of that.
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.500]   But really it was those seminal things,
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.500]   first the introduction,
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.300]   and then the power through programming
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.460]   and turning these things into what you wanted
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.740]   to turn it into.
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.900]   And you didn't have to be 40, 50 years old
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.420]   and have PhDs.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.660]   And then I was like, okay, this is really cool.
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.980]   - I wish we did that with programmers
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.500]   where we treated them like artists.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.260]   We would know the backstory these days, today.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.540]   Or we'd, not just programmers, engineers.
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.020]   - Engineers, designers.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.340]   - Yeah, like all the things about a product
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.380]   that I think we love are the little details
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.100]   and there's probably a human being
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.820]   behind each of those details
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.460]   that had their little inkling of genius that they put in.
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.020]   I wish we knew those stories.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.660]   That's always sad to me when I,
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.100]   'cause obviously I love engineering
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.180]   and I interact with companies and they,
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.900]   you know, autonomous vehicles,
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.100]   something I'm really interested about.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.740]   And I see that companies generally,
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.060]   and we'll probably talk about this,
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.460]   but they seem to want to hide their engineers.
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.740]   Like engineers hold the secrets,
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.580]   like the great secret.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.060]   We do not speak of the great secret.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.860]   But then the result of that is you don't,
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.300]   you don't get to hear their stories.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.140]   The passion that is there behind the engineers,
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.060]   like, and also the genius, the little,
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.540]   there's a difference between the stuff that's patented,
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.740]   like the kernel of the idea
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.540]   and the beautiful sort of side effects of the idea.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.180]   And I wish companies revealed the beautiful side effects
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.780]   a little bit more.
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.380]   But, so sorry for the distraction.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.740]   So what, you mentioned Apple II.
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.660]   What was the first computer you fell in love with?
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.380]   Like the product, the thing before you
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.620]   that was a personal computer?
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.180]   - It was the Apple II.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.940]   So the Apple II was something I was just lusting over.
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.380]   You know, it was, I think it was at the time,
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.980]   it was the, you know, the person of the year.
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.940]   Maybe it was that year, I don't remember what, but.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.860]   - Well, Apple II was the person of the year?
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.700]   - Yeah, for "Mind" magazine back in, I don't remember when,
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.980]   but it was around that same time I was so young,
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.620]   but I had, there was the Apple II
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.060]   and I didn't know what it was, but I knew about tools
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.780]   'cause my grandfather taught me all about tools
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.820]   and creating things, right?
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.500]   And I saw this thing and I had the, you know,
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.220]   that IBM experience, that terminal experience.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.580]   And I'm like, oh, I could have that at home, right?
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.060]   And so I need to have that at home.
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.900]   And the only thing that was really talked about
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.980]   in our circles was the Apple II.
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.900]   And I was just like, that's it.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.580]   So I went, jumped up and down, it was very expensive.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.460]   I have to have this, my parents were like, what?
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.140]   You know, it was $2,500 back then.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.980]   In 1981, it was like crazy, right?
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.980]   So I was like, I'm gonna make as much money
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.900]   as I can this summer.
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.800]   And my grandfather said, 'cause he helped me learn
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.100]   all about tools and build things together,
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.220]   I will match whatever you make so you can get this computer.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.620]   So I worked very, very hard as a caddy, golf caddy.
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.620]   Cadding actually for the, you know, the families in,
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.980]   you know, at the country clubs in the town where we lived.
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.460]   And did whatever I could.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.380]   And that end of that summer, we got my Apple II.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.260]   And you couldn't tear it away from me.
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.740]   It was my friend, it was everything.
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.660]   - From a product perspective,
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.940]   what do you remember that was brilliant?
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.140]   The design choices, the ideas behind it,
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.780]   or is it just that it exists?
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.180]   Or the very idea of a personal computer
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.180]   is the brilliant design choice?
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.060]   - Yeah, it was that I could actually have this kind of tool
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.980]   in my house and I could use it anytime I wanted.
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.340]   I could program it any ways.
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.740]   There was no, you know, there was no internet connection.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.860]   There was no, it was all just you.
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.700]   You either loaded software that you got from someone, right?
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.220]   Or you created it yourself.
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.780]   And then there was the whole other thing
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.420]   which was started happening, which we were doing,
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.380]   and this was kind of like MP3s and stuff.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.220]   We were sharing software, right?
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.020]   So you built this community of sharing software.
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.780]   You would go and pirate,
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.820]   that was what it was called, pirate all this software.
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.940]   You'd never use it all, but it was just that fun thing
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.820]   of like, I'm gonna get all this other stuff
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.140]   and then tear it apart and do disassembly on it
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.660]   and see behind the scenes.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.620]   So you really had a sense this was your world
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.140]   and you owned it, right?
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.580]   And you could like literally go into every register.
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.620]   We didn't have all those security layers like we do now.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.620]   Like you could really touch bits and you could poke bits
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.260]   and you could make this light turn on.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.780]   And you know, and the Geek & Simon just lit up.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.260]   Now it's so abstract, you know,
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.580]   people don't even understand, like usually, you know,
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.100]   some programs don't even understand memory.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.780]   They just think it's unlimited, right?
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.700]   - Yeah, and security.
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.060]   It's like now there's all this security that you should have
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.140]   but it's like the adults all showed up to the party
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.060]   and now you can't have all the fun.
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.700]   - Right, it's like, no, no.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.380]   You know, this was the thing where if the power went out,
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.580]   you lost your whole program.
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.940]   You might've worked a whole day on it.
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.740]   And if you didn't press save at every other line
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.340]   and you were to save, save, save,
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.620]   and it would like, grr, grr, the disk drive
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.060]   or the tape drive, grr, grr, grr.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.620]   Like every single step was contemplated
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.220]   because if you didn't, you lost maybe a ton of work.
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.500]   - So a lot of the magic was in the software.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.900]   The fact that you could have software,
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.940]   the fact that you could share software,
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.820]   the community around the software,
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.500]   it wasn't necessarily the hardware.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.740]   - Well, that was the first step.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.780]   The second step around the hardware
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.220]   was I got things like the Mockingboard,
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.980]   which the Mockingboard paired with the music instruction set
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.300]   you could now generate all kinds of tones and notes.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.060]   And it was a synthesizer in the Apple II.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.980]   So you would plug in this card and you go,
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.020]   oh my God, look at this.
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.260]   And it would, you know,
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.500]   you could start generating cool sounds.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.900]   You're like, it like it was a Moog, you know,
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.260]   like a Moog in a way, early Moog.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.700]   - What year are we talking about?
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.780]   - This is '82, I think, '81, '82.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.460]   - And I bet you can make all the kind of synthetic sounds
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.220]   that are very cool in the '80s.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.620]   - Yeah, the eight bit, you know, chip tunes, right?
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.500]   Chip tune, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.940]   And then, you know, when you wanted to add a joystick,
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.100]   you had to pull a chip out
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.140]   and you had to like plug in a dip socket
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.220]   to put in a joystick.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.900]   And then I was like, oh, and then I had to get more memory.
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:45.820]   How do we do that?
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.340]   And I wanted to speed up product.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:51.900]   So then that turned into a company actually from that,
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.620]   but it was in a hardware software, no one had that.
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.900]   But it was all about, you know,
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.380]   modifying this thing in every way.
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.500]   First was software,
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.140]   and then you started gaining confidence.
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.860]   And then I got a little bit more money and stuff,
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.220]   and then you could get into the hardware and, you know,
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.100]   wire things.
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:09.220]   And then the Apple II came with all the schematics, right?
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.500]   So in the back, in the early Apple IIs,
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.860]   you could open up and all the schematics were there.
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.540]   - So you purchased the Apple II
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.980]   and the schematics come with it.
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.540]   - Yeah, it came with it.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.340]   - That's an interesting choice.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.980]   That's an interesting choice from a company perspective.
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:25.820]   - Right? - So interesting.
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.580]   - It's a real maker kind of thing.
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.420]   - Right.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.740]   Ah, I wonder what they, so that was intentional.
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.180]   Like this is-- - Absolutely intentional.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.340]   - This is for the cutting edge folks too,
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.180]   or especially for the cutting edge.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.180]   - It was only the cutting edge.
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.380]   It was geeks for geeks.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.140]   So we were like, oh, how did they make it?
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.500]   And then we got to learn through that.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.340]   Apple I did the same thing, right?
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.620]   It just, Apple II became more packaged up
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.020]   and had, you know, a little bit better software, right?
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.300]   Came with basic and then, you know, so it was really,
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.580]   it was what we might think of as a raspberry pie today
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.780]   or something like that, but not with so much software.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.860]   It was literally, and all the chips were out there
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.020]   so you could inspect the buses and the, right?
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.260]   'Cause everything was just broken out.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.980]   - So I guess that's the idea behind stable,
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.820]   big projects in open source, like on GitHub.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.180]   That you have the schematics there
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.460]   and it's kind of a product,
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.580]   but I wonder why more companies don't do that kind of thing.
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.460]   Like we're going to release this
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:31.700]   to a small set of people, self-selected perhaps,
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.140]   that are kind of the makers, the cutting edge folks,
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.620]   the builders, the at-home engineers.
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:43.540]   Like in some way, what Tesla is doing with the beta
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.460]   for the full self-driving is kind of like that.
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.940]   It's like selecting a group of people,
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.620]   but that has to do more with you,
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.100]   how safe of a driver you are
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.380]   versus how much of a tinkerer you are
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.820]   because you don't get to tinker.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.220]   I wonder, is that a crazy idea
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.940]   to do for really cutting edge technologies?
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.460]   Especially you're interested in like hardware stuff.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.820]   Is that crazy?
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.180]   Why don't more companies do that kind of thing, you think?
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.540]   - I think back then it was about a community
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.740]   and serving that community of builders.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.100]   Now this is about people who want to get the experience
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.740]   and want it really simple and easy.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:24.380]   And they're like, and so there's the audience
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.140]   or they believe the audience is small
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:27.700]   who would value those other things
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.060]   that we're just talking about.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.940]   But if we look at things like Raspberry Pi
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.700]   and all of these other little boards, right,
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.820]   there's a whole world more than I've seen.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.060]   Like it's amazing what you can do now with these little kits
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.540]   and the software that's created.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.180]   And so there's a whole nother,
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.540]   I think another batch of makers and builders
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.060]   that are coming up through the ranks.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.660]   And if we look at YouTube channels and stuff, right,
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.220]   they take these little boards, they hack them,
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.660]   then they print out parts on their 3D printer,
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.460]   assemble them and they create robots and what have you.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.900]   So I think it's happening.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:06.900]   It's just not as, I guess, raw as it used to be.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.860]   But it's there and it's really expanding around the world.
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.260]   And that's really nice to see
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.580]   'cause it's a whole new generation who are empowered.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.220]   I think there's a semi-dormant genius amongst millions.
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.540]   So like Raspberry Pi is revealing that a little bit.
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.060]   It's probably, I wouldn't be surprised
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.300]   if it's several million Raspberry Pis
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.580]   that have been sold and shipped.
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:36.340]   And it's kind of this quiet storm of genius,
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.540]   brewing of engineers.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.980]   We don't get to hear it because they're not organized.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.260]   I mean, we get to hear it through inklings here and there.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.700]   Like I said, YouTube, there's little communities
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.700]   that are local and so on.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.740]   But if they were organized,
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.860]   (both laughing)
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.740]   if a leader would emerge, no.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.980]   Okay, so when did you first start to dream
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.540]   about building your own things,
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.300]   designing your own products,
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.100]   designing your own systems and software and hardware?
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.060]   - Well, in high school, there was a company
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.540]   that a friend of mine founded and I was the second employee.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.660]   It was called Quality Computers.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.220]   And it was a mail order,
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.380]   'cause there's no e-commerce then.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.740]   There was no internet again.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.580]   You either mailed in your little coupon
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.300]   and you said, "This is what I wanted to order,"
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.780]   or you wrote in to get a catalog and delivered to you.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.780]   Turnaround time in this stuff was like,
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.540]   from the time you wanted to the time you bought it
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.540]   was maybe eight to 12 weeks.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.380]   That was just the normal way of getting things.
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.380]   So Quality Computers was a mail order for Apple II.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.540]   And it was software and all kinds of accessories.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.060]   So hardware accessories, so hardware,
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.620]   plug-in cards, joysticks, all this stuff.
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.180]   And what we noticed was there were
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.620]   accelerators and memory cards.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.620]   And to be able to use those cards,
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.740]   you had to actually go and change the software you used
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.420]   to access this new memory.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.940]   So you literally have to go and you took the program
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.300]   that you had, let's say it was Apple Works,
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.300]   which was like an early Microsoft Office
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.460]   or something like that.
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.060]   And you had to literally change the code
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.020]   and you would install these patches
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.380]   to then take advantage of the hardware.
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.540]   So what we started creating was software on top of it
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.780]   to do the automatic installation of all of these patches.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.340]   So we made it much easier to take new hardware
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.340]   and the existing software you have
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.340]   and expand it into this new world.
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.500]   So it was creating tools
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.300]   and the really great customer support.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.940]   And we started getting a lot of orders
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.540]   'cause we had the software make it easier to install
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.460]   to give them the superpower.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.100]   And at the same time,
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.780]   they would be able to change their software
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.140]   and have a new world that wasn't existing
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.420]   from the companies that were creating the initial products.
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.980]   And so it was more of that.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.740]   And then that happened with hard drives.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.620]   So I wrote a hard drive optimizer for the Apple II
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.380]   to like read, 'cause you could get really fragmented.
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.820]   So I wrote that piece of software
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.100]   and we sold that through the company
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.940]   along with the hard drives that we sold from third parties.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:17.180]   So that all happened in 12th grade,
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.700]   freshman year of college.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:23.140]   - You wrote a hard drive optimizer in 12th grade
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.540]   for the Apple II.
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.700]   - Between 12th and freshman year.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.020]   - What programming language?
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.100]   Do you remember, is it assemblies?
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.060]   - There were certain inner loops were assembly
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.260]   and other loops, actually there were really early Pascal,
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.540]   no, C compilers.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.420]   - What was the motivation behind these?
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.780]   Is it to make people's lives easier?
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.660]   Is it to create a thing experience
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.780]   that is simpler and simpler and simpler,
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.060]   thereby more accessible to a larger number of people?
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.900]   Or did you just like to tinker?
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.380]   - No, no, no, it was two things really.
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.460]   'Cause one, we wanted to sell more hardware
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.620]   and software, right?
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.900]   So it was like, oh, make it easier for the user.
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.020]   And then the other thing was,
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.660]   because I was also manning the customer support line,
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.580]   people would call and I'd go, this doesn't work.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.100]   And I'm like, oh, I gotta go fix the hardware and software.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.740]   I gotta fix the software to make the hardware
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.300]   and the installation process better.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.860]   So my whole world was out of box experience
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.380]   from when I was in high school.
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.460]   'Cause I had to man the customer support line,
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.820]   pack the boxes and write some of the code
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.140]   while we were doing, while Joe, Joe Gleason,
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.940]   who was the founder of Quality Computers,
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.020]   he was off doing the mark, the ads,
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.220]   placing the ads for the mail order,
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.780]   making sure we were running the credit cards, right?
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.180]   It was two of us and then it turned into a third,
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.940]   and then we hired another person from high school
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.700]   to like pack boxes so I could stay
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.540]   on the customer support line or doing the software, right?
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.660]   And it was all in his parents' basement, right?
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.260]   - As you were scaling exponentially.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.660]   - Scaling, right, exactly, bootstrapping.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.380]   - So we'll jump around a little bit,
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.460]   but what were the, you said you love music.
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.700]   What were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.060]   if we jump forward?
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:05.740]   And how far back do those ideas stretch?
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.580]   - If you look at the history of technology,
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:14.580]   there's, I mean, not just the product,
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.940]   but the idea is truly revolutionary.
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.200]   Maybe its time has come,
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.740]   but just if you look at the arc of history,
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:30.740]   sort of music is so fundamental to who we are as a humanity,
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:34.100]   and to be able to put that in your pocket,
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.540]   make it truly portable is fascinating
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.140]   in a way that's truly portable.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.980]   So it's digital as opposed to sort of like a Walkman
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.100]   or something like that.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.700]   So what were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod?
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.020]   - You know, I was in love with music since I was a kid.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.740]   Just loved music from, I think, second grade
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.140]   when I got my first albums and stuff like that.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.660]   - What kind of music are we talking about?
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.980]   - So this was Led Zeppelin.
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:08.300]   This was the Stones, Hendrix, Aerosmith,
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:13.780]   Cheap Trick, Styx, Ted Nugent,
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.860]   you know, just the real American,
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.180]   and British rock and roll, right?
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.580]   - There's a bunch of people listening right now.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.100]   Who, Ted, who's that?
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.300]   - Who's that? - Led Zeppelin?
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.140]   What is that?
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.300]   Is that who you? - Oh, yeah.
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.900]   (laughing)
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.460]   It drove my parents crazy.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.700]   - Yeah, you just blasted loud.
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.620]   - Loud, just, and this was
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.100]   second, third grade, fourth grade.
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.180]   I just, it fell in love.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:40.540]   And then we moved back to Detroit,
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.060]   and I loved listening to the radio station
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.980]   'cause there was all kinds of crazy music
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.780]   'cause you'd have an amalgam of rock and then funk and R&B,
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.380]   and I loved to listen at night.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.740]   So I had a clock radio.
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.580]   But if I had the clock radio on,
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.780]   parents would go, "Go to sleep, stop that,
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.820]   "turn that stuff off."
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.260]   So I hacked the clock radio and put a headphone jack in it.
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.740]   - Nice.
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.820]   - Right, so I'd say, "Oh, there, wow,"
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.220]   okay, and then I could listen to it all night,
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.420]   and no one could hear me, right?
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.300]   And I could just sit there and, you know.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.900]   - Just huddling around the radio.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.740]   - Groove out.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.580]   - Just listening to Zeppelin, "Stairway to Heaven."
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.860]   What would you say is the greatest rock,
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.060]   classic rock song of all time?
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.500]   - Greatest classic rock song of all time?
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.540]   - What pops into mind?
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.700]   Well, no, you know what?
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.540]   I mean, this has to be objectively number one.
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.940]   - That's really hard, dude.
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.220]   This is so hard. - No, you have to.
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.580]   This is a serious journalistic interview.
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.060]   You're not going to back down from these kinds of questions.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:37.900]   - Oh my God.
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.300]   - No, I don't know. - It's a challenge.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.860]   - Yeah, it's hard to pick,
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:45.660]   but to me, "Stairway to Heaven" is a safe fall.
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.020]   It's so often considered to be one of the greatest songs
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.700]   of all time that you almost don't wanna pick it.
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:52.540]   - Right, exactly.
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.460]   - But you've returned to it time and time again,
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.100]   and it's like, yeah, this is something pretty special.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.720]   This is a rock opera of sorts.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.140]   - Well, the rock opera that really blew me away
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.700]   and still continues to blow me away
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.260]   is all of "Dark Side of the Moon."
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.980]   Like that, I love Zeppelin.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.120]   I can't say which one's better,
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.900]   but "Dark Side of the Moon" for me,
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.820]   it was a audio experience, right?
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.200]   The whole thing from soup to nuts,
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.340]   plus all the synthesizers, all of those things.
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.780]   - Okay, so back to the iPod.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.500]   So from the early age, you loved music.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.380]   - Loved it, absolutely loved it,
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.500]   and always was just around it
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.180]   and it was always playing.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.780]   I played it so loud that I actually hurt the earring
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.580]   in my right ear, and I still suffer from that today.
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.700]   And then-- - No regrets.
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.060]   - No regrets whatsoever, going to concerts
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.260]   in downtown Detroit and all that crazy stuff.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:53.260]   So moving forward, so in college, I was a DJ.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:58.660]   So I would DJ and hang out and play all the tunes I love
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.780]   and whatever for the crowd, and then I continued
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:06.740]   to do that in Silicon Valley when I moved right after school
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.220]   and so I was belugging all of these CDs around with me,
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.300]   a thousand CDs, right?
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:16.740]   And at the same time, and so those were heavy,
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.300]   and at the same time, I was doing the Philips Nino and Velo.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.960]   Those are Windows CE-based mobile computing products.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.900]   Nino was the first device to actually put audible books
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.420]   on tape, so I worked with Audible, we met in a conference,
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.060]   and they were like, "We don't wanna do hardware,
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.180]   "we just wanna do content."
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.820]   I was like, "Well, we have this device,
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.100]   "let's get it together," and we got Audible on that,
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:46.100]   and this was in '96 or '97, first Audible books.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.340]   And it, you know, I was like, "Oh my God, that's audio.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.820]   "Well, what if we put music on it?"
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.940]   Right, and so, and the memory was very small at the time,
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.580]   right, there was almost no flash, it was all DRAM.
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.780]   When you did Audible, you stored it in DRAM.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.540]   (laughing)
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.380]   Right?
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:08.380]   - Which is okay, probably, 'cause how much books do you need
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.980]   is the idea.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.980]   By the way, brilliant, I mean, just putting books,
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.660]   I know it's probably not the sexiest of things,
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:20.660]   but putting books on a mobile device is a brilliant step.
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.420]   I don't know, sometimes you can't measure
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:29.180]   how much human progress occurred because of an invention.
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.100]   Like, there's the sexy big products, but you never know.
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.420]   Like, Wikipedia is one of those things
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.380]   that doesn't get enough, I think, credit
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.740]   for the transformational effects it has.
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.220]   It's not seen as the sexiest of products, but maybe it is.
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.860]   When you look at human history, Wikipedia,
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.700]   arguably, is one of the big things
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:52.700]   that basically unlocked human knowledge.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.700]   - Human knowledge, and human editing,
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:59.500]   and just the human nature of building something together.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.540]   - Yeah, so it's fascinating.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.980]   Sometimes you can't measure those things,
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.940]   maybe until many, many decades later.
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:09.220]   Anyway, sorry, so that was there,
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.780]   and then there was Audible, you put books,
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.340]   why not put music?
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.460]   - Music, and I'm carrying around the music
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.100]   for the DJ gigs, and you're like, wait a second,
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.900]   two and two together, right?
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.100]   Let's get rid of this, and then MP3s show up.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.500]   - The actual encoded-- - The format.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.180]   MP3s showed up around '97, '98.
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:33.180]   - So MP3s is compressed so you can have,
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.780]   like, the storage is reduced significantly.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.820]   - Right, so you could go from a large, full,
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:43.820]   full lossless digital track into something
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.660]   that can be stored in four to eight megabytes,
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.100]   something like that for the audio.
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.220]   Now, that's a reduced quality,
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.300]   but you could get it down there,
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.020]   and you're like, oh, okay.
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.460]   And now, if we have enough flash or DRAM,
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.020]   we can put 10, 15, what have you,
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:02.740]   all in that same memory, and it starts to replicate a CD,
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.020]   and then ultimately, if you put it on a hard drive,
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.700]   you could start to put thousands of songs.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.140]   - Yeah, that's also another brilliant invention.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.820]   But people don't realize, I think people would be surprised
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.700]   how big, in terms of storage, raw audio is.
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.500]   And the fact that you can compress it, like,
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.980]   I don't know what the compression is,
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.780]   but it's like 10X, it's very significant compression,
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.660]   and still, it sounds almost lossless.
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.660]   - Much to the chagrin of Neil Young,
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.820]   who does not like that.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.340]   - But even Neil Young, even the stuff he talks about
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.660]   is still tiny files relative to the raw.
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.660]   So he wants us to increase it just a little bit more,
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.780]   a little bit more.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.860]   But it's still, that's an invention.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.420]   That's a thing that unlocks your ability
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.340]   to carry around a device like a Nino and listen to music,
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.500]   'cause without that, there's no way you can carry it
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.300]   on a gigantic hard drive.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.420]   - Right, exactly.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.260]   And so, so then, that, so it was MP3s, the Nino,
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:05.780]   and my hatred of carrying around all this heavy stuff
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:10.780]   that then spawned Fuse, and then ultimately,
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.660]   became a lot of that, the ideas and things of that nature,
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.060]   and my passions were born into then the iPod.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.500]   You know, it was too, Apple needed something,
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.700]   and I wanted to fix something, and it all kinda,
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.140]   you know, came together at the right place, right time,
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.060]   plus the right technology came at this.
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.420]   It was just like the stars aligned.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.500]   - So how did it come to life,
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.100]   the details of the stars aligning,
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.340]   but the actual design, the actual engineering
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.900]   of getting a device to be small,
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:47.900]   the storage, the interface, how it looks,
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.420]   the storage, the details of the software,
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.460]   all that kinda stuff.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.740]   What are some interesting memories
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.020]   from that design process?
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.340]   What are some wisdoms you can--
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.460]   (laughing)
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.220]   - Art, from that process.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.740]   - Well, you know, how long do you wanna go?
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.540]   'Cause I have, I can go deep, so--
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.780]   - Let's go at least 20 hours, let's go--
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:12.620]   - Okay, 20 hours.
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.860]   - This is one of the lengthy documentaries
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:15.700]   that make it happen. - We're gonna turn it
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.820]   into episodic binge listening. - On Netflix.
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.140]   Yeah, Game of Thrones.
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.100]   - So let's just start with, you know,
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.660]   after I was asked to be a consultant
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.380]   to put this thing together.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.420]   So I already had knowledge of, you know,
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.060]   the space and the technology and all that stuff,
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.700]   but I had to very quickly, and a lot of the suppliers,
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.100]   because of what I was doing at Fuse,
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.500]   trying to create that thing.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.180]   And as a contractor, I was like,
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.660]   okay, what is the first thing you need to do?
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:48.540]   So after I showed a, you know, different architectures
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.780]   and what three different products could be
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.780]   to Steve about options for storage options,
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.300]   battery options, form factor options,
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.740]   there was three options.
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:02.060]   And as I was told, given very good advice,
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.540]   give to the two options you really do not like,
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.540]   but they're options, and give the best option last,
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.500]   'cause Steve will shoot all those down
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.500]   and give the best option last,
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.860]   and then you could talk about that.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:16.860]   And so that was the one that had a 1.8 inch hard drive
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:23.820]   and a small screen, like the screen you know it,
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.820]   on the original iPod, classic iPod.
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.660]   And then I had enough of the idea
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:34.660]   of the three or four different CPUs and processor suppliers
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.780]   and kind of systems that were out there
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.100]   that I had gone and found and put together
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.780]   on power supplies, you know, disk drive interfaces,
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.460]   firewire interface, all that stuff.
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.660]   So I put together all of those schematics,
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.660]   or you know, block diagrams, they weren't schematics yet,
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.980]   'cause it was just me.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.700]   And coming up with a bill of materials,
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.220]   coming up with what it could look like,
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.260]   what would be the input output,
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.540]   how we could make a better headphone jack,
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.700]   that was also on there.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:07.140]   Screen suppliers, tearing apart calculators,
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.340]   so got calculators and all kinds of electronics
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:14.340]   to get the right size, different sizes of small LCDs.
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.300]   So I got all kinds of different battery types.
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.260]   I got different types of, you know,
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.380]   and different battery sizes, AA's, AAA's,
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.260]   working through all the different,
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.180]   and there was lithium ion, nickel metal hydrate.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.860]   So I took all the battery types,
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.940]   I took all of the memory types, processing types,
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:36.940]   LCD types, and connectivity,
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.180]   and all that stuff, not wireless, but wired,
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.180]   and laid out these things as Lego blocks.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:46.300]   So literally had all of these things as just,
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.860]   and so I made them so I could like, you know,
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.220]   put them together and figure out
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.900]   what the compact form factor would be.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.340]   - Oh, like how do we shove them together?
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.340]   What's the smallest possible box you can get?
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:01.220]   So the questions was on storage, so the hard drive,
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.460]   batteries, AA, AAA.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.660]   - Right.
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.740]   - Screens, so screen size, and then for that,
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.940]   you're tearing apart calculators.
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.620]   - Calculators, digital cameras, whatever,
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:12.740]   and getting little things, right?
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.740]   So you can make it physical, right?
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.060]   If you can make the intangible tangible,
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.180]   like, and so I can say, look, we can make this,
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.540]   and I brought this whole bag of goods,
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.580]   and it was like, right?
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.220]   And like, here's this, here's this.
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.940]   This is why AA's won't work,
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.500]   and 'cause it makes it too fat, and everything.
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.340]   So just educate everybody through,
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.340]   here's the parts that we can use.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.020]   - It's a not sheet of paper, it's physical.
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.300]   You're playing in the physical space.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.700]   - Oh, I would go back and forth.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.420]   So truth be told, because there weren't
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:43.180]   a good enough graphical tools on the Mac,
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.340]   I was using a PC with Vizio and some 3D tools,
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.100]   and I was doing 3D design at the same time
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.780]   I was taking all these physical parts,
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.220]   and going, okay, what feels right?
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.340]   'Cause you have to go from the details,
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.060]   and then the rough, and you go back and forth,
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.260]   and you iterate, right?
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.220]   And so it was just a lot of fun,
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.060]   and then I ultimately ended up with a styrofoam model
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.300]   and printouts that came from Vizio
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.220]   that I glued together and put my grandfather's
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.340]   fishing weights in, 'cause I also modeled the weights.
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.780]   Right, so I said, oh, this is this many ounces,
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.580]   this is this many ounces in grams.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.020]   And then I went and got all that,
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:21.220]   and made the, weighted these styrofoam models
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.380]   to then match that, so when you picked it up,
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.460]   it felt more or less form factor right,
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.660]   and it also, you felt how much,
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.580]   you know, was it gonna be dense enough?
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.820]   Is it gonna feel solid and rigid in your hand?
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.060]   Right?
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.980]   - Why does it need to feel rigid?
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.660]   - 'Cause it has to feel substantial.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:40.940]   It has to feel like I have like a bar of gold in my hand.
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:41.780]   Right? - Yeah.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.420]   - You know, maybe you know this,
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.460]   when you open and close a car door,
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.100]   you know that thunk and you go bam,
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.260]   and you go, that feels solid, that feels real,
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.260]   and then you get this tinny car that's like ding,
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.260]   and you're like, does this feel safe?
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.900]   Does this feel like a value?
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.300]   And so when you have a device like that,
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.900]   and you wanna make sure that there's not too much air in it,
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:05.660]   you distributed the density of the masses in the right way,
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.500]   so it feels like it's the right thing.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.500]   So you have to model battery life, costs,
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:16.100]   mass, sizes of different things,
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.380]   and then you have to also think about
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.060]   what the UI is gonna look like, right?
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.180]   So you have all of these constraints you're working,
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:22.500]   variables you're working with,
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.260]   and you have to kind of, you know,
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.300]   you can't get the perfect of everything.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.260]   What's the best, you know, local maximum
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.300]   of all of these components that come together
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.420]   to provide an experience?
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.300]   - Local maxims, it's always trade-offs.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.740]   What about buttons?
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.900]   - Buttons, well, there was also the buttons too, right?
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.540]   - Oh, by the way, a lot of these battles
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.940]   fought inside your mind, or is it with other people?
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.860]   Is it with Steve, is it lower, like what?
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.140]   - This was all independent.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.540]   This was me before being able to present to Steve,
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.020]   'cause I had to feel really confident
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.980]   that if I was gonna put this in front of him,
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.260]   that it could be made, right?
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.980]   So I had to convince myself,
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.620]   and go work through all the details,
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.340]   through the very, very rough mechanical design,
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.820]   electrical design, software things,
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.260]   because I didn't wanna present something
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.020]   that was gonna be fictional, right?
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.180]   My credibility would be like trashed, right?
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.060]   - So you mentioned convince yourself.
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.700]   You're painting this beautiful picture
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:19.700]   of a driven engineer, designer, futurist.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.900]   How much doubt were you plagued by through that,
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.380]   like this is even doable?
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.900]   'Cause it's not obvious that this is even doable.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.100]   Like to do this at scale, to do this kind of thing,
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:37.100]   to make it sexy, to shovel the screen,
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:42.580]   the batteries, the storage, to make the interface,
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.140]   the hardware and the software interface work, all of that.
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.220]   I mean, I don't know, I would be overwhelmed
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.220]   by the doubt of that, because so many things have to work,
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.580]   plus the supply chain.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.180]   - Like at that point, I wasn't getting
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.980]   into any of those details or anything.
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.180]   You know, there's the basic stuff
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.620]   that you have to put together.
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.260]   And then you have to, you know,
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.820]   through my learnings at General Magic
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.500]   and my learnings at Phillips and delivering, you know,
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.860]   multiple, you know, large-scale programs in manufacturing,
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.140]   you kind of get a rule of thumb
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.260]   and you know what to focus on at the beginning
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.460]   and what not to worry about over time.
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.780]   Like when I was early in my career,
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.900]   I worried about everything on the engineering details
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.740]   so much so that, you know, I would be a nervous wreck.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.660]   Sooner or later, you learn how to filter out
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.620]   and figure out what to prioritize.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.260]   And so 10 years later, you know,
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.300]   I was able to do a much better job
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.340]   of filtering out the things of like,
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.700]   we'll get to that in, you know, in weeks to come.
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.820]   But right now we got to like solve, you know,
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.060]   the very important things,
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.220]   which is, could this actually be something real
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.780]   and that you could deliver, you know,
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.700]   enough battery life, right?
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:46.860]   Enough of an interface, the right cost, right?
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.060]   And the right price point.
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.620]   - So you were sitting on a track record
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.460]   of successes and failures in your own mind
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:59.460]   where you had sort of already a confidence, a calmness,
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.340]   but still, was there a doubt that you can get this done?
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.180]   - Always, always.
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:08.460]   - How hard is it to achieve a sort of a confidence
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.300]   to a level where you could present it to Steve
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.340]   and actually believe that this is doable?
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:15.300]   Like, what, do you remember when you felt--
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.140]   - Yeah, that moment?
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:16.980]   - Yeah.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.540]   - I think it was after I triple checked,
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.540]   I couldn't bring anyone in, right?
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.500]   I couldn't let anyone in on this.
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.940]   So it was just me.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.660]   - Are they gonna trample on it, that kind of thing?
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.500]   Why?
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.540]   - No, no, no, no, because I couldn't bring any,
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.260]   when I mean bring anyone in on this,
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.780]   one, it was a highly confidential program inside Apple.
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.540]   There was like four people who knew about it, right?
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.220]   And so I couldn't bring anyone from Apple
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.060]   because I was a contractor.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.100]   I couldn't bring anyone else from the outside world.
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.460]   I'm working for Apple and I'm under this crazy NDA, right?
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.580]   In this contract.
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:48.940]   So it was just, it was,
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:50.740]   so I'm doing this.
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.660]   Oh, and at the same time,
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.540]   I'm also buying every competitive product,
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.900]   MP3 player and tearing them all apart, right?
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.140]   Tore them all apart and looking at them
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.100]   and trying to learn from those as well.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.340]   So it was all of this stuff in six weeks.
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.380]   So I didn't sleep, right?
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.340]   - But I was like, because I was trying to make this,
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.740]   I was envisioning this since the Nino, right?
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.220]   And I was like, oh my God, right?
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.140]   But there was another doubt that I had.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.540]   And it wasn't just, could you make the product?
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:24.540]   But could Apple actually have the balls to make it?
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.220]   Because Apple was not the same company
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:31.500]   that you know it today in 2001.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.340]   - Really?
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.060]   It was cautious, conservative, careful?
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:34.900]   - No, no, no.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.340]   It was barely break-even.
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:39.180]   It was worth four or $5 billion company.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.100]   - Oh, so the guts required there
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.060]   is not necessarily in the innovation.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.260]   It's like, this is gonna cost a lot of money
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.140]   and we're gonna potentially lose all of it
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.660]   'cause it'll be a flop.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.020]   - Well, there's not just that, but there was only the Mac.
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:54.780]   And the Mac wasn't doing very well.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.580]   There was less, it was about a 1%
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.060]   only in the US market share for the Mac, right?
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.700]   The company was in debt.
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:07.660]   Bill Gates had to give him a loan, right?
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.820]   Michael Dell at the time was saying,
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.940]   shut down the company
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:13.940]   and give the money back to the shareholders.
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:17.420]   So this is not the company that people go,
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:18.900]   oh my God, the iPhone came out.
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.660]   It's a very different level of confidence
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:24.340]   and financial situation that the company was in
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.580]   versus the iPod.
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.620]   - So given that, what was the conversation
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.460]   when you finally presented to Steve?
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:33.220]   What was that conversation like?
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:37.900]   - The conversation was, well, we went through it,
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.820]   the presentation and all that stuff happened.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.420]   And he was just like,
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.540]   and he would flip through it real quick,
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.220]   throw the presentation aside and said,
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:49.740]   okay, let's talk about this, right?
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:51.380]   And so we went through it all.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:55.660]   And one was a big conversation about Sony.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:41:00.380]   And Sony was the number one in all audio categories,
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.860]   home, portable, whatever, in the world, okay?
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:07.420]   I had been already gone through 10 years of failure.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.260]   And I was like, wait a second,
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.940]   how are we gonna compete with Sony?
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:14.300]   And I was always worried that Sony was gonna come out
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.100]   with whatever it was that we're gonna come out with,
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.860]   their MP3 player, and that was it, game over, right?
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:23.300]   And so I was like, Steve,
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.220]   and this is why it took me four weeks
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.980]   to finally sign on to join Apple
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:32.060]   after he green-lighted the iPod program in that meeting,
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:35.180]   was because I had built other things in the past
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.820]   at Philips, the Nino and Velo,
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.820]   but they didn't know how to sell it or market it.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.380]   They didn't know how to retail it, right?
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.860]   So I was like, we could build this.
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.140]   And I was like, Steve, I'm pretty sure I can build this.
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:49.020]   I've done this before, but how are we gonna sell it?
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.380]   You have all your marketing dollars on the Mac.
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.180]   And he looked at me and he goes,
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.940]   you build this with a team and our team
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.580]   and Apple and just me, right?
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:03.020]   And I dedicate that we will make sure
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.580]   that at least two quarters of all marketing dollars
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.120]   will only go to this product and nothing else.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.360]   - Wow.
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.200]   - Right?
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.240]   Mac was the lifeblood of all revenue of the company.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.080]   - So Steve saw something special here.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.440]   - Exactly.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.880]   And he said, I'm going to commit all the marketing dollars.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.560]   If you can deliver the experience
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.040]   that we're all talking about, if we can do that,
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.160]   and that was Jeff Robbin as well,
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.200]   'cause iPod would have never happened without iTunes.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.300]   You know, people don't understand that was a bundle.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.720]   You couldn't do one without the other and vice versa.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.200]   So Jeff and I were, you know,
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.520]   if Jeff and you can present and bring that experience
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.660]   to life, I will put all the marketing dollars behind it.
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:47.160]   - When did the marriage of iPod and iTunes sort of,
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:53.240]   what was that birth of ideas that made up iTunes?
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.480]   - iTunes existed before the iPod, okay?
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.600]   And so Jeff Robbin had his company,
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.880]   oh man, I can't remember the name of it, but it was bought.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.520]   He was making a MP3 player app for the Mac.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.240]   Steve saw it because there was MP3 player apps
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.640]   like Winamp and other things that were on the PC,
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.960]   real player, and Steve saw that going on
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.840]   and saw that Jeff and his small team had this,
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.780]   I can't remember, Sound something.
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:23.000]   Anyways, he bought that and that became the basis of iTunes
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.920]   and then Jeff ran all of iTunes.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.960]   And so what happened specifically there was
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:28.960]   they were starting to hook up
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.380]   to all these third-party MP3 players
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:34.600]   'cause there's a lot of Korean, the MP man,
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.800]   like Walkman, but MP man, all these,
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.320]   and they were trying to hook 'em up
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.160]   and they were like, these are horrible experiences.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.880]   And through that, and they said iTunes was something
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.560]   that was gonna help grow the Mac base
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.440]   because we were trying to get more people on the Mac.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.560]   So this program would be a great new thing
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.080]   you could add to the Mac.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.640]   And there was also internet connectivity
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.080]   at the time for the iMac.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.360]   And so they did that and then they're trying
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.160]   to do these hookups.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.300]   They weren't going well.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.540]   And that's when they said, we need to build our own.
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:06.180]   Or Steve said, we need to build our own
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:08.040]   since these are such horrible experiences.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.680]   People don't wanna just burn CDs from iTunes.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.940]   We need to get that music on the go,
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.420]   but in an Apple fashion.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:18.420]   That's when I was called to come in to do that,
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.900]   the iPod thing, after the six weeks.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:24.300]   Then he already envisioned, I'm sure he had it envisioned
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.740]   'cause they were trying to do this thing.
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.380]   Okay, now that's it.
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:32.500]   iTunes, what, it wasn't called iPod yet.
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.840]   What would become the iPod?
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.600]   That is gonna be the thing that then propels Apple
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.160]   into this new thing because you're gonna bring
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.400]   all these music lovers in that are gonna need
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:45.400]   their next generation or Sony Walkman version 2.0.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:51.720]   - So when you look at, again, apologies to linger on iPod,
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:56.560]   but it's one of the great inventions in tech history.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.800]   What wisdom do you draw from that whole process
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.660]   about spotting an idea?
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:07.160]   This is something you talk about in your book, Build.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:11.480]   How do you know that an idea is brilliant?
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.800]   At which stage?
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.640]   When did you know it was a good idea?
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.680]   (laughing)
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:22.000]   And maybe is there some phase shifts?
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.160]   First you complete out, then maybe, hmm.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.160]   And then maybe it becomes more than a hmm
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.920]   and becomes a little more confidence, that kind of stuff.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.040]   And also wisdom about who to talk to
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.880]   so they don't trample the idea in the early stages,
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.000]   that kind of stuff.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.240]   Any thoughts about this?
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.740]   - We could go on, again, how long do you wanna go?
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:43.720]   (laughing)
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.940]   - This is a Netflix series, I told you.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.280]   Multi-season.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.460]   - So a lot of lessons learned over those years
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:51.980]   of failure and success.
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:55.840]   But the first thing it starts with,
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.720]   there's a whole chapter called Great Ideas Chase You.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.720]   And so it kinda goes into in Build.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.080]   And it goes through kinda chapter and verse
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:07.440]   about all of those, how Nest became into being.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.860]   But let's talk about it specifically for iPod.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:13.560]   So for me, I always had pain,
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.800]   the pain of carrying these CDs everywhere.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.520]   And I had the joy of music.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.780]   If you could say all of a sudden I could get
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.820]   the music I love all the time in a portable package
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.080]   and I can have all the music I love all the time.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.600]   I was solving a pain, which was,
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.840]   for me it was thousands of CDs,
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.980]   other people might be 10 or 15 CDs.
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:38.160]   And then I can have the joy of all this music uninterrupted.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:43.240]   That was taking the pain, making a painkiller for it.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.380]   And then at the end was a superpower,
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.160]   an emotional superpower that said,
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.580]   oh my, this is something different.
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:53.160]   So when you can actually focus on a pain
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.400]   and get a painkiller for it, not a vitamin.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.800]   So the difference between a painkiller
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.960]   and a vitamin is very clear.
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.900]   One, you need, I gotta get rid of this pain.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.340]   A vitamin, maybe it works, maybe it doesn't,
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:06.840]   maybe somebody needs it, maybe not,
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.960]   it's all marketing story, right?
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.600]   So you start with the pain, give 'em a painkiller,
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.820]   and hopefully if you can do it in the right way,
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.580]   you give them a superpower, an emotional superpower.
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:21.580]   That is always, and that's the way to know
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.740]   that you're hitting on something that's really powerful.
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.540]   - The pain and the joy.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:26.940]   - Exactly.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:30.360]   - Are you always aware of the pain?
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:34.300]   So it seems like a lot of great products,
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.340]   it's like we do a lot of painful things
[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:40.000]   and we just kind of assume that's the way
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.620]   it's supposed to be, like with much autonomous vehicles,
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:45.260]   we all assume we're supposed to be driving.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:50.500]   And it doesn't, you don't think of it as a pain.
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.740]   - Right, well you've habituated it away.
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.140]   - Yeah. - You've habituated it away.
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.860]   For me, when I go to other places,
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.060]   living in Bali or living in Paris or whatever,
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:05.100]   and I'm not driving, I'm walking or I'm using a scooter
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.820]   or what have you, different thing,
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:10.220]   and you go, oh my God, when you left that environment,
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.340]   because everyone else is driving all the time,
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.580]   you're like, that's what you do.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:15.620]   And you find out there's other ways of living
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:17.580]   and there's freedom when you get rid of that,
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:20.620]   and you're like, oh my God, I didn't know
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:21.780]   that this was so much better.
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.740]   So there's something in the book that's called out
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.540]   and I deemed it the virus of doubt.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:31.020]   And what the virus of doubt is, is when there's pain
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.240]   and it's been habituated away,
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.900]   you use the right marketing messages
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:39.500]   to bring people back to that initial experience they had
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.220]   or the initial experience that they had of that pain.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.580]   Do you remember when the first time you did blah
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:48.980]   and it felt like this, right?
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:53.460]   And then you reawaken that habituated pain.
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:57.020]   And people, and it becomes visceral,
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:01.180]   and then they're like, oh, yes, I hate that.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.060]   And then you go, now I have the painkiller
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.780]   and the joy for you.
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:08.080]   That's when it all comes together and it goes.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:12.740]   - Let me, on this, on the pain and the joy
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:17.740]   that's brilliantly put, you mentioned selling
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.740]   and marketing, right?
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.220]   Marketing dollars.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:25.260]   I have a love-hate relationship with marketing,
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:30.940]   like with a lot of things that require artistic genius.
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:34.100]   To me, the best marketing, I suppose,
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.460]   is the product itself and then word of mouth.
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:40.420]   So like create a thing that people love.
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.940]   - Oh, absolutely, that's fundamental.
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:46.580]   - Yeah, but so any other marketing requires genius
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.460]   to be any extra thing.
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:53.460]   'Cause to me, I don't, yeah, maybe you can,
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:56.380]   by way of question, 'cause you're,
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.220]   (laughing)
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:01.660]   I'm just speaking off the top of my head as a consumer.
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:03.700]   What is great marketing?
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:08.300]   What does it take to reveal the pain and the joy of a thing?
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:11.860]   - Okay, it all starts at the beginning.
[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:13.420]   And let me give you, I'm gonna give you
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.900]   a couple of different ways of looking at it, okay?
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.500]   And again, we might go a little long here.
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:22.260]   So just stay tuned in.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.900]   So the first thing is-- - Start at the beginning.
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.060]   - Let's start at the beginning.
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:28.300]   In the early part of my career,
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.200]   like General Magic and Phillips and what have you,
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:36.420]   and especially when I was a teenager,
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:39.920]   when I was making my own chips and stuff like that,
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:44.100]   I really worried about just putting cool things together.
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.580]   I'm like, that, when I put those two cool things together
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.900]   as an engineer, you go, that's cool.
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.500]   And then I would talk to the other friends
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.260]   who might be geeks too, and they go, yeah, that's cool.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:57.060]   Because we knew the bits, so we put them together
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.260]   and that's a new way of doing it.
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:02.860]   And you're like, wow, that's all what?
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:03.960]   It's not why.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.380]   Why are you doing this?
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:08.340]   We know what we're doing, but we don't know
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.340]   why we're doing it 'cause we're not articulating it
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.180]   for ourselves 'cause it's just something
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.160]   we're like putting it together and like, yeah, that's cool
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.920]   because we think we're solving some problem we have,
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.700]   but we're not really articulating it.
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:21.860]   So what normally happens, and this happens
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.940]   'cause we invest in so many companies around the world,
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.980]   you have these brilliant engineers, designers,
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:31.560]   scientists, researchers, they put together these what's.
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.780]   And then they develop it, develop it, develop it,
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.180]   and then at the end, they call in marketing
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.700]   and say, now tell a story about this
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.920]   and let's get it out to the world, okay?
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.380]   What happens then is marketing's like,
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.300]   well, why do people need this?
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:50.220]   Tell us why people need it.
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.540]   And so they create a story around this product,
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:56.920]   but the product was born out of what's, not why's.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:00.780]   And so they start telling, marketing starts telling a story
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:03.520]   and it turns out to be a fictional story usually.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.200]   They say, oh, this is going to do these things.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.940]   The product comes and is delivered.
[00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:10.100]   And it falls flat on its face
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:12.940]   because the marketing doesn't match the product
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.500]   because they weren't both created
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:17.960]   at the beginning together, right?
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.700]   There are what's when you create a product,
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.380]   but there's a lot more why's,
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.740]   and the why's help inform the what's.
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:27.040]   And the why's also inform the marketing.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:31.280]   - So that's what you mean deeply,
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.640]   we should start at the beginning.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.620]   So the designer should be also the marketer.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:37.380]   The engineer should be the marketer.
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:40.580]   - Exactly, stop impressing the geek next to you.
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:42.560]   What is the superpower you're bringing
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:47.560]   or the pain you're killing for the end customer, right?
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.960]   Now let's contrast that.
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:53.040]   Think about a movie.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.900]   A movie starts with a treatment.
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:56.860]   It has an audience that says the audience,
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:59.200]   here's the characters, here's the storyline, the plot,
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:02.700]   here's the arc of the story, right?
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.620]   It pulls that all out.
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.420]   Then there's a script that's written.
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:09.540]   And that script is then produced.
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.540]   And then you add all the flourishes and what have you,
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:14.740]   music and graphics and what have you, right?
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:15.820]   And then it comes out,
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.260]   and then there's the marketing of the movie.
[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.700]   And that story was created at the beginning.
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.780]   What you need to do if you're gonna do a great product
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:24.960]   is create that treatment for your product.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.980]   And I call that the press release.
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:30.500]   Do the press release, like the treatment,
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.260]   who's the audience, what features do you have,
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:35.020]   what pains are you solving for people?
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:37.820]   To have the virus of doubt there to remind them
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.060]   what pains they have and why you're solving them,
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:41.780]   the price, all of those things.
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:45.300]   And you use that as the bar,
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:48.540]   the measuring stick for what you do during development.
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:52.620]   Because what happens that along the route, you know this,
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.420]   oh, we're not gonna be able to get that feature done on time.
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:58.500]   Throw that one overboard, we have to hit the date.
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:01.020]   Oh, we're not sure this product's right yet.
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.620]   Add another feature.
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.340]   Add another feature creep, right?
[00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:07.300]   If you don't have that story you know you're gonna tell
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:11.460]   at the beginning, you don't have that bar, right?
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.740]   And then at the end, you don't know when you're done
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:14.580]   if you don't have that story.
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:16.920]   So you can actually look at that press release.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:21.900]   You change it over time, that draft.
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:24.880]   But then when you're done, you know the what's and the why's,
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:26.900]   you have all the things, the audience and everything,
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.500]   and then you can give that to marketing and say,
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.100]   well, and marketing's been along the way, let's be clear.
[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:33.900]   But then everybody's in sync.
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:37.300]   And that's when you can tell a cohesive non-fictional story
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.580]   about, and the product delivers on that story,
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.980]   or hopefully over delivers on that story.
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:46.520]   - So in the drafting from the beginning to the end
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.820]   of the press release, what does a successful team look like?
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.500]   Who's part of the draft?
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.540]   Is it engineers, designers?
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:57.780]   What's the purpose of a marketing department in a company,
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:02.420]   small, let's say small company, but more than two people?
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:06.860]   So from where does the why come from?
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:08.780]   Should it always come from the designer,
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.540]   or should there be a marketing person
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:13.620]   that steps in and asks the question?
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.060]   So I'll just keep asking random questions.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.860]   - I know these are great questions.
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:20.060]   So, 'cause you're just like, I'm like,
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:22.180]   I can't wait to tell you the answer.
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.740]   So it's in the book as well.
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:25.740]   But you have to separate out
[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.780]   the various functions of marketing.
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:30.540]   When, that's what I thought.
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:31.820]   I was like, marketing's marketing.
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:34.380]   You know, and I was, and it's really not.
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:36.580]   There's so many disciplines, just like in engineering,
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:39.420]   mechanical, electrical, software, and even software.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:41.660]   It's, you know, are you cloud services,
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:43.660]   firmware, applications?
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:47.060]   Marketing has that much diversity as well, okay?
[00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:48.940]   And you have to honor that.
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:52.340]   And so there is marketing communications,
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:54.660]   like PR, press, press.
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:57.900]   There is social marketing.
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:00.940]   There is a marketing creative, right?
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:02.740]   There's marketing activation.
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:06.460]   But there's another thing that also comes out,
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:10.420]   and people confuse it with marketing,
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:14.140]   which is called product marketing or product management.
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:16.460]   And product management or product marketing
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:18.060]   is the voice of the customer.
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:21.980]   They're the person who sits there
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.380]   and listens to what's going on
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:26.140]   in the competition, in the marketplace,
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:29.180]   understanding the needs and those pains of the customer.
[00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:32.340]   And they're representing them in every single meeting
[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:35.620]   so things don't get off track, right?
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:39.020]   So that, and they're creating the messages,
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.060]   not the marketing.
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.340]   What happens is there's messages
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.580]   that product marketing creates.
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:43.980]   Like, those are the deep messages.
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:48.780]   Like, we need to save 20% of energy, let's say, right?
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:50.860]   And then marketing turns that into something
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:52.980]   that's with creative and everything
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:54.260]   and brings that message across.
[00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:55.140]   Maybe it doesn't say that,
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:58.180]   but it comes maybe visually or some other way.
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.620]   So product management does that
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:05.460]   and holds that press release along the route
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:07.700]   and making sure that we're tracking.
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:10.220]   And then also marketing is tracking with that press release
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:12.780]   to make sure they're not telling a fictional story, right?
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:15.900]   'Cause they can also add extra adjectives or something,
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:17.380]   and then the product can't deliver that.
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:18.820]   It's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:19.660]   Keeps everybody in check.
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:21.300]   - It has to be grounded to the press release,
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:22.140]   to the raw sort of ideas.
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:24.100]   - Right, to the customer needs, right?
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:25.980]   'Cause they're always representing the customer.
[00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:28.740]   So you have to have a product manager.
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:32.260]   Typically, that's the founder, right, in the beginning.
[00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:36.500]   And then over time, you hire a product management team
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:40.260]   to then really watch over this the whole way.
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:42.740]   And they are talking to customer support.
[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:43.700]   They're talking to engineering.
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.180]   They're talking to design.
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:47.660]   They're talking to sales and marketing.
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.580]   And they are always in the mix.
[00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:52.540]   And it's the hardest thing to hire for.
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:53.500]   - Ooh, yeah.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.660]   So they have this very important job
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:58.980]   of developing and maintaining the why.
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:59.860]   - Exactly.
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:01.700]   - Why is it the hardest to hire for?
[00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:03.580]   - Because you have to understand.
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.160]   First, nobody reports to you.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:07.380]   - You're alone.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.580]   - So you're alone, and you have to build great ties
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:13.780]   with all of these different functions.
[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:15.940]   You have to understand what they do,
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:17.700]   be empathetic with what they do,
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:21.980]   and you have to project the customer's empathy
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:25.340]   or empathy for the customer to them and tell them why
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:28.740]   and why this customer needs this, why this doesn't work,
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.300]   and so that they learn more.
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:31.140]   They're not just doing,
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:33.860]   but they learn about the customer's point of view
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:37.220]   and stand in their shoes to be able to then
[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:39.580]   make better decisions on the engineering details
[00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:42.620]   or the operational details, customer support details,
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.140]   so they understand.
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:48.500]   If they're not the customer that it's intended for,
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:51.620]   they start to live through their eyes
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:53.820]   and see through their eyes of that customer
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:55.140]   so they make better decisions.
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:59.500]   - And there's probably fascinating, beautiful tensions
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:03.540]   between that and sort of the engineers,
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:08.220]   oh, that's cool, sort of the developing the what.
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:09.260]   - Exactly.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.900]   - Which makes it an extra hard job, I'm sure.
[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:12.740]   - Exactly.
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:15.780]   - Can I ask a sort of a little bit of a personal question?
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:19.000]   One subfield of marketing, you mentioned comms and PR.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.740]   (sighs)
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.580]   How do I ask this?
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:26.200]   - I can hear your struggle in your sigh.
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:32.940]   - Why or do the comms and PR folks sometimes
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:41.480]   kill the heart and soul of the magic that makes a company?
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:45.140]   Or is that wrong to say?
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:46.700]   Give me an example.
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:48.980]   - I will say the spirit of the example,
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:53.980]   which is it feels like often the jobs of communications
[00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:57.620]   is to provide caution.
[00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:01.300]   It almost works together with legal to say--
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.140]   - A shield.
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:06.520]   - Yeah, we probably should not say this.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.180]   Let's be careful, let's be careful.
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:14.180]   Now, that makes sense, except in this modern world,
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:20.180]   authenticity is extremely valuable.
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:24.980]   And revealing the beauty that is in the engineering,
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:29.900]   the beauty of the ideas, the chaos of the ideas,
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:33.380]   I think requires throwing caution to the wind
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.700]   to some degree.
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:35.540]   - I agree.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:40.540]   - And I just find that, boy, I mean, it's really,
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:43.020]   so to push back on myself,
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.420]   I think it's an extremely difficult job
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:47.500]   because people hold you responsible
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:51.500]   if you're doing communications when you take risks.
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.340]   - Right.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.820]   - And especially when they fail.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:57.540]   So it's like, it's a difficult job.
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:59.580]   So I understand why people become cautious,
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:03.540]   but to me, communications is about taking big risks
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:06.100]   and throwing caution to the wind at its best
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:11.100]   because your job is to communicate in the long term,
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:16.020]   communicate the genius, the joy,
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:19.300]   the genius of the product.
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.140]   - Right.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:23.180]   - And that sometimes is attention with caution.
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.420]   Sorry, so I, because I've gotten a chance
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.620]   to meet a lot of very interesting people
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:31.300]   and interesting engineering teams and so on,
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.340]   I look at what they're doing
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.780]   and I look at what's being communicated
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.700]   and it's just, there's a mismatch
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.140]   because the communication is a lot more boring.
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.140]   It's like, there's something very,
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:45.940]   like just straight up boring
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:49.820]   about the way they're communicating because of caution.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:50.780]   - Okay.
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:54.740]   You have just teed me up or another diatribe, okay?
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:58.140]   I'm gonna get on my podium here.
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:58.980]   - Yes, please.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:03.140]   It all comes out of the leader.
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.420]   If the leader doesn't know how to storytell
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:09.780]   or the leader doesn't know how to do bold storytelling,
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:14.340]   then you get even more conservatism
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:17.380]   from the PR and communications folks
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:19.540]   because they're always, so if you have a,
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:23.660]   not a bold leader, they're always going to be a filter.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.900]   Right, they're always gonna try to smooth things out
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:27.660]   and take off the rough edges and try,
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:28.740]   so they're gonna be even more,
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:31.540]   if you have a conservative messaging leader,
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:33.900]   you're gonna have even a more conservative
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.300]   communications department.
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.300]   Why, because they wanna keep their jobs.
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:40.140]   Okay, it's really simple.
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:41.060]   They gotta keep their jobs.
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:44.460]   If they say one wrong thing, it could be the end of it.
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.780]   So if you have a very conservative leader,
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.940]   they're going to be even more conservative.
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:51.020]   If you have a bold leader, they will be,
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:54.260]   oh, they'll always take a little more conservative bend,
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:56.460]   but you're still gonna have bold communications.
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.700]   - Yeah, that's brilliant.
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:00.220]   - Okay, so it starts with the leader.
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:05.220]   Now, that said, when you think about the messages
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:11.260]   and the joy and revealing things, right,
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:18.580]   many of these leaders don't tell great stories.
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:22.380]   So what we do at FutureShape, our investment firm,
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.340]   is we take those scientists, all of,
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:25.820]   and the great minds and everything,
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.220]   and what do we surround them with?
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:31.500]   Marketing and communication people and storytellers
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:36.020]   to give them the confidence to tell a much broader story
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:39.100]   about the impacts of what they're creating
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:43.700]   and how big the global change can be with those technologies
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:45.340]   because usually they don't,
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:47.620]   those leaders who created those technologies,
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.500]   they don't really know how to communicate really well
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:52.780]   and they don't feel very comfortable in how they speak.
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:55.660]   - Yeah, so it's interesting 'cause stories,
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:57.860]   I'm a huge fan of stories.
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:01.660]   Have you ever read the book "Story" by Robert McKee?
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:04.660]   You should read this, and this is what I read when I was 26.
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:08.460]   "Story" by Robert McKee, and it's a book
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:12.500]   all about the ways to do script writing,
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:16.700]   the prototypical types of scripts, drama, comedy,
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:20.580]   and how it's been shown over millennia
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.740]   how these stories are done.
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:26.060]   It's a fascinating thing and it gives you an insight to,
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:28.660]   and it's written for obviously Hollywood
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:30.620]   and movies and things like that,
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:33.900]   but it's incredibly useful for what we do
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:37.980]   as designers and engineers and technology leaders.
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:40.300]   - There's some aspect in this modern day
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.640]   where this podcast and so on,
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:47.300]   what I love is the humans behind the story too.
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.540]   So some part of the story is the human beings.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:54.420]   So humor, drama,
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:57.380]   heartbreak, hope.
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:58.220]   - Emotions.
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:59.540]   - Emotions.
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:03.060]   That's not just about painting a beautiful story
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.740]   that's flawless, it's--
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:06.620]   - Vulnerability.
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:11.620]   - Yep, it's being a dreamer, over-promising,
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:16.220]   and then failing, so changing your mind,
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:18.540]   realizing just the whole of it,
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:21.500]   and then also being, depending, of course,
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:26.020]   where your personality is, embracing the full richness
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.620]   and the complexity of the personality of the leader
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:30.300]   or the different people involved.
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:31.780]   I mean, that's all part of it.
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:34.740]   Like you can't just present this beautiful,
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:37.860]   always Pleasantville view of a product.
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:42.860]   There has to be this humanity that's part of it,
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:45.940]   the full rollercoaster of the humanity,
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.460]   which I think has been very difficult
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.420]   for companies to embrace.
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.420]   I'm not sure why.
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.700]   Maybe it's just an old-school way of doing things
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:57.620]   that people think that we present a facade
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:02.860]   and we generate the story and we tell the story
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:04.700]   as opposed to sort of--
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.460]   - Well, we learn, especially in the technical world,
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:11.300]   we present the story as it's faster, it's smaller,
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:14.580]   it's longer battery life, it's bits and numbers
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:17.440]   and metrics.
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:22.380]   That resonates, sure, with other geeks.
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:26.740]   What resonates with the planet?
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:28.540]   It's all emotions, right?
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:31.220]   And if you can bring a great emotional story
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.780]   but with a great rational story at the same time,
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:36.940]   why you should do this, and it's like, oh my God,
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:41.340]   you bring that superpower, that joy, then it all hangs.
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:45.020]   - And there's personal drama too, like the human.
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:46.060]   - Right.
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:48.740]   Here's the pain I had, remember that thing?
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:53.740]   - And I mean, just, you're obviously
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:59.020]   this extremely well-known human being
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:02.460]   that's behind a lot of these great inventions
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:03.580]   of the technology world,
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:04.860]   but you're also just a human being.
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:09.380]   You have a clearly, like, a distinct personality
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:11.840]   that comes through, like your eyes light up,
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.880]   just the way you communicate, it's you.
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:16.460]   - Thank you.
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:18.700]   - Some people are more stoic, some people are,
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:23.000]   like Elon is all over the place, the chaos.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.140]   Steve Jobs, there's a very, I mean,
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:29.460]   it's hard to put into words, I can be poetic and so on,
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:32.860]   but there's a very distinct, comes on stage,
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:35.860]   that personality right there, that's not just the product,
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:37.220]   that's something else too.
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.060]   - Correct.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:40.180]   - And you have to reveal that a little bit
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:43.140]   and allow people to reveal that a little bit
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:45.860]   and just let them be themselves.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:50.860]   - Well, look, why do I think your podcast is so amazing?
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:53.060]   Because you are yourself.
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:55.620]   You talk about yourself, you bring your emotions into it,
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:08:00.500]   and you don't modulate it, you're you, right?
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.980]   It comes through, it's true, it feels right.
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:07.540]   You are you, you dress the way you wanna dress,
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:09.620]   you say, "This is me and this is all of me,"
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.540]   and you become vulnerable, right?
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:14.060]   It's much easier to do a podcast like that
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:17.300]   than run a very large company where a lot of people
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:18.780]   would feel the pain if you make,
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:20.220]   if you say something stupid.
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:21.060]   - Right.
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:26.060]   - So it's much more easy to be afraid and be careful.
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:29.800]   But nevertheless, the same applies.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:36.140]   Authenticity and risk-taking is the only way, unfortunately,
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:39.540]   to be successful in the long term.
[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:41.460]   Let me, just 'cause we're jumping all over the place,
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:42.940]   (Lex laughing)
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:44.660]   just linger on the iPod.
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:46.460]   - Sure. - One of the great designs,
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:50.820]   broadly speaking in the word design of all time,
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:53.700]   what does it take to design a great product?
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:56.700]   If you look, we could jump around, we could look at Nest,
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:59.620]   we can look at iPod, we can look at iPhone,
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:02.620]   and many of the great things you design,
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:07.620]   but just looking at that one transformational thing,
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:13.220]   what can you say about what it takes to do a great design?
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:15.200]   Or maybe what makes a great design?
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:22.900]   - Well, we talked about a painkiller,
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:27.820]   and we talked about that joy that comes from it.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:33.180]   But then there's the behind the scenes, there's the team,
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:35.300]   there's everyone who brings it to life,
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.840]   brings that story to life.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.840]   If you have a great story, and you know the why,
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.240]   then you can communicate it to those people
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.000]   who are working on it.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.060]   And then they bring their own thing into it, right?
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.180]   It becomes emotional for them too.
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.380]   It's not just a job, it's a mission.
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:58.400]   And so many of the details that are born
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.000]   out of these early prototypes,
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.840]   these things that you still haven't given full form to,
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:08.880]   there may be 80% done, or maybe even 60% done,
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.720]   but you can see enough in there.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.720]   Then you take those great ideas,
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.960]   and you give the why's to the team.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.520]   And so that they feel it, they can understand it,
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:22.640]   then they bring their best and their ideas to the table,
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.640]   and then you can select from those,
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.160]   and you can then start to,
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:29.840]   it could be just a pixel change.
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.400]   It could be a slight change on how you do the audio
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.840]   for the feedback, or maybe a curve on the mechanics,
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.200]   or something like that of how it feels.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.920]   Because everybody brings themselves
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.720]   trying to feel this thing.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.720]   They're not just doing something
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.480]   that someone told them to do.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.200]   If you can instill that mission, and that why into that team,
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.520]   it doesn't have to be big, you get, I feel, a 10X.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.960]   Everyone comes together in a special way,
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:58.760]   and the magic is created.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.680]   You put the love into it,
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.640]   the customer feels the love on the other side.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.880]   - So the,
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.160]   making the team,
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.760]   like taking them in onto the vision, onto the why,
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:16.240]   now they feel, all the little details we think of,
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:21.240]   the original iPod, and all the many generations after,
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:25.320]   all those little details are,
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.680]   in them is the emotion of the engineers and the designers.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.600]   It's their baby.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.160]   - Working nights, struggling, this isn't right.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:37.080]   Like you said, changing little pixels here and there,
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:40.080]   changing the shape of things,
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.440]   changing the feel of things,
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:47.080]   like the materials, the, I don't know,
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.320]   just everything on the software,
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.520]   and the heart of the packaging.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.520]   - The words on the packaging.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.360]   - Just everything.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.880]   - The words on the website.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:57.240]   - And always jumping from the very specific detail problem
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.200]   to the big picture, how the thing feels, the overall.
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.600]   - Always jumping back and forth.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.960]   What does it look like to the customer?
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:07.680]   How are we gonna implement it in the most efficient way?
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:10.360]   'Cause a lot of the stuff you don't know
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.520]   is some of that stuff is hacked in,
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.720]   maybe hacked in at the end.
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:17.040]   It may not be the most beautiful architecture
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:17.960]   that a geek would look at and go,
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.760]   "Oh my God, that's so beautiful,"
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.400]   'cause we can look at and visualize
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:24.480]   this incredible software stack or hardware stack.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.680]   Some of it could just be hacked in.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.280]   You make it better over time,
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.280]   but it was that brilliant thing,
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.600]   and we gotta get that in,
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.240]   because that's the way you do it now,
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.200]   and we'll make it more efficient later.
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:38.600]   - Maybe this is a good moment to draw a distinction
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.240]   between design and engineering,
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.480]   and does such a distinction even exist?
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.400]   Are these distinct disciplines or no?
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.880]   - I don't think they're distinct.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.960]   I think they're different types of design.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:54.960]   I think there's always this idea of this,
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.400]   oh, on the mount, designer, and it all comes down,
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.720]   and it all flows down like some magic.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:05.360]   There are electrical designers, there's AI designers,
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:07.760]   there is data scientist designers.
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:10.600]   Everybody has design, and there's a chapter in the book
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:14.120]   all about that, actually, that it's not just,
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.760]   you go to the mount, and it comes down,
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.520]   and you're enlightened.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.760]   It's each person brings their form of design
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:24.120]   and their craft, 'cause if they're really good,
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.480]   they're artists in their own right.
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.680]   They're not just engineers, they're not just designers,
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.560]   they're artists, they're empathetic,
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.920]   they really wanna bring their best.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:33.640]   A lot of the best engineers I have are not the technical,
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.360]   or that I've worked with, are not the technical
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.200]   gotta get it exactly right.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.840]   They're the artists, they came from music,
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:43.400]   or they came from other things, and they see that.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.000]   When you work with very rigid engineers,
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.440]   this is the way, the only way, la la la,
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.400]   those are not the engineers I wanna work with.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.760]   - They're all a bit artists at heart.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:59.040]   - Right, they understand the practicalness.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:01.240]   They don't have to have the rigidity of,
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:03.440]   this is the way it's done.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:08.920]   If you're building something new, all new and revolutionary,
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.440]   none of us are experts at it.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:14.400]   And if you come with that expert mindset, just tell me,
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.400]   and I can give you a story,
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.320]   I should probably give you that story,
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:21.200]   about that if you come with the expert, and I'm the expert,
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.760]   when you're doing something no one's ever done before,
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.480]   I don't want you on the team.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.640]   Because we all are learning about something
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.800]   that has never been in existence before.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.480]   And we have to bring that level of vulnerability
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:37.640]   and openness to new ideas and new ways of doing things
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.480]   throughout the team.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.600]   - So you want people that are able to have
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.960]   that beginner's mind or whatever,
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.320]   don't come in as an expert, what's the story?
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.680]   - Okay, not a lot of story.
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.800]   No, I can tell it.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:50.880]   - All right.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:55.280]   So you asked what were these risks,
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.680]   like on the early iPod, and there was a few big risks.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.920]   Like one, and this doesn't go in the story,
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:03.920]   but like putting rotating media in your pocket
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.040]   and it could drop at any time, what happens there?
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.680]   And like you can damage, 'cause the heads
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:13.240]   and the hard drive media are so close, it smacks, it's dead.
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:16.640]   So that was one big one, like holy shit, right?
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.840]   So that was something, and we had to design special tests
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:21.040]   and everything and special software on that.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.560]   But then there was another one, which was at the early days,
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.760]   the way the first generations of iPods,
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:31.760]   I had to hack the IDE interface to the hard drives.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.320]   So I was like, okay, what we're gonna use
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.920]   is we're gonna use this chip for hard drive,
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:41.000]   to make a hard drive, you had to have a chip
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.840]   that did firewire to a hard drive, okay?
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.760]   And then that would become a portable hard drive.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:50.680]   Well, then we had the MP3 player
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.360]   and the user interface and everything.
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.480]   So there was times when it was just this hard drive
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.440]   and there was times when it was a MP3 player
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:01.760]   and I had to hot switch between what the hard drive
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.900]   thinks it was talking to, right?
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:05.800]   So designed this thing, tore it apart,
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.500]   did all this stuff, and I was like,
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:10.840]   maybe I'm gonna screw up IDE and there's something,
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.000]   there's some holes I'm gonna see.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.400]   So I go, who's the expert at Apple
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.400]   who understands IDE and everything?
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.160]   So this person comes over,
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.560]   the mass storage specialist comes over
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.960]   and I put on the whiteboard and said,
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:25.880]   here's how we're gonna do this thing
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.080]   and here's the commands and da-da,
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.440]   and this is how it hot switches and everything.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.520]   He's like, that's never gonna work.
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.520]   I was like, what?
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:33.880]   It was never gonna work.
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.120]   I said, well, let me go over here
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.240]   and show you this right here.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.760]   I have it prototyped and it's been working for days.
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.120]   I just wanna see if you're gonna have it
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.000]   find any holes in the thing.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.280]   Didn't even, and he just stormed out of the room
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:47.880]   and never even, right? - Yeah, that's hilarious.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.760]   I've had a lot of experience like this with experts.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:53.260]   Like for example, this ridiculous room.
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:59.200]   I had a person, and there's many people like this,
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:02.220]   that I showed them, here's the situation.
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:04.960]   - For acoustics or something? - For acoustics, yeah.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.960]   They're like, no, no, no, no, no, this is horrible.
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.120]   (Luke laughing)
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.720]   This is not gonna work.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:15.480]   The reflection, the curtains are not gonna stop.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:19.440]   There's a bunch of terminology they're telling me.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:22.000]   It's a similar kind of situation as the idea,
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.400]   which I was like, no, listen.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.640]   I just need to see, is there major issues?
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:30.200]   And they're like a low-hanging fruit that are fixable
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.720]   and major holes I should be aware of, not like let's--
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:35.560]   - $100,000 to upgrade.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.320]   - To upgrade for what exact purpose?
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.360]   - What, not why.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.760]   Yeah, exactly, exactly, the why.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.680]   The focusing on the story, on the content,
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.760]   on the why, the why, the why.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.880]   And that actually, I've experienced that, unfortunately,
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:53.560]   in the artistic realms too, which is like photography
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:55.500]   and videography, cinematography.
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:58.640]   It's interesting, I talk to photographers
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:03.080]   that are quote-unquote experts, and it's always about,
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:08.040]   so much of the focus is on the equipment.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:12.520]   The equipment behind the sensors and the lighting.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:15.300]   And it's like, all right, all right.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:21.200]   But what about the feeling
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.120]   of the story you create visually?
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.080]   - The difference between a movie that's really well-told
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:33.040]   and it doesn't have all the effects and everything
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.200]   versus maybe some of the superhero movies
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:38.160]   we see all the time, which is, good luck if there's a story,
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:41.320]   but man, there's a lot of action and CGI.
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.600]   - Well, that's right.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.160]   And there's also value to those, right?
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.240]   CGI, superhero. - Oh, sure.
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.640]   Can tell a better story,
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.820]   but you have to have a good story to begin with.
[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:53.040]   - Sure, exactly.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.560]   But if you're focused on the story,
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:57.360]   I guess you need to start with a story.
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.800]   You need to start with a story.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.560]   And if you bring in experts,
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:06.560]   they can often be detrimental, I guess, to the why.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.080]   They're too good at doing the what.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:11.560]   - Well, you can bring in experts for why.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.840]   There's lots of experts for why.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.480]   Too many times we get experts for what.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.320]   - Yes.
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.200]   - And then they only focus on the what.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.680]   And so they come with the specs and feeds
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:24.120]   and the numbers and all the other stuff.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.400]   But what you're really asking for is,
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.680]   I need somebody about the why
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:29.280]   and understanding what we're trying to get done here
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:32.560]   and fitting the what's into that why, right?
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:37.560]   - That's why I do think that one of the qualities
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.800]   that I really enjoy for people to work with
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:41.840]   is like humility for a particular problem
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.100]   when you approach it.
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:45.540]   Basically, I don't know how to solve this,
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.320]   but we're going to figure it out,
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:51.040]   as opposed to, oh, I've solved this thing many, many times
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.480]   before I know exactly what to do.
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.760]   Humility before the chaos.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:59.240]   So having an open mind that this is going to require,
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.760]   a totally new way of doing things
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.600]   is a really nice quality to see.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.360]   You know, you're one of the fascinating humans
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.600]   in the history of Silicon Valley.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.400]   Steve is another one of those.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.840]   So those two humans came together for a time
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.200]   to work together.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.840]   What was it like working with Steve Jobs?
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.480]   What aspect of his behavior and personality,
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:24.440]   let's say, brought out the best in you?
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:27.320]   - Pushing you.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:28.580]   Really pushing you.
[01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:30.600]   Relentless on the details.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.840]   Challenging you for the right reasons.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.000]   It wasn't bullying.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.400]   It wasn't demeaning.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:39.080]   He would critique the work, not judge the person,
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.320]   at least not in front of them,
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.440]   or inside of a, you know, in front of a group
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.800]   or anything like that.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.840]   No, it was really that attention to detail.
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:50.280]   And when he would make a decision, you know,
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:52.720]   there are, when you make the first version of anything,
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:53.920]   something revolutionary,
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.520]   there are a lot of opinion-based decisions.
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.660]   And there's only one or two people,
[01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:01.580]   three people who hold those opinion-based decisions
[01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:03.020]   and what they should be.
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:06.640]   And when you have those opinions,
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:09.860]   and you're trying to work with a team
[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:13.700]   to implement those decisions,
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:16.860]   you have to really tell the why of those decisions.
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.860]   Just don't go do it, but why it's there.
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:23.760]   So you can feel part of that decision.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.020]   You can understand what were the trade-offs
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:31.100]   of the different other answers to that opinion, right?
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:35.220]   And say, this is the reason why we picked what we picked,
[01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:36.700]   because it's this for the customer,
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:38.780]   or this for the whole overall story, what have you,
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:40.940]   so that you felt really good.
[01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:42.220]   Because a lot of times,
[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:44.300]   most people want a data-driven decision.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:48.120]   But with V1s, you don't get data, right?
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.020]   Maybe in a B2B, you could a little bit,
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:51.300]   'cause you can talk to customers,
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:52.940]   but you can't do that with a consumer product.
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:57.060]   - V1, version one, B2B, business to business,
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:59.300]   versus what's the alternative?
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:01.180]   - Business to consumer, V1.
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:03.620]   - Okay, we're just defining some terms.
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:05.020]   (laughing)
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.380]   - Yes, sure, absolutely.
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:09.740]   - And when you say data-driven decisions versus what?
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:11.200]   - Opinion-based decisions.
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:14.440]   - So like gut, you have to use, you don't have any...
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:19.860]   - You can't fall back on any data or any previous history
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:23.100]   to kind of inform you of what's going on, right?
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:27.740]   And so if you look at most companies who are paralyzed
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:31.780]   and cannot make new innovations and new products,
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.540]   it's because they're trying to turn,
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:35.060]   and this is what I saw at Philips,
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:37.380]   they're trying to turn opinion-based decisions
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:40.740]   into data-driven decisions so they don't lose their jobs.
[01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:43.940]   So if you look at management consulting,
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:46.220]   management consulting is all about
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.500]   taking those opinion-based decisions,
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:51.020]   giving them to someone else to turn into data
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:52.940]   that comes back to them and says,
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:55.700]   they can blame the management consultants
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:59.120]   when something goes wrong, as opposed to, it wasn't me.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.140]   Right?
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:03.220]   When you need to have to tell that story,
[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:06.100]   you have to understand that, especially with V1,
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:10.700]   you need to be able to articulate those
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:14.300]   opinion-based decisions, and you need to own them.
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:18.060]   And if you fail with some of them, you didn't get it right,
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:21.540]   you then own them and fix them and move on, right?
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.980]   Version one of the iPod wasn't perfect.
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.940]   Version one of the iPhone wasn't perfect.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:28.380]   We got a lot of opinion-based decisions wrong.
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:31.980]   But as you go through, 'cause you got more data,
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:34.980]   'cause V2, you had data on those original opinions,
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:37.500]   and then you were able to then modulate off of that, right?
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.820]   And you'll still have new opinions
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:40.620]   because those are differentiators
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:42.620]   that we call differentiators,
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:47.620]   the things that move the product forward in its evolution.
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:51.700]   But at the revolution stage, opinions, opinions, opinions,
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:52.580]   no data.
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:55.620]   - And so you have this discussion, you and Steve,
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:24:00.620]   in the stage, and the whole team, with opinions.
[01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:04.300]   And there, you have to be harsh.
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.580]   (Luke laughs)
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:08.100]   - I wouldn't say harsh,
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:10.340]   but you have to be very determined, right?
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:13.260]   You know, there are two real opinion-based decisions
[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:15.260]   that happened on the iPhone.
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:18.060]   One was the keyboard.
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:19.740]   Should we have a hardboard keyboard,
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.460]   or should we have a virtual keyboard?
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:23.660]   The BlackBerry was the number one
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:26.860]   productivity messaging device of its time.
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:29.260]   It was called a CrackBerry for a reason,
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.980]   'cause people loved it, 'cause it was easy to type,
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:33.780]   and they could get their work done.
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:36.900]   But when you're saying, "We're gonna move from that,"
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:38.740]   everyone's talking about that in the market,
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:41.300]   and you say, "We're gonna move to a virtual keyboard,
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:44.780]   "and it's not gonna work as well as the hardware keyboard,"
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:46.940]   that's an opinion-based decision, right?
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:48.540]   Because the data is telling you,
[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:51.460]   all the best sales are over here.
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:53.180]   - God, that takes guts.
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:54.780]   - It takes guts, but you have to look at it
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:56.180]   from a different point of view.
[01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:59.380]   And this is how I learned to come to understand this,
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:02.380]   because I had been building virtual keyboards before,
[01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:06.540]   and I knew the goodness and the badness in them, right?
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:09.220]   But he was like, "Look, those are productivity devices.
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.820]   "Ours is born out of an entertainment device
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:14.820]   "and productivity, right?
[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:16.940]   "We need to show full-screen videos.
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:19.940]   "We are gonna have apps, or not apps, but our apps,
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:22.260]   "the Apple apps," 'cause there were no app store yet,
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:23.420]   "are gonna take over the whole screen.
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:25.420]   "You want a full-screen web browser.
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.580]   "You don't want one that's like half of the device
[01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:28.540]   "is just a keyboard.
[01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.500]   "Maybe you don't need that keyboard in every instance.
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.340]   "So we want that part of the screen to change
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:34.660]   "based on the tool you may need at the time,
[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:36.900]   "and maybe it's just full view, right?
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.060]   "So you have to go and understand
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:39.340]   "it's a different type of device,
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:40.580]   "just 'cause that's that,
[01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:42.180]   "and it's successful for that reason,
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.820]   "the Crackberry for the keyboard,
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:46.020]   "that's not the only thing you're gonna do with this device,
[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:47.860]   "'cause people only did messaging,
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.660]   "and maybe a few phone calls, right?
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:50.820]   "This was gonna be so much more.
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:53.340]   "It was gonna be an entertainment web browsing device.
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:55.500]   "So you wanted those tools to go away,
[01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:58.700]   "but it wouldn't be as good as the hardware keyboard.
[01:25:58.700 --> 01:25:59.740]   "So that's an opinion."
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:01.860]   Well, let me give you another opinion-based decision
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:03.860]   that got turned around before it shipped.
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:07.200]   Steve said, "No SIM slot.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.380]   "I don't want any slots.
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:10.420]   "We're gonna make it very pure."
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:13.140]   Johnny was like, "Of course, no slots."
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:13.980]   Johnny, yeah.
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:18.540]   We all looked around and go, "That doesn't work.
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:19.380]   "You can't do that.
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:20.300]   "Well, why does Verizon?"
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:21.180]   And then he would always,
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:22.460]   and this was the magic of Steve,
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:24.060]   like when you said, "No, that doesn't work,"
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:27.540]   he'd go, "Well, why does Verizon not have any SIM slots?"
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:29.300]   They showed that you can do a mobile phone
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:32.420]   with no SIM slot, and you're like, "Okay, here we go."
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:35.740]   And so a few days later, we come back with,
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:39.540]   so product marketing, voice of the customer,
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:41.500]   engineering, we all come back with all the data
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:46.260]   showing how many data networks and mobile networks
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:49.540]   required SIM cards versus did not,
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:50.620]   and what the trends were.
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:54.840]   And so we showed the data, and that killed the,
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.980]   or excuse me, brought back the SIM slot
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:59.280]   on the original iPhone, because we're like,
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.580]   'cause he was just like,
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:04.360]   "We're gonna tell AT&T to not use a SIM, right?
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.900]   "We're gonna just tell them to do it differently."
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:08.500]   But we were like, "If we want this thing
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.500]   "to go anywhere around the world,
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.260]   "you wanna put that friction in."
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:13.140]   People are gonna move from place to place.
[01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:15.420]   They have different SIMs because of the prices
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:16.260]   and all that stuff.
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:17.820]   We had to show all of that data,
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:20.980]   and then that opinion-based decision got turned
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.780]   into a data-driven decision,
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:25.500]   and the SIM slot obviously showed up.
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.580]   So those are two, at the very same time.
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:29.900]   - So interesting, yeah. - Right?
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:33.640]   Opinion can hold, and so can data overrule opinion
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:36.140]   when data does exist for a V1.
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.580]   - But at the end of the day,
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:40.500]   you don't know what the right answer is.
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:45.500]   So doing no SIM card slot may have been the right decision.
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:52.740]   We won't know, because maybe if that was the decision,
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:56.140]   then like many times throughout Apple's history,
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:28:01.140]   you basically change the tide of how technology is done.
[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:03.540]   - Absolutely. - You never know.
[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:05.180]   - Apple started Wi-Fi.
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:06.020]   People don't understand.
[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:06.860]   Wi-Fi came out of it.
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:08.780]   There was no Wi-Fi in 2001.
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:10.420]   Apple started Wi-Fi,
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:13.580]   and then everyone else got on board.
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.200]   If you look at now where we're going,
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.580]   we're going to phones without SIM slots,
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:18.940]   'cause we have eSIMs, right?
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:21.380]   And now the SIM slot's becoming legacy, legacy.
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.100]   It's a legacy port.
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:28.100]   That legacy port'll probably be gone by six, maybe 10 years.
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:29.500]   It'll be gone.
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.440]   I'm pretty sure of that,
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.700]   because it's so much easier for carriers.
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:35.940]   They don't have to have physical things to go out.
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:38.700]   So right now it's just the early days.
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:41.100]   But it will happen, and it will go its way.
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:43.180]   It'll fall away, but it will take time.
[01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:44.980]   You just couldn't do it back then.
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:47.140]   - So timing is essential here,
[01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:48.820]   but at the end of the day, it's opinions,
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:49.980]   and that's where the genius is.
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:52.160]   Sometimes the data tells you one thing,
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.940]   but the data at the end of the day does represent the past.
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:57.420]   - Exactly. - And the future
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:59.180]   may be different than the past.
[01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:00.620]   - Right.
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:03.620]   - Sometimes there's wisdom in the past,
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:06.660]   and sometimes it's actually representative
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:09.140]   of something that should be overcome,
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:12.340]   and progress looks like leaving that stuff behind.
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:15.460]   The headphone jack.
[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:16.640]   - Right.
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:20.220]   - I mean, that, when different folks were getting rid
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:24.900]   of the headphone jack, boy, I would love to be
[01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:28.060]   a fly on the wall of those discussions.
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:30.060]   - We had that, oh.
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:34.380]   - That was a discussion that happened almost every year.
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:36.060]   That was an every year, should we get rid
[01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:38.860]   of headphone jacks on the iPod, right?
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:41.460]   When are wireless headsets gonna happen, right?
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:44.520]   And it took years to build all the right protocols,
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.300]   the chips, all those things, to make the experience
[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:50.940]   that is the AirPods today, right?
[01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:53.620]   To say, have the confidence, 'cause Bluetooth was good,
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:55.680]   but it wasn't Apple-like.
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:57.460]   So now it's like, we gotta make our own chips,
[01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:59.020]   we gotta make our own software stacks.
[01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:02.020]   Now we have the confidence to remove the headphone jack
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:04.900]   and actually make you pay $200 more for your iPhone
[01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.360]   that you were just paying 'cause of the headphone jack.
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:10.460]   Now we've grown our revenue, we've given a new experience
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:11.960]   to the user, right?
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:15.700]   And ta-da, you know, and it's just, it's magic.
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:18.020]   And now the world's transformed to everyone,
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:19.980]   you know, moving to that, right?
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.920]   But it took years to understand the problem,
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:26.780]   develop the technology, and not just rush it to market,
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:28.940]   to get a half experience, but to get it right
[01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:31.060]   and refine it, then ship it.
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:33.740]   And only then, after, it was probably four or five years
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:38.020]   in development, just like the M1 processor, right?
[01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:42.080]   That was a work from 2008, right?
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:45.340]   Grinding away, grinding away, grinding away,
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:47.060]   then saying, okay, now we have the confidence
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:49.660]   we're doing our own silicon for all the iPhones
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:54.660]   and iPods and such.
[01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:56.180]   Now we're gonna turn to the Mac
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:58.220]   and make sure we have the best processor, right?
[01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:01.620]   Not just that we have the best integrated design team.
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:03.620]   And then, same, we're gonna, you know,
[01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:07.020]   and then besting everyone, making sure the software
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:09.460]   and the hardware is designed at the same time,
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:11.100]   making sure the kernels, all those things
[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:16.100]   are gonna use the best efficiency, and then popping it out.
[01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:19.400]   And then it feels seamless, it's magic.
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.940]   There were no, as far as I could tell,
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:23.680]   unless you were in real esoteric drivers
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:25.940]   or something like that, it just worked.
[01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:27.080]   It was magic.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.500]   Like the Transcend, it was not even a speed bump.
[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:31.300]   It was not even a crack in the road.
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:36.140]   - So perhaps famously, Steve had a bit of a temper.
[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:37.620]   - True. - Steve Jobs.
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:42.220]   Would you say his particular personality in this aspect
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:47.220]   was constructive or destructive in the process
[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:52.300]   of shaping these opinion-based ideas?
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:32:00.340]   - So in "Build," I write a chapter called "Assholes."
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:05.840]   - Yes, and you lay out beautifully the types of assholes,
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:09.520]   and maybe you could speak to the constructive
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:12.480]   and the destructive types of assholes.
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:16.120]   - Okay, so there's really two delineations
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:20.640]   that I have found of, you know, real fundamental ones,
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:23.340]   and that is, again, the why.
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:27.320]   Why do I feel this person is an asshole?
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.900]   Okay, they might not be.
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:32.660]   I feel this is a person who's an asshole.
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:36.860]   Are they motivated by their ego,
[01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:40.360]   or are they motivated by their mission,
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.200]   something they're trying to do
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:44.800]   and doing in service of something else, right?
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.100]   Sometimes those lines can be blurry,
[01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:48.800]   but it's usually pretty clear.
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:55.480]   When it's ego-motivated, it's clear they're just trying
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:59.640]   to get up in the ranks, push people down, shove people aside.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:02.560]   I think we saw a president do that on a stage once.
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:08.880]   You know, I'm me, and I'm the guy, right?
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:12.120]   And I'm gonna prove it by pushing everyone away
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:14.520]   and being nefarious or what have you,
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:18.120]   either passively aggressive or aggressively aggressive,
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:20.840]   what they're doing about themselves.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.560]   There's another one, which is someone
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:26.320]   who's so attentive to detail and unrelenting
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:30.280]   that they're trying to get the right things
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:33.640]   for the customer or in service of their mission,
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:37.760]   and they wanna make sure we fulfill those things, right?
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.020]   And they really care.
[01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:41.220]   They don't micromanage all the details,
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:44.220]   but they micromanage the details where the customer,
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:45.980]   it touches the customer in some way.
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:50.960]   People who work with those types of people
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:54.800]   who are unrelenting and push you and might make you upset,
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:57.960]   a lot of times it's a knee-jerk reaction to go,
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:59.280]   they are an asshole.
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:05.720]   Get off my back, you're an, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:06.560]   Right?
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:09.240]   And you're protecting your ego,
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:11.080]   because what's happening is that person
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.720]   is usually pushing you beyond your boundaries.
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:18.280]   They see something that we can do, or you can do,
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:21.000]   that you're just either not wanting to do for whatever
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.520]   reason, you're not confident in that,
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:26.160]   you're like, I don't wanna take the extra time,
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.920]   and saying, no, we need to get that done, and pushing you.
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:30.400]   Okay?
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:35.400]   And so when we came to those areas,
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:36.960]   it wasn't just a one-on-one,
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:39.040]   it could be Steve against the team going,
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:41.360]   we need glass instead of plastic
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.120]   on the front face of the iPhone.
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.480]   And we're going to do this.
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:48.000]   And we're like, God, you know?
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.520]   And so we did it.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:52.520]   And he pushed us because he didn't know all the details,
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:55.000]   but he could see in our minds that we're like,
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.560]   yeah, we could probably, yeah, we could probably,
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:59.600]   but man, it's really putting us at risk,
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.560]   and we laid out the risks for him.
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:03.640]   And he's like, I'm willing to take those risks.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:04.480]   We'll do that.
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:06.480]   We're like, we might be three months late.
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:09.840]   He's like, this is so important, we need to stay on time.
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:14.880]   But it would be all the time, push, push, push.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:18.440]   It reminds me of kids growing up, and me growing up,
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:21.720]   when your parents push you to make you grow
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:23.760]   beyond your boundaries, your personal boundaries,
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:25.760]   and you're like, God damn it, I'm sorry.
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:28.640]   But they do it for the right reasons.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.960]   Now, let's see, it's not bullying.
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:31.880]   It's not about bullying.
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.520]   It's not about demeaning.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:36.320]   It's about either pushing you to another part
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.520]   of the mission that needs to get done,
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:41.000]   or it's about critiquing your work, but not judging you.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.800]   - Yes, well, there's a lot to say there.
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:46.680]   So one, it's fascinating.
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:48.120]   It really is fascinating,
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:49.880]   and you laid out a very nice picture,
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:54.880]   but it does feel like there's sometimes gray areas,
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.120]   which is why it makes all of this very complicated.
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:58.480]   So one question I have for you
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.720]   in terms of glass on the iPhone,
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:08.040]   how important is it that, like Steve in that case, is right?
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:12.640]   'Cause I could argue each side.
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.840]   It seems like in one sense,
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:18.160]   just having a strong vision and opinion
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:20.760]   is already going to make everybody grow,
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.920]   even if it turns out to be the wrong.
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:25.840]   As long as you are sort of standing your ground,
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:30.680]   you know, Napoleon invading Russia or something
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.840]   in the winter, like it's just not gonna be a good idea.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:35.680]   - Right.
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:39.080]   - It's not a good idea, but I'm gonna hold to that.
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.640]   And then once you decide, you go all in.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:42.760]   And then from that,
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:45.120]   even if the whole team knows it's the wrong decision,
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:48.120]   just sticking by it, powering through,
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:50.360]   you will learn through the pain of it.
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:51.480]   Everybody will learn.
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:52.960]   So that's one side.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:57.960]   The other is maybe the asshole, the vision-driven asshole,
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:02.560]   gets to be more and more of an asshole
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:05.720]   if they have a track record of,
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:08.200]   through that process, having built people up,
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:10.440]   having made the correct decisions.
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.960]   They're not allowed to be an asshole.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.080]   - They're in rare air and no one can challenge them.
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.520]   - Right. - Right?
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:18.640]   Steve was never that.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:19.800]   That's the great thing.
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:22.640]   He was never unchallengeable.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:23.840]   You could challenge him.
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:28.840]   Now, the plastic to glass story is a perfect example of this.
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:33.120]   So at the beginning of the project,
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:35.040]   well before we were going,
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:37.120]   we had always had these things about, you know,
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:39.560]   plastic front iPods, these kinds of things,
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:41.520]   you have scratches and all that stuff.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:46.840]   So we said, "Are we gonna have a glass
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:50.200]   "or a plastic cover for the display?"
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:52.560]   'Cause the display was glass underneath it.
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:57.120]   We argued back and forth about glass versus plastic.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:00.720]   And then we all landed together on plastic.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:03.400]   Okay?
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:05.680]   The original decision was plastic.
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:07.440]   And the reasons were, okay,
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:10.360]   we don't wanna make a mistake, glass can break,
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:14.200]   you know, people drop them all the time.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:16.760]   So we don't wanna have a fragile device
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:20.000]   because you're gonna be using even more
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.400]   than a music player, right?
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.600]   And you're gonna be holding your head
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:27.760]   and putting in your pocket and misses and all that stuff.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:30.200]   So we went down the road with plastic.
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:33.640]   When it was shown, when the product was shown
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:38.640]   at Mac World in 2007, the first time, that was plastic.
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:44.800]   We had just enough of them in the field at the time.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:48.720]   We started to start seeing light scratches on the plastic.
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:53.240]   Reviewers who didn't have the device yet
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:54.600]   'cause it was behind glass.
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:58.120]   If you remember 2007, the Jesus phone comes up
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:38:59.440]   and no one could even touch them.
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:00.400]   You could just look at it
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:02.960]   in this beautiful museum quality box.
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:05.760]   Like it came from the future or whatever, the past.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.360]   It was like, oh, and you just looked
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.600]   and that was all you got.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:11.760]   But then people said, well, what screen is,
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:12.720]   what covers on that?
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:15.280]   You know, reviewers who knew better, you know,
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:16.320]   it's plastic.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.720]   And they were like, really?
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:21.000]   And so there was enough of a doubt there.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.400]   And then when we started to do it,
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:25.000]   and then Steve changed the frame of reference
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.560]   of the question or of the result
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.160]   of what the customer would think.
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:32.920]   And he was like, if we designed it with plastic
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:34.480]   and it's in their pocket all the time
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:37.040]   and it gets scratched by coins, lightly scratched
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:39.520]   or by keys or something like that,
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:41.720]   that is a design problem.
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:42.640]   We need to fix the problem.
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:44.240]   That was our bad.
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:49.760]   If they go off and drop it or even slightly drop it
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.560]   and it cracks, it's the customer's fault.
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:56.320]   And they have much lower,
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:59.040]   they have less likelihood to complain.
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.360]   Yes, they'll complain,
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:04.600]   but they're part of that failure.
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.720]   Yes, oh, that's fascinating.
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:07.680]   And then-
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:08.720]   There's truth to that.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:09.680]   Right?
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:11.960]   Because then they were part of why it failed.
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:13.800]   Whereas the design, they didn't do anything wrong.
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:14.880]   It was just sitting in their pocket
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.560]   and it's scratching, and that's normal use.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.000]   Abnormal use is a bad drop.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.240]   And we're like, oh, now we get it.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:26.040]   And so we all moved to that mindset
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.440]   when you framed the problem and the solution in that way
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:34.080]   versus the original framing where we all landed on plastic.
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:38.760]   And then he was unrelenting on that, but we all had moved.
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:42.800]   And we had moved mindset and we understood the why
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.680]   and we marshaled together.
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:48.880]   And then by the end of June, and it was crazy,
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.720]   the mechanical product design teams, sourcing,
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:55.520]   all of us, the partner Corning,
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.520]   pulled together to make that happen
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.320]   because it was the right reason.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:03.320]   So this, you look at these stories
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:07.040]   and you hear just the top line rumors of the takeaways,
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:09.160]   but that's not usually how it all happened.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:12.240]   Like one leader was, that's not how Steve was.
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:15.000]   Now I've seen leaders who are just pounding
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.160]   and just had no real empathy for the team
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.200]   and understanding the why.
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:21.120]   And it's just, it is the way I want it.
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:23.640]   I am the supreme leader.
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:24.760]   That wasn't like that.
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:27.640]   - He just had a very strong opinion.
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:29.320]   - Very strong opinion.
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:30.880]   - But it was challengeable.
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:31.800]   - It was challengeable.
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:34.260]   And if you came with the right thing,
[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:37.120]   you could modulate that, but you had to come with a team.
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.280]   It couldn't just be you.
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:41.600]   It had to become a team and data to overcome
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:43.240]   'cause it was a very strong opinion.
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:46.520]   - And there's personal quirks of character, like you said.
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:47.800]   - Bad days and good days.
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:48.640]   - Bad days and good days.
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:51.320]   So there's also the three options you said.
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:53.200]   You noticed that the third option
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.400]   is always going to be the one that's picked.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.240]   Those kinds of--
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:58.080]   - Idiosyncrasies.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.520]   - Idiosyncrasies.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.800]   And that, so that brings up another thing.
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:07.220]   You said challenge the idea, not the person.
[01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:13.480]   I'm somebody who has a, I have a temper.
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:15.520]   I use colorful language and so on.
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:17.240]   When I'm on teams, I work.
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:19.400]   In my private life, I'm much calmer and so on.
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:22.240]   But when I get really passionate with engineering teams--
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.520]   - Sure.
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:24.920]   I've been called an asshole.
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:27.040]   (laughing)
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:32.040]   - I mean, I am distinctly aware that you cross lines often.
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:35.760]   There's like levels, right?
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:36.680]   - Sure.
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:39.260]   - You know, you could, it has to do with language
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:41.100]   and how language is heard.
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:43.480]   So for example, you could say a lot of stuff to me.
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:44.520]   You could swear.
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:46.160]   You could say stuff that sounds personal.
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:51.160]   Like, I don't know, Lex, sometimes I think
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:54.400]   you're the dumbest human on the face of the earth
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:55.240]   or something, I don't know.
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:56.060]   - Yeah, sure, sure.
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:57.440]   - This sounds very personal, right?
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:58.880]   But I'm not gonna take that personally.
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.400]   I understand what's being said.
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:02.520]   And then I also notice that there's other people
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.160]   that take stuff more personally.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:05.000]   - Absolutely.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.200]   - This has to do with teams and figuring out like,
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:10.080]   okay, who's going to take certain words personally or not?
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:12.840]   And you have to know, that's what makes a great coach,
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:14.000]   a great leader, a mentor.
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:17.040]   You have to like factor all that in.
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:19.880]   But it just, there's something about just being an asshole
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:23.880]   and being passionate and really driven
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:27.020]   that sometimes you do cross lines.
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:30.360]   And that's, I don't know what to do with that
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.700]   because it feels like it comes with the territory.
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:36.320]   Like you have, it seems like you can't just have
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.920]   a perfectly optimized.
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:41.180]   - No, no, absolutely not.
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:42.080]   We're humans.
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:42.920]   - Yeah.
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:43.760]   - We're humans.
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:44.600]   We're humans.
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:45.420]   We're programmed, everyone's programmed the same way
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:48.120]   to react the same way to given stimulus, right?
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:48.960]   - Yeah.
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:53.400]   - So, you said, I don't know if this was a real example,
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:55.680]   but you said, oh, you're the dumbest human on earth
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:56.600]   or whatever.
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:58.600]   I would never say that.
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:00.000]   Absolutely never.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.520]   And if someone said that to me or I saw someone else
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:06.200]   say that to another person on the team, absolutely not.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.660]   That is not allowed because that's judging someone.
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.680]   You may be heated and you can get heated
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.800]   and you can say it in your intonation,
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:15.280]   but to then try to put a label on it
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:17.960]   and put a label on a person, that is not allowed.
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:20.560]   So, if you let that kind of culture happen
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:25.560]   and it becomes somewhat, you know, sometimes it's in jest.
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:28.040]   You know, it has to be very much in jest
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:29.080]   and those two people have to have
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:31.680]   a really good working relationship.
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:34.980]   But other than that, I'm sorry, it's gonna be a lot more,
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:38.120]   you could say, aseptic in that way
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:39.760]   that you're not gonna add that stuff in,
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:42.300]   but you can do it with all other types of ways
[01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:45.480]   without saying that because then people who do react
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:48.480]   to that kind of language and don't have those shields
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:51.720]   because they might not have that same confidence level
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:54.360]   that you do and you can just brush it off,
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:56.960]   that can be very cancerous in a team
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:58.960]   because people then mean that.
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:01.240]   And then they see, oh, that's the right way to be.
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:05.480]   You gotta snuff that out and you gotta be that change
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:08.000]   or that model that you wanna show the team.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:08.960]   - Yes, it's true.
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:10.640]   Even if it doesn't affect me,
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:14.200]   it's going to affect a significant enough fraction
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:17.480]   of brilliant people where that shouldn't be part
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:18.300]   of the culture.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:20.220]   - Exactly, and other people see that happen
[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:22.720]   and then, oh, I guess that's acceptable, right?
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:24.600]   Just like politics in the workplace,
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.120]   is that acceptable or not?
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:29.140]   I call it out exactly when I see it in front of everyone,
[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:32.800]   right, because it's just another ego-driven thing.
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:35.640]   You have to set the tone as a leader
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:37.580]   for what you want your organization to be
[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:39.840]   and how it gets reflected in the world.
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.200]   And you have to uphold that.
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:43.800]   And you can't, sure, you can have an excursion
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.180]   outside of that, but you have to go back and say, I'm sorry.
[01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:49.160]   - Yeah, yeah, go back to it.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:51.040]   - You have to go and apologize, heal,
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:53.720]   and say, I was not the person I wanted to be that day.
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:55.240]   I'm really sorry.
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:56.080]   - Yeah.
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:59.400]   - And even in front of the team and have that humility
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:00.800]   and say, we're all human here.
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:01.760]   And just 'cause I'm the leader
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:03.500]   doesn't mean I don't make mistakes.
[01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:06.640]   - So have the self-awareness, apologize.
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:07.800]   - Exactly.
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:10.260]   - And that's also part of the culture.
[01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:12.320]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:16.880]   - How are you different from Steve as a leader and designer?
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:20.320]   So you've spoken about sort of what made you strong,
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:22.160]   which is he was able to challenge,
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:26.060]   he was able to push you to bring out the best.
[01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:28.680]   - Well, I come from the technical angle, right?
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:33.240]   Deep technology, software, hardware, systems thinking,
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:34.560]   implementation, all that stuff.
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:36.280]   So I have a different bent.
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:38.800]   He wanted to be an engineer, started,
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:40.960]   but really he was much better at all the other things,
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:43.520]   the storytelling, the interfacing,
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:45.720]   and being the voice of the customer
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:47.960]   and being that product marketer in a way, right,
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:49.160]   that we talked about.
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:51.560]   I grew into being the product marketing, the marketing.
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.920]   He came really out the other way, right,
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:55.600]   and never got really deep technically.
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:57.600]   So that's two different mindsets.
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:00.160]   One's not better or worse, it's just, that's how it is.
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:02.400]   And it takes all kinds to,
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:05.040]   and all kinds can do great designs.
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.640]   - Did it manifest itself differently,
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:09.760]   just the fact that you came from those different places?
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:10.600]   - Absolutely.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:15.040]   - So like the discussion about glass on the iPhone
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.180]   was probably had a different flavor to it.
[01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:20.320]   - Sure, when you started getting into the technical details,
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:23.320]   enough so you're getting the third order technical details,
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:25.680]   and he can't argue with that anymore.
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:28.000]   Then with someone he's like, okay,
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.920]   at some point he's like, I can't win this war.
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:32.800]   And he learned that very early on
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:36.080]   'cause he didn't like the way the look of the Macintosh
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:39.560]   board, the PCB was laid out.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:41.560]   He wanted it to be beautiful on the outside
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:42.520]   and on the inside.
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:44.960]   He's like, why are all these wires running this way?
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:47.280]   Why doesn't it have all this symmetry
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:49.560]   and we have to make it beautiful on the inside.
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:52.160]   And even the traces on the boards
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:53.600]   have to look a certain way.
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:56.560]   So the teams made the board they knew that would work.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:59.720]   And then they made the board that the way Steve wanted it.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:01.000]   And that didn't work.
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:03.920]   And then Steve instantly figured out like at some point,
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:06.000]   don't micromanage every single detail.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.800]   There's some things he doesn't know enough about.
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:09.080]   And so he would get out of that.
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:11.240]   But that was one of those instances
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:13.340]   where he pushed really hard and that's his opinion.
[01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:14.520]   So they said, okay, we're gonna make it
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.720]   a data driven decision and we're gonna make both.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:19.000]   I'm gonna show you the results.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.480]   And then from there, he didn't get into those details.
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:23.960]   So from that, you could have a great challenge.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:26.720]   'Cause then you could get those data and say,
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:28.520]   we can't do that and let me show you why,
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:29.600]   or we can do that.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:31.120]   And then Steve would go, you can't do that.
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:32.040]   And you're like, oh, we can do that.
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:33.160]   Let me show you.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:34.840]   So there's certain times when you were like
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:36.440]   bringing something to reality
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:38.080]   that he didn't think could exist.
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:42.800]   So it was always that creative tension,
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:45.300]   that interaction that was so successful.
[01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:48.480]   I think, but there was one other fundamental thing
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:51.880]   that was different and that it graded on the team
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:56.520]   and that I made sure and I learned from to not do.
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:00.680]   And I over, maybe overdue now in the opposite direction,
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:04.680]   which is when there's a great idea that comes from the team,
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:07.880]   acknowledge that person and go, that is a great idea.
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:11.100]   As the leader, the opinion driven, that's a great idea.
[01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:11.960]   Let's build on that.
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:13.200]   Let's see if that can do that.
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:15.520]   Or it's a great idea, but not for now, put it aside.
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:17.920]   But call out when people have great ideas
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:19.400]   because it's infectious.
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:21.840]   And that means, maybe not ideas that come bubble up
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:24.480]   to the customer level, but inside the organization.
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:26.400]   People like, they get rewarded for their ideas
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:27.800]   and say, that's a great one.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:32.960]   Steve was always like, you give an idea
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:34.620]   and he would go, hmm, okay.
[01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:37.480]   I don't know.
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:39.040]   The next day, 24 hours later,
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:40.920]   it would come back with slight modifications.
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:43.320]   I've had this genius idea.
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:44.160]   Right?
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:46.840]   And sooner or later, we'd look around the table
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:49.320]   and we'd like roll our eyes and go, here we go again.
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:53.400]   - So it demotivates you from generating ideas a little bit.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.160]   - Well, we got used to it,
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:59.240]   but later on in the team, it was just not,
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:02.240]   it doesn't want to bring the best, right?
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:05.840]   'Cause if you're always like, the reaction is never,
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:07.680]   that's a genius idea.
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:11.360]   It was always like, it was either negative or neutral.
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.280]   Right?
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:15.920]   Then it doesn't have that same emotional effect
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:17.920]   that you want you to bring your best.
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:18.760]   - Yeah.
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:20.360]   Sometimes it's fun when people get excited about ideas.
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:21.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:23.880]   You kind of build on top excitement.
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:26.880]   But coupled with sort of harshness when the idea is bad
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:28.880]   and you call out the bad ideas too.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:30.840]   So it's the good and the bad.
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:33.960]   - Oh, you could say, you don't have to say bad idea.
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.600]   You say, maybe not now.
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:37.020]   Let's table that for later.
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:38.000]   Let's discuss it.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.600]   Or say, that's a decent idea,
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.160]   but did you think about that idea this way?
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:43.880]   Not just no or yes,
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:46.920]   but let's talk about why that might not be applicable
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:48.960]   in this case so that they can learn.
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:50.800]   So the next time they bring the next idea,
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:52.520]   they can modulate and understand
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:55.120]   and start seeing through the opinion-based decision makers
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:56.240]   or the database decision makers
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:59.560]   and bring better formatted arguments or ideas
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:02.440]   so that you have better chance of success the next time.
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:03.280]   - Yeah.
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:04.120]   - Right?
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:04.960]   You got to train through those moments.
[01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:07.200]   You got to teach those are teaching moments.
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:08.880]   - Yeah, teaching moments.
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:10.560]   I aspire to be that kind of person.
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:14.560]   I'll usually say that that idea is shit.
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.880]   That is the, like, and then you,
[01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:21.120]   that I remember that this brilliant person
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:23.120]   just gave that really shitty idea.
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:24.680]   So I remember to make sure the next time
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:27.160]   they give a good idea, I really compliment that good idea.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:28.000]   - Exactly.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.120]   - But I personally, I mean, it's emotion,
[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:34.680]   but I call out the really shitty ideas.
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:36.240]   - But you should call out the really great ones.
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:37.080]   - Yeah.
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:38.240]   - If you let the pendulum swing both ways,
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:39.680]   then everybody goes, he's balanced.
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:40.520]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:41.640]   - It's always one way.
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:42.480]   - That's right.
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:43.720]   - Why bring any idea?
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:45.160]   - I'm all about the pendulum.
[01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:46.360]   - Right.
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:49.540]   You got to have both, the joy and the pain.
[01:51:49.540 --> 01:51:51.260]   (laughing)
[01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:52.100]   - Don't just give me pain all the time.
[01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:53.900]   - The yang and the yang.
[01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:55.860]   So you mentioned the glass and the iPhone.
[01:51:55.860 --> 01:51:59.020]   So you wanted to, not just the iPod, not just Nest.
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:00.460]   You were one of the key figures
[01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:02.020]   in the creation of the iPhone.
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:03.740]   What's the interesting aspects?
[01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:05.500]   What's the good, the bad, and the ugly
[01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:07.440]   of the origin story of the iPhone?
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:13.060]   Again, this is a Netflix series that spans multiple seasons.
[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:14.500]   - Change my flight, please.
[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:18.340]   - Yeah, what wisdom, what interesting memories
[01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:19.460]   you have from the finding?
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:24.460]   So the pain and the joy that was foundational
[01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:30.860]   to the iPod, all the CDs you had to lug around.
[01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:36.380]   What was the pain and the joy and the vision
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:39.940]   of the iPhone in your mind, in the mind of the team,
[01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:42.120]   in Steve's mind, and so on?
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:44.420]   - Well, there's multiple pains.
[01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:46.500]   You have to also look, there's not just customer pain,
[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:47.760]   but there's business pain.
[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:52.540]   And it's about the, so Apple now is getting out
[01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:54.460]   of that place where it was in 2001.
[01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:56.540]   Now people are starting to pay attention.
[01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:58.500]   Apple's starting to get in the culture again.
[01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:00.200]   It's becoming relevant.
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:01.780]   Cash is starting to flow.
[01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:06.580]   iPod is 60% of that, of the revenue,
[01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:10.620]   total revenue of Apple, doing an 85% market share.
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:11.980]   You're starting to get a wind at your back.
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:13.100]   You got confidence.
[01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:15.980]   Like Apple had been beaten down since probably
[01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:18.780]   the first time the Mac was, since the Mac,
[01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:21.580]   it was a beaten company ever since the Mac.
[01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:25.380]   So we're talking 15 years at that point, right?
[01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:27.340]   This is the first time you're seeing,
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:30.960]   like, and Steve would proudly came in front of us and said,
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:34.540]   "Today I can tell you all of the employees,
[01:53:34.540 --> 01:53:36.000]   "we are now out of debt.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.300]   "We paid off our debt."
[01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:42.420]   It was a joyous moment for him, right?
[01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:45.860]   And then ultimately for our team, because no more debt.
[01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:47.740]   Wonderful, right?
[01:53:47.740 --> 01:53:50.540]   So now what you have is you have this successful thing,
[01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:52.420]   changing the face of Apple,
[01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:58.040]   and you hear these heavy stomping footsteps
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:59.900]   of the mobile phone industry.
[01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:01.060]   Boom.
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:03.380]   And it's the feature phones at that time.
[01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:04.560]   They're adding cameras.
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:06.260]   They're adding color displays.
[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:08.860]   They're seeing the success of the iPod and going,
[01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:10.860]   that's just music.
[01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:12.880]   We have some storage.
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:15.220]   We can load music on our phones
[01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:18.160]   and we can do what the iPod does plus more.
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:22.620]   Boom, boom, boom, right?
[01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:25.580]   And you're like, and how many hundreds of millions
[01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:27.180]   of them are being sold at that point?
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:28.940]   It wasn't billions yet, but it was still,
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:31.420]   you know, 100 million, 200 million a year.
[01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:32.460]   iPod hadn't gotten there.
[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:35.900]   It was 20, 40, 50 million, something like that.
[01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:38.700]   So now you're like, okay, what are we gonna do
[01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:41.300]   about this, you know, Goliath
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:44.660]   who wants to take our lunch, right?
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:46.540]   The schoolyard bully.
[01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:50.180]   And so there was one, let's partner with them.
[01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:54.340]   So iTunes music store was there.
[01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:57.020]   All of these phones are gonna need music.
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:00.780]   So they can come to the iTunes music store
[01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:02.240]   and get that music for those phones.
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.420]   'Cause it wasn't just about the hardware player
[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:05.380]   at that point.
[01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:07.620]   It was about the software that you need on the desktop
[01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:10.100]   and the content that you needed to download.
[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:12.340]   So now Apple had multiple legs of the stool
[01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:14.740]   as Steve would always refer to it.
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:16.700]   So now the mobile phone industry,
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:18.940]   okay, we're gonna work with them.
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:22.620]   They are going to make an iPod shuffle basically
[01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:27.140]   inside of a phone, can have 99 songs total.
[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:28.820]   And they're gonna come to our store
[01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:31.220]   and you're gonna, it's like, okay, great.
[01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:32.260]   It's all gonna be well and good.
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:35.060]   And that became the Motorola Rocker Project.
[01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:38.440]   It was Apple and Motorola getting together.
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:41.340]   There's gonna be software on this smartphone,
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:43.140]   or not smartphone, but feature phone
[01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:45.520]   to hook to iTunes to get your music.
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:47.780]   It wasn't even downloadable over a cloud or anything
[01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:49.220]   'cause that wasn't available yet.
[01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:51.620]   They didn't have data networks yet.
[01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:56.580]   It was a disaster from the beginning.
[01:55:56.580 --> 01:55:58.140]   Two different cultures,
[01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:00.340]   two different types of leadership styles,
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:03.420]   not necessarily the most competent engineers
[01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:06.060]   on the other side.
[01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:10.380]   And it turned out to be an absolute horrible disaster.
[01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:11.380]   I watched the pains,
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:12.780]   'cause luckily I didn't have to be part of it.
[01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:14.620]   I watched the pains on Jeff Robbins' face
[01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:15.500]   each time we would meet.
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:18.980]   And he would be like, "These guys are just,
[01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:20.620]   like, really?
[01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:21.940]   Do we have to do this, Steve?"
[01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:24.180]   And he's like, "We're contractually obligated."
[01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:26.700]   And when it came out on stage and Steve showed it,
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:28.780]   it was maybe a one minute.
[01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:31.580]   Steve loves those extended, like drawn up.
[01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:33.580]   It might've been a one minute, two minute kind of thing.
[01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:35.640]   And he literally threw that phone out of his hand
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:37.460]   as fast as he could, right?
[01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:38.740]   'Cause it was horrible.
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:41.540]   So there was the pain of, we're not gonna partner.
[01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:43.460]   So if we can't partner with these guys,
[01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:47.420]   we have to become one of them to actually compete,
[01:56:47.420 --> 01:56:49.860]   to save the thing that is bringing Apple
[01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:53.220]   from that 15 years of malaise, right?
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:59.800]   So then from that, we were made a prototype
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:03.380]   of an iPod plus phone, a classic with,
[01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:05.900]   it was an iPod, but it had a phone inside
[01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:07.780]   with all the music and all the other stuff.
[01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:11.620]   And you use your headset, wired headset to do the audio.
[01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:16.020]   There was another project at the same time,
[01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:20.180]   'cause we were doing videos in the iTunes music store,
[01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:23.580]   iTunes video store for music videos and movies.
[01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:27.160]   And it would be a full screen iPod.
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:30.220]   So instead of the classic, the way you know it,
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:32.180]   it would be full screen and it would have
[01:57:32.180 --> 01:57:34.060]   a virtual click wheel.
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:36.660]   It'd have a virtual, like single touch touchscreen
[01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:38.660]   that you could scroll, right?
[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:41.900]   Think of maybe an iPhone like you knew it, right?
[01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:44.220]   And then there was a third project going on,
[01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:46.340]   not in, those two were going on in my team,
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:48.900]   but the third project going on was
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:53.900]   the multi-touchscreen technology to drive a Mac tablet.
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:58:02.580]   And so that Mac tablet, that touchscreen technology,
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:04.380]   there was just way too much you had to change
[01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:08.380]   on the software and everything to be able to use a tablet.
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:09.740]   We see this all the time, like people are like,
[01:58:09.740 --> 01:58:11.220]   there's not enough tablet apps today
[01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:12.580]   that are modified for tablet.
[01:58:12.580 --> 01:58:14.820]   They're just phone apps that are grown up, right?
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:17.420]   So then there would just be Mac touch stuff.
[01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:20.220]   So you'd have to have a whole developer community.
[01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:21.660]   That probably wasn't the best place
[01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:23.480]   to take that technology first.
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:25.020]   So you take that technology,
[01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:26.820]   marry it with the full screen iPod
[01:58:26.820 --> 01:58:28.260]   and the phone stuff we were working,
[01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:30.940]   'cause the iPod phone with a rotary dial
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:32.500]   was just like a rotary phone.
[01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:35.820]   We couldn't make that interface work well for data input.
[01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:40.260]   You put those three together and now is where those,
[01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:43.860]   those three things that then created the form
[01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:46.220]   or the technology and the form inside
[01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:48.340]   what would become the iPhone,
[01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:51.700]   married with a bunch of low level software
[01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:54.460]   from the iPod and manufacturer software
[01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:57.340]   and drivers and communication stuff,
[01:58:57.340 --> 01:59:02.340]   combined with a very reduced Frankenstein Mac
[01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:05.900]   OS and I mean that in the best way.
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:08.980]   It means it wasn't Mac OS just changed a little.
[01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:11.460]   It was totally, things were hacked out and changed
[01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:13.260]   and new code was inserted.
[01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:16.500]   And it really was a whole set of things
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:20.420]   from all different places to make that first iPhone OS.
[01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:23.380]   And then there was another team working on the apps
[01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:24.980]   and then another team working on the design
[01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:27.580]   of how it looked overall between all that stuff.
[01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:29.380]   So all of those things came together
[01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:32.820]   to create what we know as the first generation iPhone.
[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:34.740]   - And those are all probably fascinating
[01:59:34.740 --> 01:59:36.100]   engineering challenges.
[01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:36.940]   - Correct.
[01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:41.380]   - And great teams like creating Frankenstein OS.
[01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:45.140]   That's fascinating 'cause you're simplifying, simplifying
[01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:47.180]   but then you're just pulling different stuff from
[01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:49.500]   and you're basically inventing,
[01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:51.220]   I mean they're probably not thinking of it that way
[01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:56.020]   but a new era of computing, a new kind of computer.
[01:59:56.020 --> 01:59:57.220]   It really is Frankenstein.
[01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:59.620]   - Right and you didn't have to run Mac software.
[01:59:59.620 --> 02:00:02.260]   If you look at some of the other smartphones of the time
[02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:04.940]   like Windows and stuff, they were like,
[02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:06.900]   we need to make sure it runs Excel
[02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:08.740]   and it runs Word or something like that
[02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:09.940]   in some reduced thing.
[02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:11.020]   This was like, no, no, no, no.
[02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:12.760]   This was born out of entertainment.
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:15.880]   So we didn't have to go and take all the same application.
[02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:19.240]   All those other ones was about compatibility.
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:21.780]   This was about a whole new way of being.
[02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:26.620]   - What did you think about the Steve Jobs presentation
[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:31.620]   of the iPhone, the sort of the first iPhone--
[02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:34.460]   - Phone, internet communicator and iPod in your pocket.
[02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:36.820]   - Yeah, they are going to sort of present,
[02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:41.340]   announcing three new products kind of thing
[02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:43.300]   and then saying that it's all in one.
[02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:44.940]   Just this is a good example,
[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:49.940]   one of the sort of historic presentations of a product.
[02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:55.060]   Clearly there's like some showmanship that works,
[02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:56.740]   some reason it works.
[02:00:56.740 --> 02:00:59.540]   It doesn't always work, it often doesn't work,
[02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:02.660]   but in this case, it often did for Steve.
[02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:04.920]   How did that feel?
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:08.360]   What part of the actually,
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:13.440]   the design process was that presentation?
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:14.280]   You know what I mean?
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:15.820]   Like from the early, 'cause you said,
[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:19.420]   so consider the why, the press release at the very beginning.
[02:01:19.420 --> 02:01:21.280]   - Steve was doing that the entire time.
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:24.580]   He was working on that story from day one.
[02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:27.140]   He was pitching us this, this, this, and then this,
[02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:29.300]   and then he would look at our faces,
[02:01:29.300 --> 02:01:31.380]   'cause you wouldn't, most people wouldn't,
[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:32.780]   at least if you're working for him,
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:34.260]   wouldn't tell him what you really thought
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:36.980]   of what he was saying, but he would look at your faces.
[02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:39.820]   And then he would talk to a few real trusted confidants
[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:44.820]   outside of the organization and see what they thought.
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:47.620]   And they could give him feedback on it
[02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:49.260]   and they could really challenge him,
[02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:51.500]   but he would also look at their faces and go, hmm.
[02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:53.860]   And so when you see that, hmm,
[02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:56.220]   then he would modulate it and change it slightly
[02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:57.060]   and change it.
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:59.060]   So he was working during all of that time
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:01.500]   on the story and the storytelling, right?
[02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:03.020]   And the whys.
[02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:04.900]   While we're working on that and helping us refine it,
[02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:08.560]   just like the switch from plastic to glass, right?
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:10.220]   All the time working on that.
[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:12.140]   So when he comes out on stage,
[02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:15.740]   he does something that every marketer is told not to do.
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:18.220]   Say, these three things are now combined in one.
[02:02:18.220 --> 02:02:23.060]   That is like the, they say that that is the laziest form
[02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:26.820]   of storytelling possible for marketing, right?
[02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:28.060]   - Yeah. - Right?
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:31.300]   But it was the best one because it was all those pains.
[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:35.340]   It was like, I want my iPod, but I want my communications
[02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:36.820]   and I want my internet browsing
[02:02:36.820 --> 02:02:38.900]   because I want it on the go so I can look up things
[02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:40.780]   'cause it was information.
[02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:42.860]   And when you were on the road, you had a laptop,
[02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:45.660]   you had an iPod and you had a phone
[02:02:45.660 --> 02:02:49.100]   and you had to carry all of these things with you at once.
[02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:51.680]   Now we're gonna solve that pain for you
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:52.980]   and put it all together.
[02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:54.460]   So he was just showing you the pain
[02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:55.900]   and beating that virus of doubt and going,
[02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:57.860]   it's now in this one magical thing.
[02:02:57.860 --> 02:03:00.820]   And he could come up and masterfully tell that story
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:03.700]   'cause he told it almost every day
[02:03:03.700 --> 02:03:06.900]   to all of these people inside very quietly.
[02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:09.340]   And then it was just, right?
[02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:12.460]   It was like a Tony award-winning play
[02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:14.700]   that had been worked on for 10 years.
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:17.020]   - But also the human came through, the timing.
[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:17.860]   - It was all that.
[02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:18.680]   It was all of it.
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:20.680]   And of course he was dramatic at certain points
[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:23.860]   and he would raise his voice and a wry smile
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:24.700]   or whatever it was.
[02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:25.540]   - Right, that wry smile was magic.
[02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:26.620]   - It was all those touches.
[02:03:26.620 --> 02:03:29.180]   He was an actor as well as a storyteller.
[02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:30.300]   - Yeah.
[02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:32.680]   - But it was the truth, right?
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:34.020]   The truth came through.
[02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:36.460]   It was a nonfiction story.
[02:03:36.460 --> 02:03:39.500]   And then he added those personal flourishes on top of it
[02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:41.160]   to dramatic effect.
[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:43.780]   It's amazing.
[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:50.300]   - So there's a designer you mentioned, Johnny Ive.
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:55.600]   You both are brilliant designers, great human beings.
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:59.200]   There were some battles fought in the distant past
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:00.560]   between the two of you.
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:04.080]   Looking back, what is the positive characteristics
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:07.160]   of Johnny that made you a better person and designer
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:08.320]   having worked with him?
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:17.760]   - Watching the process that the design team
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:18.920]   that Johnny led.
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:22.100]   I don't know where, 'cause that was over years.
[02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:23.500]   I didn't see all of those things.
[02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:26.240]   But watching the design process of really,
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:29.900]   'cause it was really a team that was about materials.
[02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:31.420]   It was about form.
[02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:32.700]   It was about colors.
[02:04:32.700 --> 02:04:35.660]   It was about these physical characteristics.
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:38.820]   When we talked about this earlier, it was design.
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:39.660]   What is design?
[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:41.080]   Design's everywhere, okay?
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:43.740]   So what they were really focused on was form,
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:47.740]   how the feel was, how it looked, the aesthetics,
[02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:49.160]   the physical aesthetics.
[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:53.240]   And watching, going through that process,
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:55.360]   I learned so much in that process
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:59.960]   about how to do colors, how to do materials,
[02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:04.960]   how to think deeply about curves, right, and shadows,
[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:10.080]   and how it would look not just in your hand,
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:12.160]   but how it would look in the photograph
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:14.880]   you were gonna take for marketing, right?
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:19.880]   - So how it would look, how you would feel, all of it.
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:23.660]   - It was all of those physical things around that
[02:05:23.660 --> 02:05:26.440]   and watching the process to get there,
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:31.220]   that was enlightening for me, right?
[02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:35.040]   It opened my mind to go, oh, okay.
[02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:37.240]   Just like there's a process for all these other things,
[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:39.840]   it wasn't just magic and you say,
[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:42.680]   ha ha, there it is.
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:44.820]   It was really a process of refinement.
[02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:46.760]   You know, of opening the funnel at the beginning
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:51.040]   and refining down over time to get to that final,
[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:53.560]   the final mile and selecting and doing the selection.
[02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:58.560]   And certain times there were opinion-based design details.
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:00.340]   - Yeah, color. - But a lot of data,
[02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:04.720]   a lot of data-driven designs of what can we deliver
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:06.640]   in volume, what can we do different things?
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:08.720]   So you always had these constraints
[02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:09.680]   that you had to work with under.
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:13.600]   And sometimes they and the team, not just I,
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:14.860]   would say, we need this.
[02:06:14.860 --> 02:06:16.900]   And we're like, we can't deliver that.
[02:06:16.900 --> 02:06:18.760]   But maybe we were able to work together
[02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:20.820]   to find different design characteristics
[02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:23.300]   and different implementation characteristics
[02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:25.520]   that could get to that point
[02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:27.520]   without what they were describing.
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:30.820]   And instead of yes, yes, yes, no, no, no,
[02:06:30.820 --> 02:06:34.540]   let's find some other way to solve the problem together.
[02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:39.540]   - Yeah, and I've seen this in several companies
[02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:41.780]   I've more closely interacted with,
[02:06:41.780 --> 02:06:43.480]   like Tesla is an example.
[02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:46.420]   Sometimes, talking about curves,
[02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:51.140]   sometimes it's very painful on the engineering side
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:55.400]   to deliver a very specific kind of thing.
[02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:59.100]   And one question that comes up in my mind is like,
[02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:02.940]   well, how far should we go to try to deliver
[02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:06.900]   a tiny adjustment in a curve, in the curvature,
[02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:10.420]   or in like whatever the form factor is
[02:07:10.420 --> 02:07:12.460]   in a color of the material,
[02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:15.580]   when the cost is like 10X to deliver,
[02:07:15.580 --> 02:07:17.780]   not financially, but just like in effort.
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:18.780]   - Yeah, personal cost to do it.
[02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:20.820]   - How many problems to have to solve?
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:26.420]   I don't know if you can say any wisdom to that,
[02:07:26.420 --> 02:07:29.220]   'cause when you're thinking about curves,
[02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:31.300]   you're designing in the space of ideas.
[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:34.380]   You're like platonic forms kind of thing.
[02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:37.680]   Not always grounded to like how much this is,
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:40.980]   how much pain is gonna be involved in delivering this.
[02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:44.220]   But that's as you should, perhaps,
[02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:47.380]   'cause then if you're always thinking about the pain
[02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:49.900]   required to deliver this thing,
[02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:51.220]   you'll be too conservative.
[02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:53.040]   You wouldn't do the wild ideas.
[02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:55.300]   - Right, exactly.
[02:07:55.300 --> 02:07:58.460]   But you have to understand, again, the why behind it.
[02:07:58.460 --> 02:08:01.680]   And at Nest, when we had limited resources,
[02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:04.660]   putting a screwdriver in the box,
[02:08:04.660 --> 02:08:07.540]   a custom-designed screwdriver in the box,
[02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:10.020]   was born out of those experiences I had at Apple,
[02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:14.220]   and seeing how you can create something that's emotional.
[02:08:14.220 --> 02:08:15.220]   It's part of marketing,
[02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:17.820]   and it's part of the product experience overall,
[02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:20.380]   even though it seems extraneous.
[02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:23.340]   I went back and made the design team,
[02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:25.740]   and the mechanical team change some curves
[02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:28.260]   on the Nest Protect, the smoke and CO detector
[02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:32.020]   we did at Nest, after they had already tooled it.
[02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:33.260]   And I said, "There's a cost more."
[02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:35.140]   I said, "It doesn't look right."
[02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:37.700]   But they're like, "Oh, well, we have."
[02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:39.220]   I said, "No, you're gonna go back,
[02:08:39.220 --> 02:08:40.400]   "and you're gonna make that change.
[02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:42.960]   "I told you we needed to do it.
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:44.260]   "We had a better-looking model.
[02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:45.500]   "That is gonna get done.
[02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:48.700]   "I know it's gonna be a terrible cost to you,
[02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:50.540]   "but we already had this discussion,
[02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:52.180]   "and that's the way it's gonna have to be.
[02:08:52.180 --> 02:08:55.140]   "And I'm sorry, but it is what it is."
[02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:58.940]   Because it's better for the customer,
[02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:00.100]   and it looks better, and the pictures,
[02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:00.940]   and all the other stuff.
[02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:02.260]   And then we did it, and it was great.
[02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:04.380]   And everyone agreed it was great at the end,
[02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:05.820]   but it was pain to get there.
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:09.200]   Those are where those little details
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:10.800]   are where the magic comes out.
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:16.880]   If you don't take those pains and put in the love,
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:18.360]   the customer's gonna feel,
[02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:20.840]   they're either gonna feel the pain,
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:23.880]   or they're gonna feel the love if you put it in.
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:27.040]   So it depends on how much time and effort
[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:28.440]   you wanna put into something,
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:30.200]   and what really matters to you,
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:32.560]   and so how you communicate what you do.
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:34.200]   - We're human beings, after all.
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:36.960]   Is there something you've learned
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:40.560]   from the tensions that are natural,
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:43.200]   or that happen in teams when they're passionate,
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:45.480]   and they're trying to solve these problems?
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:47.280]   Is that the way of life?
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:49.080]   And there's the human drama.
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:54.320]   Is that it is what it is?
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:56.040]   Does that make you better, actually,
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:58.920]   the drama, the tension between personalities,
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:00.280]   and all that kind of stuff?
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:04.520]   - Look, a rollercoaster ride without ups and downs
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:05.520]   is no fun.
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:08.040]   It's the journey.
[02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:12.160]   It's the journey that brings out the best in everyone.
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:17.240]   We're forged, we're tempered by those experiences.
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:19.800]   Not all the ups, but also the downs,
[02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:22.120]   and that's when you get the humanity and the connection,
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:24.080]   and we can tell these stories
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:26.920]   till we're blue in the face and smile every time
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:28.840]   because we did something together
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:30.680]   that each of us couldn't do apart,
[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:32.160]   but when it comes together,
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:34.040]   that's where all the emotions happen,
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.680]   and that's where, if it's born out of the right reasons,
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:38.560]   and the right story, and the right way,
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:40.160]   that's where the magic happens,
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:41.600]   not just for the customer,
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:45.400]   but for how it transforms each person who is working on it,
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:48.440]   and they will never forget those experiences in their life,
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:51.280]   positively and negatively, that happened at the time,
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:53.720]   but they look back, and it's only positive
[02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:55.760]   because they did something that mattered.
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:11:00.400]   - Yet another brilliant idea that you brought to life
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:05.400]   is Nest, Nest Thermostat, and the big umbrella of Nest.
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:13.120]   Again, as part of this Netflix series, season three,
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:17.840]   what was the most memorable, the most painful,
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:22.840]   the most insight-laden challenge you had to overcome
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:24.760]   to bring Nest to life?
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:31.360]   - Well, the first thing for me
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:35.540]   was making someone care about their thermostat.
[02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:39.560]   No one considers it.
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:41.640]   They never had any customer choice.
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:43.160]   They didn't install it.
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:44.460]   They usually don't even use it
[02:11:44.460 --> 02:11:46.520]   because it's so complicated or what have you.
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:48.760]   They just, they bitch at it.
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:50.480]   They hide it in the corner,
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:54.240]   and then they just pay the bill of whatever it is.
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:58.120]   It's totally unloved, unconsidered, right?
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:00.680]   So how do you wake up, like I said, the virus of doubt,
[02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:03.400]   how do you wake that up and get people going,
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:04.840]   remember every day when you go in,
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:06.560]   and it's like, you're just frustrated,
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:08.040]   and then you get the bill and you pay the bill,
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:10.020]   so you have to do that, so that was one thing.
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:12.960]   I think the other big one was not delivering,
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:14.040]   all of it was hard, right?
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:14.960]   It was constrained.
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:16.280]   We had only so much stuff.
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:17.700]   We were bootstrapped.
[02:12:17.700 --> 02:12:19.080]   We didn't have massive funding.
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:21.200]   We didn't get hundreds of millions of dollars,
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:22.340]   but we did it for the right reasons,
[02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:24.440]   but I think the other big part of it
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:27.720]   was not just building a disruptive product
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:29.680]   because a lot of the people on the team had done that.
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:31.040]   We knew what we were doing,
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:34.880]   and that was if we got the design right,
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:38.760]   we could deliver it with enough time.
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:42.940]   It was getting the disruptive go-to-market.
[02:12:42.940 --> 02:12:44.860]   In other words, how to take that product
[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:46.800]   from the end of the production line
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:49.400]   and get it into the customer's hands
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:53.780]   because there was no retail or customer choice
[02:12:53.780 --> 02:12:54.940]   in thermostats.
[02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:57.780]   No one even, it was never considered purchase.
[02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:00.060]   They never thought they had choice.
[02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:03.420]   Some guy, usually in suspenders and a butt crack,
[02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:07.140]   told them, looked around, looked at their house and said,
[02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:09.840]   "This looks like somebody who's got as well to do.
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:12.980]   "This thermostat is now gonna cost you $350.
[02:13:12.980 --> 02:13:14.580]   "Thank you very much."
[02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:17.060]   And you're like, "I'll take whatever you give me," right?
[02:13:17.060 --> 02:13:18.800]   And then, and it goes into another house
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:21.700]   that's worth $100, it was the same damn thing, right?
[02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:23.320]   So there was no price transparency.
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:24.380]   There was no choice.
[02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:26.660]   You just got what you were given.
[02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:30.760]   So how do you go, and this was an entrenched industry.
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:34.260]   That's why there was no innovation in it
[02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:35.580]   because it was doing just fine
[02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:37.780]   'cause every house needed them.
[02:13:37.780 --> 02:13:42.780]   All the installers were programmed by the product deliverers,
[02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:48.040]   by bonuses to say,
[02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:49.240]   "You're gonna only carry our product,
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:50.420]   "and if you sell this many,
[02:13:50.420 --> 02:13:53.620]   "you're gonna get a free trip to Hawaii," right?
[02:13:53.620 --> 02:13:54.680]   And for these guys who install,
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:58.160]   "I get a free trip to Hawaii," that's dream for them, right?
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:00.640]   So this whole channel was fully controlled
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:04.000]   by the product guys, and it was almost monopolistic in a way.
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.080]   So how do you go around that?
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:11.180]   So creating a disruptive go-to-market channel,
[02:14:11.180 --> 02:14:13.020]   one was direct to consumer, right?
[02:14:13.020 --> 02:14:15.660]   And all the marketing that was necessary
[02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:17.820]   to get that message across.
[02:14:17.820 --> 02:14:20.800]   Another one was getting the installation right.
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:24.460]   No one was self-installing thermostats.
[02:14:24.460 --> 02:14:27.260]   So how do we get enough people who are early adopters
[02:14:27.260 --> 02:14:30.580]   to be able to self-install them confidently
[02:14:30.580 --> 02:14:32.860]   so they didn't still have to call the guy
[02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:34.380]   to come and install it
[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:36.300]   because then he would say, "This is a crap product."
[02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:38.380]   No, I got the must-better product, right?
[02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:40.700]   So you had to get rid of that friction.
[02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:42.800]   And then ultimately, how do you get the people
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:44.400]   who were not just early adopters,
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:45.780]   but people who needed to see it
[02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:47.500]   and touch it before they bought it,
[02:14:47.500 --> 02:14:49.540]   how do you get that into retail
[02:14:49.540 --> 02:14:53.180]   when the large brands of the time of thermostats
[02:14:53.180 --> 02:14:55.700]   and Home Depot and Lowe's had contracts
[02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:58.500]   that they couldn't bring in any other brands?
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:00.340]   They were owning the channel all the way
[02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:04.260]   to where there was any sort of slight customer choice.
[02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:07.900]   And it was really contractor choice more than it was
[02:15:07.900 --> 02:15:09.300]   and consumer choice.
[02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:13.540]   So all of that had to be innovated along with the product.
[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:15.460]   And so to me, that was a huge challenge
[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:17.300]   and something I had never done,
[02:15:17.300 --> 02:15:18.460]   most of us had never done.
[02:15:18.460 --> 02:15:21.940]   And we had to create, that was as much as a project
[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:24.580]   as actually delivering the product itself.
[02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:28.440]   - So it turned out to be a giant hit.
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:30.940]   (laughing)
[02:15:30.940 --> 02:15:35.260]   And it was acquired by Google for $3.2 billion.
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:39.640]   As a founder and leader, just out of curiosity,
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:44.640]   in these cases of acquisition, is it always a good thing?
[02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:47.540]   Is there any part of you and the team
[02:15:47.540 --> 02:15:49.120]   that considered saying no?
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:53.760]   - We considered saying no all the way along the process.
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:56.680]   We had all been in big companies before.
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:16:01.040]   We knew what it was like and the politics
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:02.200]   and all the other stuff.
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:06.440]   And what I came to learn, especially from Phillips,
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:08.920]   'cause Phillips was a very, it was 375,000 people,
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:11.800]   it was a big, it was massive company, right?
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:13.360]   And tons of politics.
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:15.320]   And I was like, do we wanna go back into that world?
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:17.920]   'Cause I had so many negative experiences from that.
[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:22.280]   But then going to Apple, which was not big,
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:24.640]   but it was big enough that it could have all these dynamics.
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:26.580]   But then when you saw a leader rise up
[02:16:26.580 --> 02:16:28.240]   and get rid of those dynamics
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:31.360]   or not allow many of them to flourish,
[02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:34.960]   then you're like, oh, with the right leadership,
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:37.920]   this can be a beautiful marriage, right?
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:40.960]   And so for four months, we were working together with them,
[02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:43.920]   with Google, to make sure that we had the right leadership
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:45.600]   and we were gonna be in the right environment
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:46.720]   that it felt right.
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:50.040]   So that happened, it absolutely happened.
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:51.280]   We worked on all the details.
[02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:53.160]   We didn't even talk about price.
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:55.600]   We were talking about how's the brand gonna work?
[02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:56.720]   Who's the team gonna work with?
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:16:58.360]   How are we gonna get IP?
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:16:59.480]   How are we gonna do exchanges?
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:01.480]   How are we gonna get budgets and all that stuff done?
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:02.480]   So we worked through all of that
[02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:04.320]   before we actually sealed any kind of deal.
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:05.800]   'Cause they were already investor in the company.
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:08.360]   So we already knew, they knew relatively
[02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:12.000]   where the end point was for the price.
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.240]   So working through all those prerequisites,
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:20.120]   I knew that as a individual product company
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:22.800]   that was trying to create a platform,
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:25.120]   no investors were gonna invest in a platform
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:27.440]   that could take three, four years
[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:30.360]   and many, many hundreds of millions of dollars to build
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:33.680]   without all kinds of new products at the same time.
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:35.920]   And products that we were having, which were successes,
[02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:37.560]   but they weren't even break even yet, right?
[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:39.440]   We were still developing them.
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:41.960]   So how are we gonna get more people to fund
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:44.120]   all of these things and this platform
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:46.080]   that I really wanna create?
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:48.200]   Because my worry, and I had seen this many times
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:51.200]   in Silicon Valley, is these small startups have bravado.
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:54.600]   And they said, I'm gonna take on the big guys, right?
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:55.720]   With a platform.
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:59.000]   But when those platform guys show up
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.860]   and Apple says they're gonna get in the,
[02:18:00.860 --> 02:18:03.080]   at the time, nobody cared.
[02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:05.560]   They were curiously, "Guys, curious, what's next?"
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:06.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:07.960]   Apple wasn't in the market.
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:10.000]   Google wasn't in the market yet.
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.240]   Amazon wasn't there.
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:13.560]   Microsoft, Samsung, they were not,
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:16.400]   they were all just, "That's curious."
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:17.720]   Right?
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:18.540]   - Yeah.
[02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:19.880]   - And I had watched, if you said,
[02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:21.680]   "I'm gonna go challenge them
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:23.480]   "and I'm gonna build a platform."
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:25.220]   And then they all of a sudden, one by one go,
[02:18:25.220 --> 02:18:26.840]   "Oh, well, we're building a platform now.
[02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:27.880]   "We're building a platform."
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:30.680]   They fudded you to death, fear, uncertainty, doubt.
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:32.080]   And the developers run away
[02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:33.120]   and you can't make that platform.
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:36.440]   So I'm like, before the landscape gets changed on us,
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:37.960]   'cause we've attracted so much attention,
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:39.000]   they announced something,
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:42.440]   we need to change the landscape on them.
[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:45.160]   Let's go to the best place
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:47.100]   where we can build out the platform,
[02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:49.380]   have the right leadership behind us
[02:18:49.380 --> 02:18:52.480]   to help us grow this thing into what the vision it should be.
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:54.200]   And that's what we believe we were doing
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:55.800]   with the Google acquisition.
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:19:00.680]   - Is it possible to take on the platforms?
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:02.640]   So you said there's a lot of startups
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:04.880]   with bravado and all that kind of stuff.
[02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:07.880]   Doesn't mean, James Joyce, when he was 20,
[02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:11.460]   said, "I'm gonna be the greatest writer of the 20th century,"
[02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:14.700]   before he wrote anything of value.
[02:19:14.700 --> 02:19:17.600]   One of them might be actually right.
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:22.000]   Yeah, in this modern world, when you,
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:26.080]   so first of all, people should definitely get your book,
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:31.080]   "Build," it has just this giant number of advice
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:36.320]   on this exact question of how to build cool things,
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:37.800]   how to build a startup,
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:41.720]   how to all the different stages of that team and hiring.
[02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:43.100]   - It's mostly human nature.
[02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:46.360]   It's not technical, it's mostly human nature behind it.
[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:48.440]   - And it turns out it's, you know,
[02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:51.160]   turtles all the way down, that's human at the bottom.
[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:56.160]   Yes, so is it possible to build startups
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:58.800]   that take on the big guys,
[02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:01.160]   whatever that is of the modern era?
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:05.440]   So for now, it's these platforms of Apple, Google, Twitter,
[02:20:05.440 --> 02:20:08.480]   I don't even know, Meta, I guess, called now.
[02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:09.560]   - Sure.
[02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:11.360]   - Is it possible to take 'em on?
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:15.240]   - Absolutely, but you don't take 'em on on their same turf.
[02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:16.400]   You take 'em on on the turf
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:20.040]   they were gonna want to have in the future, right?
[02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:21.560]   Spotify is a platform.
[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:26.000]   It started as an application, is now a platform, right?
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:27.240]   Think of WeChat.
[02:20:27.240 --> 02:20:30.300]   Think of all the super apps out there
[02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:33.560]   that are now wallets and delivery services
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:37.240]   and travel services and transportation services
[02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:38.600]   all within an app.
[02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:39.440]   - Yeah.
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:40.880]   - They've innovated in a different level,
[02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:41.720]   in a different space
[02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:44.760]   that the platform companies weren't, right?
[02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:49.440]   Or they, you know, Google was an app company.
[02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:51.120]   It was solving search.
[02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:52.960]   And then it became a platform company.
[02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:55.200]   Apple was solving personal computing,
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:58.400]   and then it, or iPhone was doing, you know,
[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:01.320]   solving internet browsing, all that stuff.
[02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:03.120]   And then it became a platform company
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:04.400]   when the App Store was added.
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:06.480]   If you look it up, there's no such thing
[02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:07.640]   as building a platform company.
[02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:11.180]   You build a great app first, and then you can expand it
[02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:13.180]   and have the right to become a platform.
[02:21:13.180 --> 02:21:18.420]   - Your whole book is just a bunch of advice
[02:21:18.420 --> 02:21:20.040]   for young people, but let me ask--
[02:21:20.040 --> 02:21:20.960]   - And older people.
[02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:23.280]   - And older, well, everyone is young at heart.
[02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:24.120]   - Sure.
[02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:25.320]   - If you're not, you should be.
[02:21:25.320 --> 02:21:28.160]   So what, in terms of picking a career,
[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:29.720]   you have a device in this point,
[02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:32.440]   what advice would you give to a person
[02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:34.200]   on how to pick a career?
[02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:37.360]   - What is it you want to learn?
[02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:39.400]   And who is it you want to learn from?
[02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:41.100]   Just like you pick a university,
[02:21:41.100 --> 02:21:44.880]   you're like, I wanna go here for this expertise.
[02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:46.240]   I've heard about these programs,
[02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:49.900]   especially graduate, graduate studies.
[02:21:49.900 --> 02:21:52.680]   You go for a certain program with a certain set of people.
[02:21:52.680 --> 02:21:56.480]   Why don't you do that when it comes to a, you know, a job?
[02:21:56.480 --> 02:21:58.440]   You just don't go, or in a career,
[02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:00.920]   you just don't go and say, I just wanna go work at Google,
[02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:02.480]   or I just wanna work at Apple.
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:05.760]   You wanna go to a certain team with a certain set of people
[02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:07.280]   and work with them on something
[02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:10.480]   that you're really curious about and you wanna learn about.
[02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:13.000]   - That's such, I just wanted to comment that,
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:17.140]   that's such a, it's a subtle but a brilliant framing
[02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:21.220]   of just ask the question, what do I want to learn?
[02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:27.320]   And then see what career path is going to maximize that.
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:31.040]   That's so interesting.
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:34.040]   It's the first question I ask anyone who interviews with me.
[02:22:34.040 --> 02:22:36.720]   When I say I'm gonna bring somebody on the team,
[02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:39.600]   first question is, what do you wanna learn?
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:41.880]   I don't want the expert, like we talked about earlier,
[02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:43.600]   says, I'm the expert in this.
[02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:46.080]   You're gonna hire me as the expert.
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:47.640]   We're doing something new.
[02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:50.160]   You're not an expert 'cause we're not an expert either.
[02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:51.520]   What is it you wanna learn?
[02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:56.520]   And on the topic of learning,
[02:22:56.520 --> 02:23:00.640]   what is the best way to learn?
[02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:06.880]   What starting, you go into this new place,
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:10.680]   into this new world, into maybe V1,
[02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:12.240]   you said you're building V1.
[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:15.400]   I mean, the whole world is late,
[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:20.400]   it's full of V1s or V0s waiting for the V1 to come along.
[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:21.240]   - Zero to one.
[02:23:21.240 --> 02:23:22.080]   - Zero to one.
[02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:25.560]   What's the process of that look like?
[02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:28.000]   What's the process of learning?
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:29.880]   How do you learn?
[02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:31.720]   - Well, let me put a framing
[02:23:31.720 --> 02:23:34.520]   and then we'll talk about that last piece.
[02:23:34.520 --> 02:23:38.000]   I have now, looking back, especially writing this book,
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.920]   I have a version one of myself, a version two,
[02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:43.360]   a version three, a version four.
[02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:46.680]   I had a lot of opinions about myself
[02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:47.520]   and what I wanted to do.
[02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:50.240]   Sometimes those opinions for certain people,
[02:23:50.240 --> 02:23:52.120]   those opinions are formed
[02:23:52.120 --> 02:23:54.080]   and they get the data from their parents
[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:55.840]   and they go do what their parents told them to do
[02:23:55.840 --> 02:23:57.440]   or their surroundings.
[02:23:57.440 --> 02:23:59.600]   My opinions was like, I wanna go and learn this,
[02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:00.560]   I'm curious about that.
[02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:02.480]   I made the zero to one move.
[02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:06.960]   And then over time, by doing, I was refining those things
[02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:08.520]   and learning what I was really curious about
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:10.280]   and what I was really good about
[02:24:10.280 --> 02:24:12.000]   because I was getting data.
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.280]   And then I was like, then I had another set of opinions
[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:16.560]   to create version two of me.
[02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:17.560]   And then I would go and do it.
[02:24:17.560 --> 02:24:19.840]   So it was learning by doing.
[02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:21.080]   Starting with the opinion,
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:22.600]   you're not gonna get any facts.
[02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:24.200]   Most people are like,
[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:27.240]   where do I make the most money for my position?
[02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:29.000]   They're trying to start with data.
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.600]   Start with the why.
[02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:33.800]   What's your curiosity?
[02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:35.520]   What do you wanna learn?
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:37.360]   And then follow that.
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:42.360]   I took the lowest job on the totem pole at General Magic
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:43.560]   'cause I wanted to get in there
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:44.880]   to work with the right team.
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:47.640]   I didn't even know what they were doing.
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:49.600]   But I thought that it felt right.
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:54.160]   I was barely living above the poverty line working there,
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:57.920]   working 80 hours a week 'cause it was so amazing to learn,
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:24:59.360]   just like a college student.
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:00.600]   That's what I was doing.
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:03.800]   And then I learned more from that
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:06.200]   and then changed those opinions into data.
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:07.880]   And then I found other opinions.
[02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:09.360]   So it's the same thing.
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:10.520]   But it was by doing.
[02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:13.800]   The way you find out what you wanna do in life
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:16.680]   is by figuring out what you don't wanna do.
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:18.000]   And the only way you find that out
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:19.360]   is by doing a bunch of stuff.
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:21.800]   - Doing a bunch of stuff and refining it.
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:22.760]   - That's hilarious.
[02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:23.920]   Yeah, that's brilliant.
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:27.240]   So in terms of the career path
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:31.560]   of leaping into the startup world and launching a startup,
[02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:35.320]   what does it take to successfully found a startup,
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:37.760]   to have a chance to succeed?
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:42.760]   And maybe how do you decide to take that leap?
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:47.760]   Is there sort of having founded,
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:52.680]   having been part of many V1s,
[02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:55.680]   many of some of the most successful V1s ever,
[02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:58.920]   what's it take to take that leap?
[02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:01.120]   Maybe leave your job,
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:06.480]   cushy job at a company and do the startup.
[02:26:06.480 --> 02:26:07.480]   - What does it take?
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:10.880]   It takes belief in yourself.
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:12.400]   That's the first thing.
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:13.640]   Belief that you can do it.
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:17.600]   Not, but hopefully with mirrors or mentors around you
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:21.360]   or coaches around you to make sure you know you're not crazy.
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:24.080]   It's a crazy smart idea, but you're not crazy
[02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:26.120]   and you're just working on something
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:29.020]   as like a lone mad man or woman.
[02:26:29.020 --> 02:26:32.880]   You have a great idea.
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:34.860]   And like I said, great ideas chase you.
[02:26:34.860 --> 02:26:38.760]   In this world, there are so many people
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:41.720]   who have more ideas than they have time to implement.
[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:42.960]   I used to be like that.
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:44.800]   I would like, oh my God, I have this idea, this idea.
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:47.360]   And you try to do all of them.
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:48.720]   But the best ideas are the ones
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:50.280]   that you can really focus on.
[02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:52.280]   And you shut out all those other things
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:53.380]   and you bring them other ideas
[02:26:53.380 --> 02:26:54.940]   into the thing you're trying to do.
[02:26:54.940 --> 02:26:58.040]   So I try to run away from a great idea.
[02:26:58.040 --> 02:26:59.940]   And then it stalks me.
[02:26:59.940 --> 02:27:01.920]   It hunts you down because you're like,
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:03.560]   ah, that's gonna have this problem.
[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:05.320]   I'm gonna put it aside.
[02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:08.760]   And then all of a sudden, a few days later,
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:10.520]   oh, I think I know how to solve that problem.
[02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:11.720]   Or I talk to somebody.
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:13.560]   And you're just always kind of
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:15.480]   niggling around the edges of it.
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:17.200]   And then at some point, it's like,
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:19.760]   it just becomes like this black hole
[02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:20.680]   that just sucks you in.
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:23.320]   You're like, I can't think about anything else but this.
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:26.400]   It's almost like a relationship in the world, right?
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:27.680]   You know, when you have it with a,
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:29.600]   you find your partner.
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:33.120]   You know, you're like, hmm, hmm, Wade, hmm, something.
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:34.160]   And then you're trying to like,
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:35.780]   and then all of a sudden it just,
[02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:36.800]   it comes together, right?
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:37.800]   It's kind of like that.
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:39.000]   - Ultimately, it's you focus.
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:39.920]   See, I'm different.
[02:27:39.920 --> 02:27:41.320]   I just dive right in.
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:42.280]   - I used to do that too.
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:43.680]   I used to dive right in.
[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:44.520]   - Yeah.
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:45.360]   - But I learned that you need time.
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:47.360]   - It's more effective to run away from it.
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:48.360]   - Run away from it.
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:49.640]   And so it chases you
[02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:52.560]   because it makes you think harder about that story.
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:53.940]   - This is not dating advice.
[02:27:53.940 --> 02:27:54.780]   We're talking about startups.
[02:27:54.780 --> 02:27:55.920]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:27:55.920 --> 02:27:57.800]   (laughing)
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:02.800]   - But ultimately, so you have achieve, focus on it.
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:05.400]   But you also said, so believe in yourself.
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:06.920]   So it's not necessarily even the idea.
[02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:11.920]   It's the human that believe in the human being.
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:13.960]   - You have to believe in yourself
[02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:15.600]   and the idea that you have.
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:17.820]   'Cause if you don't have that belief,
[02:28:17.820 --> 02:28:20.480]   then you can't project that to other people
[02:28:20.480 --> 02:28:21.740]   to say, join the team.
[02:28:21.740 --> 02:28:26.920]   - Let me ask you, 'cause you mentioned mentors,
[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:29.320]   and you've talked about having had
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:30.800]   incredible mentors in your life.
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:34.660]   You're also a mentor to a very large number of people.
[02:28:34.660 --> 02:28:36.600]   What does it take to find a mentor?
[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:39.240]   How do you find a great mentor?
[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:41.800]   - Usually, they also find you.
[02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:44.440]   - Is it like with the ideas?
[02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:45.280]   (laughing)
[02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:46.880]   - No, no, no, no.
[02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:48.960]   No, what happens is you're in the right,
[02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:51.120]   you have a community around you, okay?
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:53.720]   And because you've been building a network,
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:55.120]   'cause you can't do it alone.
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:57.160]   So you have to create this network around you
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:28:59.480]   and of relationships that don't,
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:01.520]   not transactions, but relationships over time
[02:29:01.520 --> 02:29:04.920]   that you really cherish and people you talk to, okay?
[02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:09.560]   And you share vulnerable or nascent ideas with,
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:13.360]   or crazy opinions with, and then you argue them through.
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:18.360]   But you start to see resonate, and it's not about age.
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:20.640]   It's just about this connection, right?
[02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:23.000]   I have mentors, obviously, when I was young,
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.480]   all my mentors were older, and as I get older,
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:28.440]   I have mentors who are younger than me or the same age,
[02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:30.480]   right, they're not all just older, right?
[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:32.440]   And so it's about that connection.
[02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:35.040]   It's about being on that same wavelength.
[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:39.180]   But they also, they can counterbalance you.
[02:29:39.180 --> 02:29:41.200]   They compliment you in some way.
[02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:43.760]   Like my best mentors had nothing to do with technology.
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:46.680]   They didn't know anything about technology, right,
[02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:47.800]   the way we know it.
[02:29:47.800 --> 02:29:49.000]   They were all about human nature,
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:52.080]   and they could reflect that and help me get more human-focused
[02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:55.320]   and more empathetic because I was so detailed
[02:29:55.320 --> 02:29:58.840]   in the technology, I needed to see from other perspectives.
[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:01.200]   But then they wanted to learn more about the technology,
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:03.360]   right, or they thought that this idea was so great
[02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:04.840]   that it should exist.
[02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:06.720]   Now let's work together on that.
[02:30:06.720 --> 02:30:08.960]   So it's really, they have to find you,
[02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:11.720]   and you have to find them, and that's by sharing.
[02:30:11.720 --> 02:30:14.920]   You just don't go and look it up on the internet
[02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:16.760]   and say who are the best mentors in the world.
[02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:18.640]   It just doesn't work that way.
[02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:21.200]   - So form a network of people and see where,
[02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:24.040]   I mean, it's like finding relationships, finding love,
[02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:26.040]   all that kind of friendship. - Human natures.
[02:30:26.040 --> 02:30:29.860]   - Venture capitalists, money.
[02:30:29.860 --> 02:30:33.440]   Do VCs help or hurt a business in general?
[02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:35.680]   So like in those early stages in the chase
[02:30:35.680 --> 02:30:39.800]   of developing a V1, just what's the constructive
[02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:42.920]   and destructive power of money
[02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:45.360]   in the development of a brilliant idea
[02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:47.640]   and the deployment of a brilliant idea?
[02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:51.700]   - I have seen brilliant venture capitalists.
[02:30:51.700 --> 02:30:54.320]   I have seen horrible ones,
[02:30:54.320 --> 02:30:57.000]   ones that care about their LPs more
[02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.640]   than they care about the entrepreneurs.
[02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:02.000]   Of course, everyone's in it, at the end of the day,
[02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.560]   especially venture capital, they have to give a return
[02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:07.880]   to their limited partners, the people who invest in money,
[02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:10.400]   that they have to shepherd that money
[02:31:10.400 --> 02:31:13.020]   and make sure it's watched over properly.
[02:31:13.020 --> 02:31:15.560]   But when there's not a balance, a pushback
[02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:18.880]   in a venture capitalist between what the LP needs
[02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:21.400]   and what the entrepreneur needs,
[02:31:21.400 --> 02:31:24.040]   and that the entrepreneur might be trying really hard,
[02:31:24.040 --> 02:31:26.400]   but if they don't see, the VC doesn't see,
[02:31:26.400 --> 02:31:27.840]   the exit's gonna happen in two years,
[02:31:27.840 --> 02:31:30.400]   and they just leave them hanging.
[02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:33.720]   When it's, there's no, the value exchange is only money
[02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:37.300]   and not mentorship or ideas or other things.
[02:31:37.300 --> 02:31:40.840]   When there's not a relationship, but really a transaction,
[02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:43.640]   that's when money is toxic.
[02:31:43.640 --> 02:31:44.920]   Because you can get money everywhere.
[02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:47.000]   Maybe it's a little harder today, you know,
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.920]   over the last month, but you can still find people
[02:31:49.920 --> 02:31:54.560]   with money who are on that, who wanna enable your mission
[02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:58.040]   and can be mentors, not always, not all of them,
[02:31:58.040 --> 02:32:01.560]   but some of them can be mentors, but they're on your side,
[02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:03.520]   then it's incredibly powerful,
[02:32:03.520 --> 02:32:06.120]   because it's not just one plus one equals two, right?
[02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:07.640]   It's something bigger than that,
[02:32:07.640 --> 02:32:09.760]   because then they can bring their networks of people
[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:11.320]   and their networks of companies
[02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:12.720]   and other people they worked with
[02:32:12.720 --> 02:32:17.160]   that might wanna join your mission, right?
[02:32:17.160 --> 02:32:19.320]   That's the kind of venture capitalist
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:22.120]   and smart money that's out there, right?
[02:32:22.120 --> 02:32:23.960]   But you have to build a relationship.
[02:32:23.960 --> 02:32:25.960]   People go, "Oh, look at that valuation.
[02:32:25.960 --> 02:32:29.840]   "Oh, it's the brand name of the VC that's investing in me."
[02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:32.840]   No, it boils down to who's that partner
[02:32:32.840 --> 02:32:34.640]   and how experienced are they.
[02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:37.720]   Don't just give me the brand, give me the person,
[02:32:37.720 --> 02:32:40.040]   because that's the person I'm gonna be interacting with.
[02:32:40.040 --> 02:32:42.080]   - I have to, man, this is a million questions
[02:32:42.080 --> 02:32:43.840]   I wanna ask you, but-- - Season four.
[02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:46.800]   - We're on season five already.
[02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:49.200]   But let me ask you, it seems like,
[02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:51.720]   out of all the brilliant things you write about,
[02:32:51.720 --> 02:32:53.080]   it seems like not an important question,
[02:32:53.080 --> 02:32:55.400]   but it's a fascinating one to me, is lawyers.
[02:32:55.400 --> 02:32:56.440]   You write about this.
[02:32:56.440 --> 02:33:01.480]   Does a company need lawyers and why?
[02:33:01.480 --> 02:33:04.440]   And what kind?
[02:33:04.440 --> 02:33:07.840]   So you write about the value of this game, I guess.
[02:33:07.840 --> 02:33:09.200]   - Right, the legal game.
[02:33:09.200 --> 02:33:14.440]   - Why do we need lawyers?
[02:33:14.440 --> 02:33:16.160]   - You sound exasperated by lawyers.
[02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:18.160]   - I don't have a good question, I guess.
[02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:21.360]   Well, because-- - The why of lawyers.
[02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:23.200]   - The why of lawyers, yes, exactly.
[02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:25.040]   Okay, the why of lawyers.
[02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:26.400]   - Thank you.
[02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:27.640]   You even do the question.
[02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:29.960]   (laughing)
[02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:32.040]   - We just have to put why in front of everything you ask
[02:33:32.040 --> 02:33:33.240]   and then we'll be there.
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:34.880]   - Lawyers, why? - Why?
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:37.120]   - Even mafiosos had lawyers.
[02:33:37.120 --> 02:33:39.320]   (laughing)
[02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:44.320]   Okay, you know, Tony Soprano, you know, Scarface,
[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:47.000]   all of them had lawyers, right?
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:47.960]   Why?
[02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:49.720]   Because there are things in this world
[02:33:49.720 --> 02:33:53.320]   that you don't always consider in the government,
[02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:58.040]   in laws, in competitors,
[02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:00.360]   because you're so focused on what you're doing,
[02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:02.800]   they have to watch out for you, right?
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:05.720]   Now, the best kind of lawyers are the ones
[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:08.960]   who try to work with you to enable what you're doing
[02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:11.640]   and see gray areas.
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:15.360]   Law is not black or white, it's how it's interpreted, right?
[02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:17.680]   And so they can help interpret things a certain way
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:20.000]   or help push on things a certain way
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.440]   to get change to happen or allow change to happen.
[02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:24.080]   Because if you have lawyers who are always,
[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:26.480]   just like you were talking about PR people,
[02:34:26.480 --> 02:34:28.320]   if you have lawyers who are always saying no to everything,
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:30.760]   because their job is to really say no or maybe,
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:32.640]   they'll never say yes.
[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:35.080]   - And you also say their job is to say no
[02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:36.320]   and bill you by the hour.
[02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:38.360]   - Exactly, exactly.
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:39.560]   - Depressing. - Right?
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:42.360]   If you don't wanna know, don't ask 'em,
[02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:44.160]   'cause you're gonna get a no or maybe a maybe.
[02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:45.200]   - And you'll get charged for it.
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:47.640]   - And you'll get charged for it anyways, right?
[02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:52.320]   So to have a partner, to have them on your team,
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:54.960]   to help you see maybe some of the things you don't see,
[02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:58.160]   some consequences, they help to rein that in
[02:34:58.160 --> 02:35:00.080]   or change your language.
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:02.200]   Like, are you gonna get sued for this ad?
[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:06.040]   Just change this one word and it helps, right?
[02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:07.680]   So you need to have a partner.
[02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:10.800]   Most of the times, especially engineers or designers,
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:12.640]   they see lawyers as only stifling.
[02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:15.360]   Lawyers can actually, if you do it right
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:16.600]   and you have the right type,
[02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:18.960]   they can actually open up a whole new world for you
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:20.480]   because of the interpretation
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:22.360]   and how we go about doing things.
[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:25.480]   - And they help you not get bogged down
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:28.400]   in the pain of little mistakes that didn't mean anything.
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:29.760]   - Exactly, you shot yourself in the foot
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:30.600]   and you didn't even know it.
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:33.560]   You didn't even know you were carrying the gun.
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:36.680]   - Just to jump around, Charles Bukowski once wrote,
[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:39.720]   "Find what you love and let it kill you."
[02:35:39.720 --> 02:35:44.080]   So the question is about work-life balance.
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:46.520]   - That's like finding an idea and let it chase you.
[02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:48.600]   - Yes, but a little more aggressive.
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:54.320]   So what does work-life balance look like
[02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:59.320]   that maximizes success and/or happiness?
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:02.480]   Is there such a thing as work-life balance?
[02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:05.640]   Can you speak to this?
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:07.320]   - When your work is your life,
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:10.160]   and I mean that in the positive sense,
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:12.960]   when you're on a mission that really matters
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:15.880]   and you know that you can really affect,
[02:36:15.880 --> 02:36:18.040]   not just yourself, but other people's lives,
[02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:21.360]   and then that is very rewarding, right?
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:23.240]   That's not work.
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:25.240]   That's, like I said, a mission, right?
[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:27.320]   You adopt that.
[02:36:27.320 --> 02:36:30.200]   But that said, you still need to have boundaries yourself.
[02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:32.240]   At General Magic, wonderful documentary,
[02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:33.960]   if no one's seen it, you gotta see that.
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:35.080]   It's amazing.
[02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:37.240]   I was physically and mentally unhealthy,
[02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:38.640]   socially unhealthy as well,
[02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:42.040]   because I put every waking minute into this thing,
[02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:44.600]   every ounce of me into it.
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:48.840]   And when it was a spectacular disaster,
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:51.120]   we were making the iPhone 15 years too early,
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:53.960]   the bottom fell out.
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:55.640]   I had nothing left.
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:36:59.760]   I had to get healthy socially, emotionally, physically
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:03.160]   after that trauma.
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:04.480]   I let everything go.
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:06.880]   I learned from that that you have to,
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:09.520]   even though you might put everything into your work,
[02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:11.800]   you need to find balance outside of it.
[02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:14.160]   Now, that doesn't mean you're always,
[02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:17.880]   it's three days a week working and four days a week
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:19.120]   or whatever it was.
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:21.240]   You're still working as hard as ever,
[02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:23.280]   but what you're doing is you're making sure
[02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:26.040]   when your thinking time is during work,
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:28.120]   that you're not ruminating at three in the morning.
[02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:31.320]   You use the tools that you have to put those ideas
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:34.240]   into databases or on pages or somewhere else
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:36.520]   so you can go back and look at them.
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:37.960]   So you're not always having to remember,
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:38.960]   'cause what happens is most people
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:40.360]   don't write this stuff down.
[02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:41.840]   So they just sit here and I gotta remember this,
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:43.880]   I gotta remember this, I gotta remember this.
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:45.480]   If you just put it into the tools
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:48.040]   and you can come back to it, you can come back fresh.
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:49.680]   A lot of the time is about ruminating
[02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:52.720]   about what I need to get done and remembering everything
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:54.300]   instead of doing the work.
[02:37:54.300 --> 02:37:56.400]   - That's fascinating.
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:58.080]   So if you just put it down on paper,
[02:37:58.080 --> 02:37:59.960]   you can actually escape it.
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:00.800]   - Right.
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:03.160]   - Escape it for a time, to have peace for a time.
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:08.160]   You mentioned general magic.
[02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:10.600]   Let me ask you the Russian question.
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:13.200]   - The Russian question.
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:18.200]   - What's been the darkest moments of your life?
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:21.600]   Where are some of the darkest places
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:22.840]   you've got in your mind?
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:26.000]   You've talked about if you're doing these kinds of things
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.920]   with startups, you're gonna have to face a crisis.
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:29.760]   - Right, absolutely.
[02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:31.360]   - If you're doing it right, you're gonna face it.
[02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:36.040]   So for you personally, where were some of the tougher moments
[02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:37.400]   in your life?
[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:42.160]   - Growing up, I went to 12 schools in 15 years.
[02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:45.360]   I was always the new kid.
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:49.240]   Put yourself in those shoes, right?
[02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:50.080]   - You picked on?
[02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:53.600]   - Well, absolutely, but even more so,
[02:38:53.600 --> 02:38:55.680]   I was the geek with the computer.
[02:38:55.680 --> 02:38:57.320]   Remember the nerds in the '80s?
[02:38:57.320 --> 02:38:59.480]   You probably don't know this, but believe me,
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:01.140]   we were made fun of.
[02:39:01.140 --> 02:39:02.800]   What were these computers?
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:03.640]   What were these things?
[02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:04.920]   You're off in a cold.
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:07.400]   They're all up partying or going, whatever it was,
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:09.280]   and I'm sitting there like, "Bleh."
[02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:11.920]   They're like, "This guy is just this alien."
[02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:12.760]   Right?
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:14.320]   "Who's this new guy who just showed up?"
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:18.000]   And then you would ask the smart questions,
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.280]   and you couldn't be the smartest,
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:22.600]   'cause then you'd get picked on too.
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:23.720]   And you're the new kid.
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:26.320]   So you're in this environment that's ever-changing.
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:29.840]   You don't fit in, and you are just asking questions
[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:32.520]   because you think they're the right questions to answer,
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:34.400]   but then they're like, "You're making us look bad.
[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:35.460]   "Don't ask these smart questions
[02:39:35.460 --> 02:39:37.240]   "'cause you're gonna make us do more work."
[02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:40.620]   So right there, it's pretty tough,
[02:39:40.620 --> 02:39:41.840]   and I'm moving cities, right?
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:42.880]   And I didn't have the internet
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:44.120]   to stay connected to people.
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:45.960]   There was no internet.
[02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:47.680]   Phone calls were $2 a minute.
[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:49.360]   - So it was lonely too.
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:51.760]   - It was lonely, right?
[02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:52.580]   Right?
[02:39:52.580 --> 02:39:54.920]   I was a latchkey kid, right?
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:56.960]   I had my brother, but he was a skateboarder,
[02:39:56.960 --> 02:40:00.640]   and he had a different social way of working.
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:02.460]   He loved to do that stuff and be outside.
[02:40:02.460 --> 02:40:03.520]   I loved the computer.
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:06.640]   - So even in the computer, you were alone in the family.
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:09.080]   With the computer in the family, you were alone?
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:09.920]   - I was absolutely alone.
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:10.740]   That was just me.
[02:40:10.740 --> 02:40:15.320]   And then you could find the other geeks, right?
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:16.520]   But there were just a few of us,
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:18.520]   and we made this little thing.
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:20.240]   But then when you moved away,
[02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:23.920]   then I had to use a BBS, a bulletin board system,
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:25.020]   and a dial-up modem.
[02:40:25.020 --> 02:40:28.000]   And then I started hacking the phone system
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:32.040]   to get free codes on MCI and Sprint back in the day
[02:40:32.040 --> 02:40:33.320]   to get long distance,
[02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:35.200]   to get free codes to call my friends,
[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:37.160]   the geeks on the other side, right?
[02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:39.360]   Or to dial into a BBS cheaply
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:41.260]   that was in another part of the world.
[02:40:41.260 --> 02:40:43.660]   So this was this subculture,
[02:40:43.660 --> 02:40:45.420]   and that was not accepted in any way,
[02:40:45.420 --> 02:40:47.180]   and not the heroes that you see today
[02:40:47.180 --> 02:40:51.400]   that are on the richest people in the world and everything.
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:54.300]   So that was the first set of trauma.
[02:40:54.300 --> 02:40:56.700]   And then the next one really was general magic,
[02:40:56.700 --> 02:40:59.140]   you know, the end of that, like I described before,
[02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:01.880]   and pulling yourself out and going just,
[02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:04.020]   'cause I got so insular in that world
[02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:07.120]   of geeking out and building stuff
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:09.760]   that I just tore all the social ties, right?
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:12.980]   Because it was just, it was a drug.
[02:41:12.980 --> 02:41:15.480]   I was hooked on the drug, I was a junkie.
[02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:17.980]   I had to get clean.
[02:41:17.980 --> 02:41:19.440]   - Yeah.
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:23.820]   And that made you who you are.
[02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:24.860]   - Tempered, tempered.
[02:41:24.860 --> 02:41:31.340]   - So Steve Jobs is no longer with us.
[02:41:31.340 --> 02:41:36.340]   One day you also will no longer be with us.
[02:41:36.340 --> 02:41:39.740]   That's the thing about this life, it ends.
[02:41:39.740 --> 02:41:40.580]   - Yeah.
[02:41:40.580 --> 02:41:43.880]   - So no matter how many incredible things
[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:44.960]   you brought to this world,
[02:41:44.960 --> 02:41:46.960]   no matter how many inventions you built,
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:49.580]   you too shall perish.
[02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:51.580]   Do you think about this?
[02:41:51.580 --> 02:41:53.680]   Are you afraid of your death?
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:59.240]   - I am not afraid of my death.
[02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:02.460]   I am an atheist,
[02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:06.860]   and I think about the soul.
[02:42:06.860 --> 02:42:08.500]   Because I do, even though I'm an atheist,
[02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:09.400]   I think about the soul.
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:14.180]   And the soul is the thing that you instill in others
[02:42:14.180 --> 02:42:16.060]   when you go that lives on.
[02:42:16.060 --> 02:42:20.580]   It's not this thing that's magically in space.
[02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:23.420]   It's the thing that you've imparted onto people
[02:42:23.420 --> 02:42:26.620]   that you worked with and those relationships you've had.
[02:42:26.620 --> 02:42:31.420]   And that soul lives on in the stories that they tell, right?
[02:42:31.420 --> 02:42:34.140]   And through Build, I'm hopeful that those stories
[02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:36.660]   stay relevant because they're human nature.
[02:42:36.660 --> 02:42:39.340]   They're not about who knows what the next iPhone thing is
[02:42:39.340 --> 02:42:40.740]   or the next iPod thing is.
[02:42:40.740 --> 02:42:43.900]   The stuff that I have been able,
[02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:46.700]   the privilege to make and work with people,
[02:42:46.700 --> 02:42:48.580]   those are all ephemeral.
[02:42:48.580 --> 02:42:49.820]   The iPod's gone now, right?
[02:42:49.820 --> 02:42:52.300]   This week it was announced, iPod's dead.
[02:42:52.300 --> 02:42:54.380]   - And they're out. - After 21 years.
[02:42:54.380 --> 02:42:59.200]   It is that, those human connections,
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:00.900]   it's that growth that you've helped someone
[02:43:00.900 --> 02:43:02.540]   just like they helped me.
[02:43:02.540 --> 02:43:05.000]   Just like Bill Campbell or Steve Jobs is gone,
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.020]   but they made me be better.
[02:43:07.020 --> 02:43:09.140]   That's the soul that I believe in.
[02:43:09.140 --> 02:43:11.400]   - That's fascinating that you say that.
[02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:14.340]   Yeah, so many of these products,
[02:43:14.340 --> 02:43:16.140]   I mean, to push back a little bit,
[02:43:16.140 --> 02:43:18.580]   so even though the iPod is an end of an era.
[02:43:18.580 --> 02:43:21.040]   - Using it every day.
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:25.880]   - I think that, I mean, the number of people that impact it,
[02:43:26.860 --> 02:43:31.860]   it's just, so I suppose the soul is carried by the people.
[02:43:31.860 --> 02:43:33.060]   - Exactly.
[02:43:33.060 --> 02:43:34.780]   - Sometimes the products you create
[02:43:34.780 --> 02:43:36.580]   is the sort of the transport mechanism.
[02:43:36.580 --> 02:43:38.780]   - It's the vessel.
[02:43:38.780 --> 02:43:41.420]   And they felt the love and they felt that love
[02:43:41.420 --> 02:43:42.420]   and it transformed them,
[02:43:42.420 --> 02:43:44.500]   even if they don't have the vessel anymore.
[02:43:44.500 --> 02:43:46.780]   - Yeah, and in that way, the soul lives on.
[02:43:46.780 --> 02:43:48.820]   - Just like the body is the vessel.
[02:43:48.820 --> 02:43:50.260]   - That's beautifully put.
[02:43:50.260 --> 02:43:52.180]   Why do you think we're here?
[02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:53.820]   What's the meaning of life, Tony?
[02:43:55.620 --> 02:43:59.020]   - Jesus, man, death, we're going all around.
[02:43:59.020 --> 02:44:00.020]   Meaning of life?
[02:44:00.020 --> 02:44:01.060]   - Why, why?
[02:44:01.060 --> 02:44:03.760]   'Cause you said it's important to have a press release.
[02:44:03.760 --> 02:44:06.420]   (both laughing)
[02:44:06.420 --> 02:44:11.780]   Humanity, life on Earth, if this thing, the consciousness,
[02:44:11.780 --> 02:44:16.780]   the falling in love and building bridges and iPods
[02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:22.060]   and rockets and trying to extend out into the cosmos, why?
[02:44:22.060 --> 02:44:23.660]   Why do you think we're doing it?
[02:44:24.660 --> 02:44:25.780]   (sighs)
[02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:27.660]   Is there any meaning to it?
[02:44:27.660 --> 02:44:29.780]   - We are naturally curious.
[02:44:29.780 --> 02:44:35.100]   We are naturally curious individuals.
[02:44:35.100 --> 02:44:39.100]   And we are always looking for meaning.
[02:44:39.100 --> 02:44:42.860]   We're always trying to ascribe meaning to something
[02:44:42.860 --> 02:44:46.420]   or understanding of something, right?
[02:44:46.420 --> 02:44:49.780]   And through that, it's just like evolution, right?
[02:44:49.780 --> 02:44:51.540]   In Darwinism, it's just that thing
[02:44:51.540 --> 02:44:55.380]   that's baked into our being at the most fundamental level.
[02:44:55.380 --> 02:44:56.820]   - Driven by curiosity.
[02:44:56.820 --> 02:44:58.740]   - Driven by curiosity.
[02:44:58.740 --> 02:45:01.420]   - You're creating some pretty cool things along the way.
[02:45:01.420 --> 02:45:03.540]   Tony, and speaking of cool things,
[02:45:03.540 --> 02:45:06.960]   you've created some of the coolest things ever.
[02:45:06.960 --> 02:45:09.500]   And on top of that, you're just an amazing human being.
[02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:11.700]   It's a huge honor that you would sit and talk to me today.
[02:45:11.700 --> 02:45:12.820]   This is fun.
[02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:14.380]   - Lex, this is great.
[02:45:14.380 --> 02:45:17.340]   I didn't know where we was going, and I'm,
[02:45:17.340 --> 02:45:18.940]   let's talk, I'm looking for seasons.
[02:45:18.940 --> 02:45:19.780]   - I would love to.
[02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:21.100]   - Seven, eight, nine. - Six, seven, yes.
[02:45:21.100 --> 02:45:22.900]   - So hang out and have dinner
[02:45:22.900 --> 02:45:25.300]   and just rap about all kinds of crazy.
[02:45:25.300 --> 02:45:26.540]   I'd love to continue this.
[02:45:26.540 --> 02:45:27.380]   - I would too.
[02:45:27.380 --> 02:45:28.200]   Thank you so much, Tony.
[02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:29.620]   - Thanks, man.
[02:45:29.620 --> 02:45:31.060]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:45:31.060 --> 02:45:32.420]   with Tony Fadell.
[02:45:32.420 --> 02:45:33.920]   To support this podcast,
[02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:37.020]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:45:37.020 --> 02:45:39.040]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:41.180]   from Tony Fadell himself.
[02:45:41.180 --> 02:45:43.740]   "The most wonderful part of building something together
[02:45:43.740 --> 02:45:46.740]   with a team is that you're walking side by side
[02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:48.380]   with other people.
[02:45:48.380 --> 02:45:49.940]   You're all looking at your feet
[02:45:49.940 --> 02:45:52.580]   and scanning the horizon at the same time.
[02:45:52.580 --> 02:45:54.700]   Some people will see things you can't,
[02:45:54.700 --> 02:45:58.540]   and you will see things that are invisible to everyone else.
[02:45:58.540 --> 02:46:00.180]   So don't think doing the work
[02:46:00.180 --> 02:46:02.820]   just means locking yourself into a room.
[02:46:02.820 --> 02:46:05.340]   A huge part of it is walking with your team.
[02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:09.260]   The work is reaching your destination together
[02:46:09.260 --> 02:46:11.360]   or finding a new destination
[02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:13.340]   and bringing the team with you."
[02:46:13.340 --> 02:46:17.540]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:46:17.540 --> 02:46:20.120]   (upbeat music)
[02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:22.700]   (upbeat music)
[02:46:22.700 --> 02:46:32.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
