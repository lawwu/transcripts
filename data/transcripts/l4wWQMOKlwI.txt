[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.560]   I heard some coughing over here. I mentioned the word "crypto." What are we doing here,
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.360]   Matt? I mean, what would Jack say?
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:27.240]   I'm amazed you invited me. I am a Boglehead, so I feel like this is the prodigal son returning.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.600]   Let me read your bio so that people don't throw things.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.560]   So Matt is a Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise Asset Management, the world's largest provider
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.860]   of cyber currency index funds. They use the word "index." More than $5 billion in assets
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.520]   under management. Prior to that, Matt was the CEO of Insight ETFs and the former CEO
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.680]   of ETF.com and the Managing Director of Global Financial Informat.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.520]   Now Matt is a Boglehead. I've known Matt for a long time. Before he had gray hair. Before
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.640]   I had gray hair. He's been to conferences before. He was a big advocate of the, I think
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.680]   you created, I forgot what it was called, the low-cost ETF portfolio. What was that?
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.680]   The world's lowest-cost ETF portfolio, yeah.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.360]   Every year I used to go to a conference and Matt would put up there, "This is the lowest-cost
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.880]   total stock market fund, the lowest-cost international fund," and so forth. And it was kept on going
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.240]   down and down and down and down every year. So Matt is a diehard Boglehead. But he made
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.720]   this pivot to the dark side.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.560]   So first of all, why don't you explain why you've made the pivot?
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.480]   Oh, good question. I'm a diehard Boglehead. I wrote the foreword to Eric Balchunis' incredible
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.760]   book on Jack. I operated in the ETF space for 15 years. I think ETFs were an incredible
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.200]   invention. I think they did a lot to lower costs and improve tax outcomes for investors.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.560]   And it was really fun to see them go from something that people didn't trust, something
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.880]   that people didn't believe, but that I thought had value in the world, into mainstream apple
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.340]   pie of investing. And I think they've done a lot of good.
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:26.720]   And so after I sold ETF.com with my colleagues, I looked around for the next great technological
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.000]   breakthrough that I thought could bring efficiency and lower costs to the world, that I thought
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.680]   could help investors, but where the public didn't understand it and didn't like it.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.160]   And that was crypto. So that's where I made the jump.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.720]   I will remind everyone that there were congressional hearings about ETFs destroying the American
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.800]   dream. And even Vanguard didn't like ETFs. So I've seen technologies go from hated to
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.120]   well-understood and adopted. And although it may be unpopular in this room, I think
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.320]   crypto is on that journey as well.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.560]   Well, just as a reminder for people, Bogleheads.org, the forum, does not allow discussions on crypto.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.600]   There's a couple of reasons for that. You could read about it. But what happened as
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.440]   soon as people started discussing it, there was so much spam that started to hit the boards
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.280]   that the moderators were just overwhelmed with Bitcoin spammers.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.280]   And I'm sure you've seen them. That was one of the reasons why, in addition to other
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.840]   valuation reasons, why Alex decided-- and Alex is here. You can talk with him about
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.220]   it. There he is. You can talk to him directly. He's the man. He made the decision.
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.680]   So if you're a crypto fan and you want crypto on Bogleheads, grab his ear. Talk to him for
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:48.920]   three hours about it. Maybe he'll change his mind. Anyway, OK, so crypto. Bitcoin. This
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:58.560]   has grown. I mean, how much money now is in, say, just Bitcoin? How much is in Bitcoin?
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.480]   Bitcoin's about $1.3, $1.4 trillion today.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480]   That's a lot.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.040]   It's a real number.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.040]   And if we add everything else, like Ethereum and just the cyber currencies, how much are
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.040]   we talking about?
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.400]   It's about $2.4 trillion altogether. That's the asset class, if you want to call it.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   $2.4 trillion.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   Yep.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.680]   When I did the interview with you-- oh, it must have been only a few months ago-- it
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.000]   was just breaking two. So we've grown up 20% since then.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.120]   It's crypto. So first we went down, and then we went back up.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.120]   Yeah, that's the way it works.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.800]   There's a lot of volatility in this asset class, I guess you could call it. Right? OK.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.020]   But today, we're not talking about-- even though it says, does crypto merit a place
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.020]   in your portfolio? That's not what this is about. That's not what this discussion is
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:55.680]   about. I think I titled this discussion, but I titled it wrong. Anyway, it's about what
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.600]   is this thing called cryptocurrencies? And it's a very confusing term. I mean, it sounds
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:10.880]   like Superman, right? Was that Kryptonite? I mean, it sounds like Hollywood. And it puts
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:21.200]   people off, I think, just the name itself. But in fact, the name goes way back. And it
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.120]   really is the basis for what's called the blockchain.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:35.600]   So start from the beginning. Talk with me like I'm a third grader, OK? And tell me,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   what is the history of the blockchain, which is what this Bitcoin and all the cyber currencies
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.760]   sit on? And a little bit about how it works.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.640]   Great. Yeah, I think it's both really easy to understand and understood by very few people
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:02.380]   because it's wrapped in so much spam and nonsense. What crypto or blockchain is about is about
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:11.600]   a technological advance in actually in computer database design. And it's not an idea that
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   popped out of nowhere. It was something that people worked on for 50 years at the NSA,
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:23.520]   at Stanford, at MIT, that links back to cryptography and its use in the military. This was like
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.720]   a series of technological breakthroughs trying to make a jump in how computer databases work.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.460]   And that jump is called the blockchain. And here's the way to conceive of it. It's actually
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:39.440]   very simple. The way computers have always worked from when they're first designed to
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.680]   today, the vast majority of them work as individual nodes. So we talk a lot about crypto and finance.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.200]   So I'll use a finance example to make this clear. JP Morgan has a database of their customers
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.000]   and how much they own. Bank of America has a database of their customers and how much
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.040]   they own. Wells Fargo has a database of their customers and how much they own. And any computer
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.480]   architecture that you look at looks like that. It's a series of individual databases. All
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:13.520]   a blockchain is, all this 50 years of work, is how do you build one database that's available
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.860]   everywhere in the world, that everyone can see into, everyone can contribute to, that
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:26.280]   updates in real time and is always true, but that's not controlled by any single entity.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.480]   So if you think of JP Morgan's database, JP Morgan controls that. Wells Fargo database,
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.640]   Wells Fargo controls that. What a blockchain is, is a solution to a computer science program.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.100]   How do you have one database that's available everywhere in the world, everyone can see
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:47.880]   into, updates in real time, but that no single party controls, that's controlled by the crowd.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.760]   And the reason that's interesting, and we can get into this, is you can do things with
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:58.760]   this decentralized database, that's the buzzword people rap into it, that you can't do with
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.220]   a centralized database. And I'll make just one example. I think it's the least interesting
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.680]   thing crypto does. So I don't want to get hung up on this. I don't think this is what
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.160]   crypto is about, but it makes the point. You know that the Bitcoin blockchain is pretty
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:19.100]   incredible in that it can move money faster than JP Morgan, which is just a fact. Like
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:24.680]   if we wanted to send money today, somewhere around the world, JP Morgan could get it done
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.800]   on Monday. The Bitcoin blockchain could move a billion dollars in 10 minutes. How does
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.120]   it do that? Well, if you think about it, the core problem with moving money between JP
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.640]   Morgan and Bank of America is that there are two databases. So if I send you money, I'll
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.320]   write you a check from my JP Morgan account, and you deposit it at Bank of America, Bank
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.640]   of America has to check with JP Morgan to make sure I have the money, because they can't
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:52.360]   see into that database. If we all have one database that we're all operating from, and
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.040]   I say I want to move money from my account to Rick's account, it's trivially easy to
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:03.160]   update it. It's like updating an Excel spreadsheet. It can happen in seconds. So all crypto, and
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.960]   we can talk about the use cases, but when you hear crypto, when you hear blockchain,
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.820]   think about a computer science problem, which is how do you have one database that's available
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.580]   everywhere in the world, everyone can see into, updates in real time, is always true,
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:24.020]   but there's no single person or entity controlling it. It's decentralized. That's what it's actually
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:31.200]   all about, and I think it's the most important financial technology breakthrough of the last
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.160]   40 years.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:40.140]   So where does the idea of crypto or cryptology come into all of this? So yes, you can give
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:47.800]   money to me, I can give money to you through this decentralized control database, but why
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.460]   can't people just go in and just make false transactions and take everybody's money?
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:57.240]   Yeah, that's exactly right. So where the crypto comes from, and I think crypto is a terrible
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:03.000]   name, like crypto sounds dangerous and sounds bad and sounds scary and sounds like criminals,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.080]   but where it comes from is cryptography, and cryptography really emerged out of the military
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:17.680]   during the world wars in a way to send encrypted messages, and basically the way it works is
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.480]   something called public private key cryptography, but the easy way to think about this is I
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:29.440]   have a house, you could look up my address, but you can't come into my house because you
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.400]   don't have the key to my front door. Cryptography is the same way to do that electronically,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.560]   sort of how can I have an address?
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.680]   But you can actually look in my windows, you can see everything I have, correct? You know
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.880]   everything I've got in my house, you can see everything, you just can't take it.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.960]   That's exactly right, and so how do you apply that into a digital setting? How can I have
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:55.400]   a digital address that everyone can see into, but they can't access it? And the answer is
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.640]   something called RSA or public private key cryptography, which for what it's worth is
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:07.360]   not a new idea. All military communications uses the same cryptography as Bitcoin. All
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.000]   point of sale transactions, when you bought a coffee downstairs, how Visa communicates
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.400]   is the same cryptography as crypto. The way the internet works is the same thing. This
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:24.040]   is a fundamental technology, but people just stacked a few other innovations on top of
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:29.000]   it to create the blockchain, and that's where we are today.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.680]   So when we talk about blockchain, just to confirm, there's not just one big blockchain
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:41.720]   out there that controls everything, right? I mean, there's individual blockchain, there's
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:46.840]   private blockchains, there's public blockchains.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:52.000]   That's exactly right. So you can architect a blockchain in a bunch of different ways.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.280]   So you mentioned private versus public blockchain. Vanguard uses a private blockchain to settle
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:02.200]   transactions internally. The right way to think of a private blockchain is it's like
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:07.280]   corporate intranets. If you remember the early days of the internet, I do, the internet was
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.960]   terrible and it was scary and you weren't supposed to go on it and no one trusted it
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.160]   and Wikipedia would never be anything. In the early days of the internet, everyone thought
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:21.760]   corporate intranets were the future. Why? Because they were safe, secure, and controlled.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.800]   Your company could have an intranet and you could trust the information on it, but you
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:31.080]   wouldn't go into the wilds of the public internet. There be dragons.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.800]   The same thing is true in crypto. You can have a private blockchain that only five people
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:41.600]   can work on, and J.P. Morgan uses a private blockchain to move money from Department A
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.560]   to Department B within the bank, because it's the most efficient way to do it. As I mentioned,
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.880]   Vanguard uses a private blockchain for certain securities transactions. And a lot of people
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:57.800]   have been excited about private blockchains. My sort of base case is that just like with
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.680]   the internet, it's actually the public open blockchains that are the valuable one. And
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   we can get into this. There are many different blockchains, even publicly. There's Bitcoin,
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.960]   there's Ethereum. They do different things. They're good at different things. And they
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.040]   have different use cases in the world.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:23.680]   So you take something like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just one blockchain that everyone can access.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.200]   It's a public blockchain, correct?
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:33.000]   And if you have another type of cyber currency like Ethereum, that's a separate blockchain.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.440]   But it's just all ledgers. It's just all spreadsheets in a way.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.140]   So we can all have access to all of this. We can all see it. But to actually make a
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:45.720]   transaction and get it to work, something has to happen where if you're going to give
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.880]   me money or somebody in this room, we're going to transact and we're going to give each other
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:58.360]   money on this blockchain. It has to be verified in some way. So talk about the verification
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.360]   of all these transactions.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.800]   Yeah. Let's sit with Bitcoin. We can do Ethereum later because it's actually a more complex
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.200]   story. It's actually going to appeal to more of you because Ethereum has cash flow and
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:14.040]   Bitcoin doesn't. But you're right. If you think about what a bank does, a bank secures
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.520]   your money and processes transactions. And for that, they charge you a fee and you pay
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:23.000]   them in cash or they take your interest income depending on the bank.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.200]   In a blockchain, Bitcoin blockchain, same thing. It processes transactions and it secures
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:35.160]   the blockchain. But there's no one person doing it. So how does it work? The way it
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:42.800]   works is what you've heard called mining in the Bitcoin space. And what mining is, is
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.520]   all these computers around the world. Anyone can run one of these computers. You could
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:53.240]   run one of these computers, Rick. And these computers work to verify transactions and
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:58.840]   then settle them on the blockchain and secure the blockchain. So to use your specific example,
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:05.080]   if I put in a ticket, if you want an order to send you a Bitcoin or half a Bitcoin or
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:11.840]   a third of a Bitcoin, it goes into a pool. And then these computers around the world,
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.480]   they take all the people who want to send Bitcoin from person A to person B. They check
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.520]   to make sure that I have the Bitcoin that I'm trying to send to you. That's a valid
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.880]   transaction. They package a bunch of them together into what's called a block. That's
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:32.240]   where the word blockchain comes from. And then one of them gets to settle that block.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.400]   And then that enters and is sort of formalized in the ecosystem. And the way mining works
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.240]   is everyone's racing. One person gets to settle a block. Those transactions are finalized
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.680]   and then they do it all again. And every 10 minutes, a new block is processed. But it's
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.360]   the same thing banks are doing. It's just in a different way.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.800]   So you've got all these transactions all over the world that are happening with Bitcoin.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:59.520]   They're kind of adding all up in this block. And then at a certain time or a certain capacity
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:07.480]   of this block, then the miners go in and they try to solve some key. They try to figure
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:15.960]   out what the key is to verify all of these things. And if they're actually the winner,
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.480]   and by the way, this takes a tremendous amount of power, a tremendous amount of computing
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.720]   power. These are not simple transit, simple keys, if you will, that they have to figure
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:33.280]   out. Anyway, they then verify that yes, all of this is correct. And when a miner verifies
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:40.120]   that it's all correct and they find the key, they're the ones who get to the key first
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.280]   because there's all these competing miners out there trying to get to that same key.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.040]   They get the key. What happens after that?
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.320]   Yeah. So when they solve this math problem, and then I want to explain why there's this
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.440]   math problem, because I think people think it's just a waste. When they solve this math
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:01.880]   problem, they raise their hand and say, "I've solved the math problem. Here are the 10,000
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.240]   transactions that should be settled." Everyone checks their work and it's finalized. And
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:13.920]   then that miner receives a reward from the Bitcoin network of new Bitcoin. So right now,
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.520]   these blocks are settled every 10 minutes. And the reward you get is a couple of Bitcoin.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.360]   So a few hundred thousand dollars. And that's why everyone races to do it.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.200]   What is it? 3.125?
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:31.160]   That's right. Yeah. So about 200 grand. And then you might be wondering, so why this complex
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:38.520]   math problem? And the reason is, you need to make it costly to propose a solution to
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:44.640]   the network and say, "I've settled these transactions." Because otherwise, everyone would spam it
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.020]   with fake transactions, right? They would just spam it because it would be free. If
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:52.560]   you make it costly, then the only people who are going to raise their hand and say, "I
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:58.120]   did this," are people who have processed valid transactions. And then the network adopts
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.800]   it, and then they run the race again. The incredible thing about this system...
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:08.160]   One thing about it. Once the network adopts it, everybody out there gets an update, correct?
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.200]   That's right. And the incredible thing about the system... Remember what I tried to explain
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.000]   earlier, which is it's the first decentralized database that updates in real time and is
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.360]   always true. The reason it updates in real time is in order to run the next race, you
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.520]   have to have the information that was just settled in this block.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.920]   So if you think about how do you solve this problem of getting a million computers around
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.680]   the world to update in real time, the way it's solved is they all want to run this next
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:43.240]   race. And they can't run this next race until they update their database. And this is what
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:49.200]   allows it to work over time. And here's an incredible fact that's just true. Bitcoin
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:55.440]   blockchain has been working for 15 years, has 99.99% uptime. It has better uptime than
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:01.000]   the Swift network, the Visa network, or any major bank. And it's never processed a fraudulent
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.080]   transaction. It's an amazing result. And it's this mining algorithm that keeps people
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.640]   doing that.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:15.200]   So a couple of questions there. There's money involved for the miners. The first thing,
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.720]   if they solve this equation and they beat everybody to solving the equation, they get
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:25.280]   3.125 Bitcoin for doing it. Where does that Bitcoin come from?
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.640]   Yeah, it's issued. So we started with zero Bitcoin.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.920]   It's created out of thin air.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.200]   Well, Rick.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.760]   Kind of like the Federal Reserve in a way, right?
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:44.040]   Yes. Yeah. With limits. I mean, it's created from the energy consumed. But yes, yes. We
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.160]   started at zero Bitcoin. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin. The way we get to 21
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:53.880]   million Bitcoin is through this process of mining. It follows an asymptotic curve. So
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.960]   the amount of Bitcoin you receive falls in half every four years. If you heard the halving,
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.600]   that's why they call it the halving. Crypto loves to make up fancy terms. And eventually
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.960]   there'll be no more Bitcoin in 2140.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.080]   Well, there'll be a limited amount of Bitcoin, but it would all be issued.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.120]   It'll all be issued.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.280]   But I just want to confirm. I mean, there's not like this bank of Bitcoin sitting over
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:21.280]   here that's underlined by gold or anything, correct? That they just issuing 3.12. I mean,
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.480]   it is literally created and... No?
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:32.520]   Yes. Yes. So it's created like most things.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.520]   By who?
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:39.080]   By the people. It's the people's money. Now, let me go straight into this.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.960]   Sounds like our government.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:47.720]   No, hold on. Everyone, this is sort of the fundamental question that I know you are asking,
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.960]   which is, why does Bitcoin have any value?
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.880]   Well, we're not there yet, but I just want to say.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.880]   We'll get there in a minute.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.680]   You've got me pinned in this theoretical place. I want to make sure I get there.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:04.400]   I'm going to let you up for a minute here. So the miners get 3.125. So that's their incentive.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.400]   Yes.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.520]   At least for the next hundred years until all the Bitcoin are issued, correct? And it
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.840]   keeps halving. So it gets less and less and less.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.840]   Correct.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.120]   It's more and more expensive for them to do this. But also, if I was going to send you
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.680]   my money through the blockchain, the Bitcoin blockchain, I have to pay a little bit of
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.920]   a fee too, correct?
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.800]   You can pay a fee. So there's a tip or incentive fee. The way to think of it is these blocks
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.080]   can only process so many transactions. If there's more than that, if you want to jump
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.240]   to the head of the queue, you append a tip. I'll give you like a dollar, I'll give you
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.240]   two dollars.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.440]   Is that a tax-free tip?
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:46.300]   It's taxable revenue, Rick. Everyone in crypto follows taxes. The elegance of this is you're
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:51.540]   probably wondering what happens in 120 years when all the Bitcoin's gone. Well, the idea
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:56.480]   is that this tip revenue takes a bigger and bigger portion of the stack. And that's in
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:01.800]   fact true. When it started, it was 100% this issuance, which by the way, is called a Coinbase
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.320]   award if you want to know where Coinbase got its name from. This issuance of new Bitcoin
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:13.320]   is called a Coinbase award. The amount of tip revenue is zero. Now it's about 3 to 10%,
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:18.600]   depending on the day. And the idea is that in 2140, it'll be 100%. So it's a self-sustaining
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.240]   ecosystem of fundamental value.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:33.200]   Let's go way back to the first Bitcoin transaction, which I believe was 2010?
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.720]   The first commercial transaction, yes, of buying something, yep.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:42.800]   Where it took 14,000 Bitcoin to buy two pizzas, correct?
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.920]   Yep, something like that, yeah.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.760]   We've had some inflation in Bitcoin, have we not?
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:54.200]   It's the best way to hedge yourself against inflation. They look like pretty good pizzas.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:23:01.880]   I'm not going to lie. No, look, yeah. Originally, Bitcoin wasn't worth very much, which has
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.800]   to be true. If you're inventing a new store of value, it has to start at zero and eventually
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:13.240]   become very valuable. It has to start with high volatility and eventually become low
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.760]   volatility. That's actually exactly what's happened in Bitcoin. It's gone from zero to
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:25.200]   1.2 trillion dollars. Vol has fallen by more than 60% over the last 14 years in Bitcoin.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:33.840]   So yeah, some guy bought a Bitcoin, a pizza for what amounts today to like $400 million,
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:39.280]   which seems bad. It sounds like a lot, however good it was.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.640]   It's a good pizza.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:47.200]   But the reality is, it's unlikely he would have held that Bitcoin until today.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.080]   So it's interesting. So these two people decided they're going to do the first transaction
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:57.640]   and it's going to be a couple of pizzas and it's going to cost 14,000 Bitcoin. But then
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:05.160]   other people started just adopting this. And not only did they, by the way, this first
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.480]   took place in California, this transaction.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.960]   I think the transaction, yeah, it was U.S. based.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:15.160]   Okay, so it went through the U.S. and now it's all over the world. And now we have millions
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:21.560]   of people on this, which is kind of amazing if you think for this private currency that
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.560]   this is going on.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:28.400]   Now, so tell us why other, say other countries like Ghana or Libya, whatever, why would they
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.560]   like to adopt this? It's not because they think it's going to go up in value. They're
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.360]   using it actually for currency, correct?
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:41.040]   Well, I mean, they're using it to store wealth in economies where they have terrible currencies.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.760]   You don't have a great one. As Bill mentioned on the last panel, the government inflated
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.400]   away about 25% of the value of the dollar over the last handful of years. That's not
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:57.480]   great, but it's certainly the cleanest shirt around the world. If you're in another economy
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:04.800]   and you can't gain access to dollars, Bitcoin appeals to a lot of people.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:10.740]   My starting point is that it's not physically impossible for a new store of value to emerge
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:16.280]   in the world. It's not impossible for there to be a digital store of value, and it appears
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.720]   as if Bitcoin is filling that role. So yes, in these countries around the world, people
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.800]   are using it to store value. Some people are using it for payments, although I think the
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:28.200]   primary use is store value, and it's gaining adoption.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:36.960]   Okay. Oh, by the way, if you have questions, we'll collect them, and we'll get to your
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:45.960]   questions. We've got about a little over 15 minutes left in this discussion. Now, your
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:58.000]   company is not a miner. No, your company has created products. You were one of the first
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.320]   exchange-traded funds. In fact, the least expensive, if you want to look at fees, being
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:11.760]   in Boglehead, to hold Bitcoin. So it seems to me, in the world, there are two types of
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:19.200]   people who buy Bitcoin. There are people who want to buy it as an investment or a store
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:25.080]   of value, and there are people who are using it for transactions, correct?
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:30.360]   Yeah. And the people who are using it for transactions, say, in the United States, it's
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:38.520]   a little difficult, right? I mean, if I buy Bitcoin to buy a car or buy something else
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:47.520]   with it, this is treated by the IRS as an asset. So on my tax returns, even if I buy
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:54.040]   a pack of gum for $2, I have to actually list that on my tax return. Do I not talk about
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.760]   this? Yeah, it's terrible to buy stuff. I've never
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.960]   bought a coffee with Bitcoin, but I've never bought a coffee with gold either.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.680]   Well, it's true. You would have had to do that.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.200]   And it'd be a lot easier to send you a little piece of Bitcoin than it would be to like
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:17.200]   shave a bar of gold. So, you know, look, it is not used for... Again, I think the primary
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.560]   value of Bitcoin is to be a store of value, a way to store wealth outside of the fiat
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.000]   system in a digital format. I think more people will want to do that in the future than do
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.280]   that today. But in the US, it's not a great transactional tool, and I doubt it ever will
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.720]   be. I mean, we have the dollar. Dollar's great.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:41.960]   Okay. So if you're going to store your value in Bitcoin, when you're going to buy something,
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.520]   you convert it to dollars and you use dollars to do it. It's a lot easier to just to convert,
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.960]   say, a big block of Bitcoin than it is, you know, each little individual transaction.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.400]   Yes. Yeah. A hundred percent. Yes.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.240]   One question came in, and I think we need to circle back to this. It has to do with
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:05.280]   the security of Bitcoin. So we hear a lot about it's a great platform for laundering
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:10.980]   money, a great platform for organized crime.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.240]   Thanks for having me, Rick.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:18.200]   Well, just tell us why things have gotten better.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:24.140]   So things have gotten a lot better. The most important day in Bitcoin's history from my
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:33.440]   perspective was a day in 2019 when the travel rule began to be applied to all digital asset
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.240]   service providers around the world, including things like Coinbase, including things like
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:43.880]   finance, etc. And if you look at the leading reports of the volume of activity that's illicit
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:51.960]   on the Bitcoin channel, it fell from about 1.2% of transactions to about 0.3%. And today,
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:57.600]   even the Department of Justice says that Bitcoin does not have significant criminal use. And
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:04.000]   the reason for that is every Bitcoin transaction is traceable. It's synonymous, but it's traceable.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.720]   You can go back in time for every Bitcoin forever. And what happened is they began regulating
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:15.400]   entities like Coinbase, which are the exit points to the traditional system. And any
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:24.000]   time an illicit transaction hits one of those exit points, it's seized. And I know people
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.600]   are skeptical of this, but the government itself has come out and said it's not primarily
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.920]   used for criminal activity now. There's a huge amount of regulation. Now, there are
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.520]   parts of crypto where that's not true. These things called privacy coins, which I think
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.880]   will be made illegal. These things called mixers, which are being made illegal. But
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:51.300]   traditional just use of Bitcoin, there really just isn't criminal use anymore. There used
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:55.940]   to be, but there's not. Less than for cash.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:06.320]   So I'm a rogue country, North Korea. I buy a quantum computer. Now, this is way beyond
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:11.920]   the power of anything. It's just being created. Let's say this quantum computer, it can break
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:21.500]   the code of the Bitcoin blockchain and basically take everybody's money. Tell us the threat
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:26.920]   of quantum computing, which by the way, is an interesting area. I do follow this industry.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:32.400]   It's really come a long way. What safeguards are being put in place to protect things like
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.960]   this, in a way, legacy Bitcoin blockchain, which is quite old, as we talked about, against
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.520]   new technology such as quantum computing?
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.680]   Yeah. I mean, the place I would start is that if North Korea has a quantum computer that
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:49.600]   breaks RSA cryptography, Bitcoin is going to be the last thing they look at. I think
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:55.200]   they'll look at US military communications, because they would be able to see through
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.080]   all of that. I think they would look at the fundamental functioning of the internet and
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:05.920]   the energy grid, all of which relies on the exact same cryptography that Bitcoin has.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:13.840]   Bitcoin, it wouldn't make sense to steal people's money using quantum cryptography breaking,
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.120]   because the act of doing so would destroy the value of Bitcoin. I don't worry about
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.960]   it, because there's been huge advances in quantum resistant cryptography, because it
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.500]   is the centerpiece of how the internet and all military communications and all commercial
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:33.120]   transactions take place. I think quantum resistant cryptography will be solved before steady
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:38.960]   state quantum computing. And if we're wrong, I really think Bitcoin's the last thing to
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.080]   be worried about. I'd be worried about nuclear codes.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:53.960]   Let's go on to another topic. So we have an energy shortage here, and we're trying to
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:32:01.000]   make energy more green. We have climate change and so forth, and a big discussion about that.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:09.660]   And of course, there's two sides to it. But there's no doubt that mining Bitcoin takes
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:19.040]   a heck of a lot of energy. And as more and more and more energy is being used to do this
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:24.880]   mining of cryptocurrencies, I mean, isn't that sort of counterproductive to where society
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.880]   is trying to go?
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.880]   Yeah. I mean, I'd say two things. First, it uses about the same amount of money, energy,
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.960]   as video games. And I would argue that a new currency...
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.480]   A heck of a video game.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:40.720]   Well, I'm saying. It's just facts. But look, this is like anything. We have gas powered
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:46.800]   cars and we're moving to electric cars. Blockchain started with an energy intensive infrastructure,
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:52.320]   and it's moving to an energy light infrastructure. So Ethereum, the second largest blockchain,
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:58.720]   doesn't use mining. It started out using mining. It uses a new technology called proof of stake,
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:04.240]   which requires people to put up collateral to guarantee their honesty in processing transactions.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:09.000]   Bitcoin is still on the original version, which is called proof of work, which involves
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.800]   all these computers running things. That's because Bitcoin is, I know you'll laugh, because
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:20.960]   in this setting it seems ridiculous, a very conservative blockchain. Ethereum is more
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:27.440]   open to innovation. I think eventually we'll move to a more energy resilient system in
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:32.160]   Bitcoin. But it's actually the transition's happening a lot faster in crypto than it is
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:37.360]   in almost any other industry around the world. So I think we're going through the same energy
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.560]   transition there.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.120]   Okay. Well, you mentioned a few things about, and I said this too, and Bitcoin's been around
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.160]   for a while now, what, 14 years, 15 years, right? Been around for a while. And there's
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:55.840]   new technologies that have come along. Okay. Now, before we get to some of those new technologies,
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:05.400]   if out with the old, in with the new, what keeps the value of Bitcoin at $60,000 a coin
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:11.360]   if there's better, newer, faster, cleaner technologies that do more out there?
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.280]   Oh, this is a great question.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.400]   I'm glad you like it.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:22.920]   Finally. Let me do one minute to explain the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum. And
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:28.760]   then by that means, answer that question. So every crypto asset is two things. It's
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:35.360]   a blockchain and an asset, the Bitcoin blockchain and Bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain and Ethereum.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.120]   The blockchain is just a piece of software and you can optimize a piece of software to
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:44.120]   be good at different things, right? Microsoft Word is a piece of software and Salesforce
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.080]   is a piece of software, but they do different things. The same thing is true in crypto.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:52.880]   Bitcoin was the first blockchain. And it's very simple. All you can make Bitcoin do is
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:58.960]   send money, receive money, hold money. That's it. That's it. Ethereum was the second major
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.880]   blockchain. It looked at Bitcoin and said, it's amazing. You can move a billion dollars
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.840]   around the world instantaneously. What if we could program this like we program other
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:11.040]   features? So Ethereum is a Turing-complete programming language, which means you can
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:18.640]   program Ethereum to act like a bank or to do conditional things. Give Rick my Ethereum
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.360]   if he says something nice about me.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.360]   So it can do contracts.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.600]   They can do contracts. Now, it can do anything. You can build the New York Stock Exchange
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.800]   on Ethereum. And there are examples like that. You may wonder why is Bitcoin worth more than
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.540]   Ethereum if Ethereum can do everything Bitcoin can do and then some. And this is the answer
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:42.120]   to your question. In designing software, having limited capability has one big advantage,
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:45.240]   which is it makes your software extremely secure.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.040]   If you think about the Bitcoin blockchain as a piece of software, it's relatively simple.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.760]   It's been around for 15 years. It doesn't update much. There's very little chance of
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:57.400]   there being a bug in it. If you think about the Ethereum software, it's very complex.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:02.080]   It goes through major upgrades every two years. The chance of a bug is substantially higher.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:07.080]   And that gets to use case. Bitcoin is used as digital gold. If you want to build digital
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:12.480]   gold, the only thing you care about is it's secure. It doesn't need to sing. It doesn't
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:19.640]   need to dance. It just needs to be secure. Digital gold is a $17 trillion market. Bitcoin's
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:24.080]   penetrating that. And that's what it's rewarded for. If you want to build a new financial
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:29.320]   ecosystem, you need to sing and dance, etc. That's what Ethereum is doing. But it won't
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:33.600]   ever compete with Bitcoin because it will never be as secure as Bitcoin.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.400]   The other reason that Bitcoin can't be surpassed for its use case of digital gold is that the
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:43.560]   security of a blockchain depends on how much money people spend mining it or doing proof
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:50.120]   of stake. And Bitcoin just has a lead. And it's hard to assail. You and I could create
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:56.640]   Matt Rick coin, but it would be secured only by the power of my phone. Anyone could hack
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:02.960]   it. It'll be hard for another asset to disrupt Bitcoin as digital gold. But other use cases
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.040]   of blockchain, you'll see a lot more competition.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:13.960]   Well, we've got a couple of minutes left. Let's just get into valuing Bitcoin. I mean,
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.920]   value Bitcoin. Is that an oxymoron?
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:29.400]   Not at all. Bitcoin provides a service. Unlike stocks and bonds that pay cash flow or real
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:34.280]   estate that pays cash flow, where you could say, OK, here's a series of cash flows that
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.920]   you're going to get so we can discount those cash flows by some discount rate based on
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.640]   risk and we can come up with what the net present value of that stream of cash flows
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:49.520]   is out to perpetuity. Well, Bitcoin, like gold, granted, doesn't have any cash flow.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:56.240]   And so you can't, by some standards, you cannot put a value on it because there's no cash
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:02.320]   flow. But it does have a value. I mean, it trades at a price. It trades at a price every
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:07.760]   day. And I asked you this question on the podcast, but I'll ask it again. I mean, it
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:17.420]   seems to me, and maybe I'm wrong, that if it cost me as a miner, it cost me $60,000
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:24.360]   or $30,000 per Bitcoin to mine, that at least should be somehow factored into the price.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.960]   So, I mean, that might be one determinant. In other words, how much does it cost a miner
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:38.720]   to mine Bitcoin has some factor in determining what the price is? Does it?
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:43.040]   I think it has some factor in determining the price, but the amount of cost to mine
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:49.560]   a Bitcoin has a reflexive loop with the price of Bitcoin because the more the value goes
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:54.960]   up, the more people mine, the harder it is to mine, the cost to mine goes up. I think
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:02.440]   of it a little bit differently and pretty simply. You know that sort of thing you do
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.820]   with kids where you draw nine dots and you ask them to connect it with four lines and
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:10.080]   they can't do it if they stay within the parameters. I feel like people are like that with this
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.380]   cash flow thing. Bitcoin provides a service, which is the ability to store wealth without
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:20.320]   relying on a government or a bank. You may not like that service. I like that service.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.680]   Millions of peoples around the world like that service. If more people want that service,
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.360]   the value of Bitcoin goes up. If fewer people want it, the value goes down. If no one wants
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:33.720]   it, the value goes to zero. That's actually not different from any other service. Salesforce
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:38.700]   provides a service. If more people want Salesforce's service, the value of Salesforce stock goes
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.240]   up. If fewer people want it, the value goes down. If no one wants it, the value goes to
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:47.880]   zero. The only difference is Salesforce is a centralized entity, so to get that service,
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:56.460]   you can pay Salesforce a subscription. There's no Salesforce. There's no centralized entity.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:03.480]   You can't pay a cash flow to get this service. The only way you can get the service Bitcoin
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:09.840]   provides is to buy Bitcoin. The more people do that, the more value goes up. It's actually
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:14.920]   just the same. More people, more value. Fewer people, less value. More people, more value.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.920]   Fewer people, less value.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.280]   >> So it's supply and demand.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:24.200]   >> It's supply and demand. I think it's going after a market that's probably $30 to $40
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:30.240]   trillion in size. So how much could a Bitcoin be worth? If Bitcoin captured the gold market,
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:35.320]   if it had the same amount of wealth in Bitcoin as is in gold, every Bitcoin would be worth
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:43.600]   $1 million. Right now, the market is saying it has about a 6% chance of doing that before
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.760]   you take discounts into effect. Maybe a 10% chance on a discounted basis. If you think
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:54.840]   it has a 20% chance or a 50% chance, then no matter what your discount factor is, the
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:41:00.080]   net present value is actually higher. So that's how I approach valuing Bitcoin. I estimate
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:04.880]   its chance of penetrating a market, and then I apply a discount factor to that. It's not
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.920]   that far off of cash flow.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:17.040]   >> But there is this black swan risk out there, right, where the first quantum computer that
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:22.840]   nobody knew about breaks the code, and now nobody wants Bitcoin anymore.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:26.920]   >> Yeah, or every government around the world bans it. That's why you don't put 100% of
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:38.480]   your portfolio in Bitcoin. I mean, at Bitwise, we talk about 1% to 5% of your portfolio,
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:43.760]   with 5% being the absolute max. Because above that, it makes your overall portfolio more
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:49.920]   volatile and subject to mass drawdowns. If you put 1% of your value in portfolio in Bitcoin,
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.680]   the most you can lose is 1%. And that's how I handle that sort of existential risk.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:59.800]   >> So let's look forward. We talked about Bitcoin, we talked about Ethereum, there's
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:06.280]   others. What is the one really interesting new thing that's coming along that you're
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   excited about?
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.640]   >> Yeah, I mean, first I should say from an investment perspective, we run a crypto index
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:16.160]   fund because my family had a Betamax growing up. You never know what the future of technology
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:22.000]   will look like. What are the applications that I'm excited about? I'm excited about
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:30.200]   digital gold. I'm excited about stablecoins disrupting payments. Stablecoins are digital
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   dollars on the blockchain. I think it's a crime that we pay a 2.5% fee every time.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.200]   >> 2.9%.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.600]   >> Every time we use a Visa card.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:46.280]   >> And then if a client pays me on a Friday afternoon after 4 o'clock, I don't get the
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.880]   money until Monday. And I still have to pay 2.9%.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:54.760]   >> Yeah, remember when we paid a dollar a minute for long distance phone calls? To me,
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:59.080]   the Visa fee feels like that. It's something that we've grown to accept as reality, but
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:06.520]   it doesn't have to be. Today, there's about $160 billion of dollars on blockchain called
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:13.480]   stablecoins issued by firms like PayPal. And those can move around the world instantaneously,
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:23.040]   settle instantaneously 24/7, 365. And the cost to transfer them is like sub-penny.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.240]   And that's all built on blockchain. That's all built on the Ethereum blockchain. I think
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:31.520]   we're going to wake up and stablecoins are going to disrupt Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:38.000]   the way cell phones disrupted AT&T. And that could happen almost in a day. I think we'll
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.360]   get stablecoin legislation next year and it'll be a game changer.
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:50.000]   We've got 15 seconds left, so I'm going to leave you with the floor and final comments.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.760]   >> I would just say thank you all for having me today. I know that crypto is outside the
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:02.880]   norm and really appreciate the open minds. Even though I've gone to the crypto dark side,
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:08.600]   as Rick said, Vogelheads remain my home. So thank you all for having me. I really appreciate
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.600]   it.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.640]   [ Applause ]
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:14.640]   >> Thank you.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.640]   >> Thank you.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:15.640]   >> Thank you.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:25.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
