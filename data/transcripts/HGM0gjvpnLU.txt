[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.760]   All right, I think we have time for one more question.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.880]   This one is from Nicholas, who prefaces the question
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.760]   by saying, not sure if you want to answer this.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.360]   Nicholas, I will try to answer this.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.960]   You ask, which habits are needed to be
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.720]   an MVP in the academic world?
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.360]   That's a good question, Nicholas.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.760]   Adderall and lying?
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.360]   Is that what I wasn't supposed to say?
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.200]   No, it's OK.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.200]   The formula is not super complicated.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.240]   If you want to be a star academic,
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.960]   there's three things that are preconditions.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.040]   They're not sufficient.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.040]   This won't necessarily get you there, but they're necessary.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.500]   So at the very least, you'll have to do these three things.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.020]   And typically, it's A, read.
[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.880]   And by read, I mean you do the work
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.200]   to keep up with the latest literature
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.560]   in your particular specialty.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.520]   If you're a theoretician, you are
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.240]   reading what people are doing in the topics you study
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.640]   and mastering their techniques.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.000]   If you're a lab scientist, you're
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.600]   looking at the innovations in lab scientist techniques,
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.960]   and you're learning from it.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.440]   This is really hard work.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.200]   Reading academic papers is hard.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.400]   Trying to figure out what academics is doing is hard.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.440]   The top people spend a lot of time on this.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.800]   Two, you're working relentlessly.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.200]   You're always working on research, carefully chosen
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.640]   projects.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.160]   You're always working on it at a faster pace than other people.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.440]   And when you finish one thing, you move on to the next.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.760]   The total number of hours top academics
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.760]   put into their research is typically much bigger
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.080]   than their peers, where it's more seasonal.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.280]   They're working on something.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.080]   They kind of do other things for a while, and they work on it.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.880]   Star academics are relentless about it.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.840]   It's priority one.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840]   They try to fit in the other stuff, the teaching,
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.280]   the whatever, when they can.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.640]   But the time is going to be on the research.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.000]   And then three, you attach yourselves to stars.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.360]   If you want to produce MVP caliber work,
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.040]   you have to be training under MVP caliber people.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.360]   It's very consistent.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.200]   It's very difficult to break up to a higher level
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.760]   than you studied under.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.120]   It typically goes the other way.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.240]   There's a reason why star academics are stars.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.960]   You have to learn from them how they do it, how they work,
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.680]   what they focus on, their techniques, their work ethic.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.640]   So you have to work with the very best people.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.560]   Now, you could do those three things and not end up a star.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.360]   There's raw brainpower and luck play a big role in this.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.800]   I mean, especially in mathematical fields
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.120]   or other types of fields, there's just horsepower
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.960]   that matters.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.520]   And I don't know how you develop it
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.000]   and how much of it you're born with
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.040]   and how much of it is the training you've
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.880]   done throughout your whole life or whatever,
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.280]   but there's a certain just type of ability
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.040]   to do spatial reasoning or internal numerical
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.120]   manipulations.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.560]   And that's just you probably have to have,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.480]   and some people don't.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.000]   And then there's this luck.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.040]   The topic you're working on works.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.080]   You can't always predict that.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.440]   But you're working on, let's say it's 2018.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.080]   You're starting a postdoc.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.840]   You're going to do a postdoc at wherever.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.000]   And what I'm going to focus on is
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.280]   the phenotypic expressions of coronavirus genotype point
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.160]   mutations.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.560]   And then the coronavirus pandemic comes.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.440]   Wow, you're going to get a lot of grant money.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.940]   You're going to get a lot of demand.
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.360]   What you're doing is really, really useful.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.640]   This would be a really good time.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.760]   Whereas at the same time, if in 2019,
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.000]   you were an epi professor at Johns Hopkins that had just
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.040]   published your first book, which was A World Without Viruses,
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.160]   why we will never again face a big pandemic because
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.960]   of the miracles of modern technology
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.820]   and the ability for populations to react nimbly and quickly.
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.700]   Now you're in a bad place.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.180]   You're not going to do as well.
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.680]   So there is luck involved as well.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.900]   But those are the necessary.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.060]   Like at the very least, you have to be
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.860]   mastering the literature, working relentlessly,
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.860]   and working with stars.
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.900]   And it's a focused, intense, deep work effort every day,
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.820]   reasonable amount.
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.740]   You could probably do four hours of this a day
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.060]   and just repeat, repeat, repeat.
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
