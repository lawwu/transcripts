[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Hey, this is Gary Kim at SHEPCON 2024. I'm here with Brett. Brett, can you introduce
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.040]   yourself?
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.720]   Yeah, Brett Clark, Elder at Crown Valley Community Church.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.080]   All right. And Brett, you've been reading from the LSB for a little bit. What do you
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.080]   think?
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.760]   I love the LSB. It's such a wonderful translation. I think one of the things that I'm really
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.320]   excited about is I'm not an expert in Greek. I really struggle with the original languages.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.440]   And the consistency of word translation has been an immense help for me in my role in
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.940]   preparing to teach the word at Crown Valley. One example is in Romans 1, where it talks
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.500]   about the seed of David. And that, in my mind, connects me all the way back to Genesis, where
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.040]   it talks about the seed. And so just simple word choices like that and consistency is
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.120]   so helpful of low-hanging fruit for someone like me in preparing messages. So I really
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.880]   love it. It's been a tremendous blessing to both me and my family.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.200]   All right, Brett, thanks for stopping by. Appreciate it.
