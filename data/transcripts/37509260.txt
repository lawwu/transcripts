[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340]   Welcome, friends, to this episode of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.000]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey, and I'm excited to spend some time today with you as we encourage
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.820]   one another, learn together, and ponder the delights and challenges that make homeschooling
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.460]   the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.980]   Now, whether you are just considering this homeschooling possibility or deep into the
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.160]   daily delight of family learning, I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.540]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome, you'll find even closer support
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.840]   in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.740]   So go to classicalconversations.com and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.500]   Well, I'm so glad to welcome you guys to this episode of Everyday Educator.
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.800]   And I have a new friend, new friend to me today with me, Alicia Clark.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:15.440]   Alicia is going to share with us a timely truth that we think it's really important for us
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.100]   to consider.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.400]   When we're thinking about homeschooling, and you may be at the point of your summer that
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:29.200]   you have begun to think about how to make this fall different or better or more effective
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.860]   than last year was.
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.380]   We've got something we'd love for you to consider that doesn't have anything to do with academics.
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.860]   Alicia, welcome to Everyday Educator.
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.800]   And thank you so much for being on the podcast today.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.960]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.020]   I am excited for people to get to know you.
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.980]   I have enjoyed hearing a little bit of your story as we got to know each other earlier.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.400]   And I feel sort of like we're kindred spirits already.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.780]   But I want people to get a great introduction to you.
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.460]   So tell us about your family, a little bit maybe about where you live and how you got involved
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.060]   with CC.
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.540]   Sure.
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.100]   We live in Durham, North Carolina, where my husband is a missions pastor at our church.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.920]   And we have three precious kiddos, 15 and 13 year old boys and a newly minted nine year
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.540]   old daughter who thinks she is quite grown up and has new earrings to show.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.620]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.200]   That is a rite of passage.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.780]   It absolutely is.
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.420]   And yes, we've been here the whole time.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:49.020]   I did not set out to homeschool, but the Lord brought quite a few family and friends in my
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.720]   path who encouraged me to consider it and broke down some of my stereotypes and fears about it.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.740]   And yes, long story short, we have now been in CC for 11 years.
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.000]   Wow.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.260]   That is really good.
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.540]   OK.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.420]   There are people out there who are saying, oh, that's my story.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.360]   I never intended to do this.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.180]   In fact, I frankly can't believe that I'm doing this.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.000]   But you're right, Alicia, when you meet somebody that defies the stereotype that you had in your
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.920]   head, it does break down some of your worries, maybe some of your misgivings, and it makes
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.700]   it way more possible to consider homeschooling.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.060]   So, yeah.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.700]   Absolutely.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.740]   Absolutely.
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.780]   That's just that's cool.
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.240]   And I'm glad I would encourage you listeners to seek out friends who have different experiences
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.240]   than you so that maybe they will be barrier breakers for you also.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.840]   So it sounds like you've got a nine-year-old.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.400]   So you're still deeply into the Foundations Essentials years.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.980]   But you've also got early challenge students.
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.180]   You've homeschooled for a lot of years.
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.320]   So I can ask you this, and you're the great authority on this.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.820]   Which is the hardest age to homeschool?
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.980]   Oh, goodness.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:23.860]   In all honesty, I mean, I'm guessing you would agree that every single stage has its own very
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.620]   unique challenges, right?
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.960]   And much like babyhood and toddlerhood, just when you figure out how to deal with a particular
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.680]   challenge, something changes and you have a new challenge, right?
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.280]   So I think they're all challenging.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:47.600]   But my answer today, at least, is that I really think that the little years might be the hardest
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:57.460]   process simply because you are laying a groundwork during those young years for even being receptive
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.660]   to being taught.
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.160]   Oh, wow.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.100]   That is a really great insight.
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:11.260]   And so I feel like those little years are hard, but so crucial because you're beginning to teach
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.440]   the tools of learning that we learn about in CC, that you're also kind of teaching some
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.980]   prerequisites to those in a sense because you're teaching your kids that they are under
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.520]   an authority who loves them and who can be trusted and who can be followed.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:36.140]   And so I think praying for teachability in our kids and then working towards training them to be
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.600]   teachable, I think, are some of the hardest things in those young years.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.380]   You know what?
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.800]   That is a really great insight.
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:53.680]   A lot of what we do before we start homeschooling, you know, because a lot of people say we really
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.120]   didn't start homeschooling until our children were in first grade or second grade.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:06.360]   I, my older daughter used to tell people, oh, we never did school until Sarah got into first
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.700]   grade.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.920]   And she's like three years older than Sarah.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.300]   And so I would say, please do not go outside in public saying that you never did school
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.560]   until your sister.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.860]   I mean, cause you were like what, eight when we started to homeschool.
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.500]   But it didn't feel like school to her.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.400]   But we all know that the pre work, you're right.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.220]   A lot of it has to do with training the heart.
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.000]   Yes.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.180]   I'm beginning to form the character and beginning to build the kind of relationships that will
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.780]   allow you and your children to learn together.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.560]   Yes.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.340]   Absolutely.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.380]   It's such a big thing.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.040]   It is heart training before you can begin academic training.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.360]   That's very true.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.840]   I think that's really true.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.480]   Well, let me ask you this, cause I know the answer for me and I'm wondering if what your
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:08.540]   answer would be when you started homeschooling and you told me you started, you guys started
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:15.860]   in 2014, back in 2014, when you started homeschooling, did you and your family, did you and your husband
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.520]   have a family mission statement?
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.240]   So like, what was your priority as you began this homeschool journey?
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.440]   That is a great question.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.800]   No, we had, we did not have a family mission statement.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.540]   We had no clue what that was.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.080]   Right.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.980]   Who knew what that was?
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.500]   It was not on our radar at all.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:48.820]   Um, but, um, I think we were already forming, um, the values, you know, the things that we value
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.000]   that were important to y'all, the goals.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.580]   Exactly.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:08:01.300]   And so I think, you know, as my, as my oldest approached his fifth birthday, um, I was increasingly
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:08.680]   feeling like I did not want to relinquish him to this building with a bunch of strangers who
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.140]   may be wonderful, but I didn't know them.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.660]   I didn't know what they were going to teach him.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.480]   And I really wanted to have that front row seat to watching him learn and grow.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.840]   And so that combined with the encouragement we received from some friends and family, especially
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:28.460]   my sister-in-law who came home for Thanksgiving with her foundations guide from CC and said,
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.240]   Oh, how cool.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.320]   Look at what we're learning.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.340]   Look at how we use music.
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.480]   We use songs to learn all these different things.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.220]   And we do geography and history.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.400]   And it was so much that was very important to me that my kids learn.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.840]   And I knew that schools, many schools were struggling to teach those anywhere.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.200]   Right.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.380]   And so all those things kind of factored into our reasons for giving it a shot that first
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:51.740]   year.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:57.140]   Um, but I will also say that somewhere in that first year or two, probably that second year
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:02.600]   when we had to register with the state of North Carolina, we had to select a name for our
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.860]   homeschool and my husband and I prayerfully chose, I think it was my husband who actually
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:16.040]   thought of it, but we chose high view Academy because we have a high view of the Lord.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.660]   We have a high view of scripture.
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.900]   It's authoritative in all areas of our life.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.680]   And we have a high view of education.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.900]   Um, and we also know that from high views, you have a good view of everything else.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:37.480]   And so those were kind of some of our guiding values, I think, as we started.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.940]   That's really beautiful.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:48.480]   I think that for a lot of us who started homeschooling, um, when our children were little, we had ideas
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.740]   of what we wanted our children to learn.
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:10:03.740]   So I don't want anybody to stifle their interest or to say, oh, it's not time to learn about
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:04.160]   that.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.520]   Or we don't have time to chase that thought.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.060]   I wanted them.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.580]   My older daughter was very curious about everything.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.260]   And she was very, um, verbal about her desires.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:22.220]   And I thought this could be seen as a problem in a classroom.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.020]   Um, and I didn't want that to, to be a problem.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:35.500]   So we valued, um, being able to chase curiosity and, and, um, stoke the wonder that was handling
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.120]   in their little hearts.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.200]   Yes, agreed.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:47.620]   And so we didn't have a family mission statement either, but our priority was to keep them loving
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:56.320]   the act of learning as long as we could and to, to learn alongside them.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.160]   My husband and I both feel like we have teacher hearts.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.660]   Yes.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:06.560]   And so explaining things and finding out things together was really important for us.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:13.160]   Um, we also really wanted to know our children.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:21.520]   And to get to know their personalities and to, to be known by them.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.320]   My husband's also a pastor.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.740]   And so his office has always been in our home.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:32.660]   So the four of us have been home all together forever.
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:40.160]   And that was such a blessing that as our daughter got older, we couldn't imagine breaking the fellowship,
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.440]   you know?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.080]   Um, and so that was really important to us.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:53.120]   And it was important to us that our children, um, grow up knowing the Lord in all the things
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:02.480]   that they did, not just Sunday school or when we had family devotion, but working on the fruits
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.220]   of the spirit.
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.560]   Um, as we lived and it's harder, you know, y'all let's be real.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.680]   It's harder to live out the fruits of the spirit with your brothers and sisters than it is with
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.500]   people that you see once or twice a week at dance lessons or ball practice.
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:23.760]   You know, um, the people that you see make mistakes and the people who are crabby, they get up.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.940]   So that was important to us.
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.900]   That was important.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:37.440]   And I've heard you talk about the, the, um, the act of prioritizing, like what do you do
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:46.980]   with academics and relationships and finding the right balance with your children between
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.420]   academic excellence and relationship?
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.120]   Talk about that a little bit.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.180]   How did you learn to find that balance?
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.080]   That's, that's a really great question.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:06.880]   Um, you know, I don't know if that's something that I've just caught from relationships in my
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:13.460]   life or, you know, have just absorbed in church and in family in the past.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.780]   I can't pinpoint where it came from, but we were a family.
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.200]   I'll just say from the get go.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.500]   I mean, obviously we value education, um, tremendously.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:29.800]   And my husband and I both have advanced degrees and I come from a family with parents who have
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.320]   advanced degrees and, um, lots of teachers in the family too.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:40.400]   And we value education, but I think it's, it's always, honestly, this probably goes back to my
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:47.800]   mom's own example, to be honest, is that she, I think has more than anybody instilled in me
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.160]   that the relationships do take priority over the academics.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:14:00.160]   And so, yes, we may have great goals for our day, for our math lessons and reading lessons and
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.540]   whatever else we have to tackle.
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:09.180]   But the moment that an opportunity to shepherd hearts comes up, that takes priority.
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.060]   That's really good.
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.280]   That's really good.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:25.240]   Um, so I'm guessing that there are some days that are more academic and less heart training
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.520]   and some days that are more heart training and less academic.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.180]   Can you predict the ebb and flow?
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.420]   And is it the same for all of your kids?
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.200]   And no, no, no, no.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.000]   Um, I think that's one of the hardest things to me.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.480]   And sometimes one of the most exhausting things is that I feel like life can become triage sometimes,
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:46.980]   right?
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.760]   It's like, you may have plans, but they, they get disrupted.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.340]   The moment you set your foot on the floor.
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:15:02.720]   Um, so no, I mean, yeah, no, I feel like, I feel like each kid's needs are different.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.620]   Each life stage and age has its own needs and challenges.
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.800]   Yes, because you've got a younger and then you've got some teenagers and you've got girl and boy.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.880]   Is there differences in what they need relationally?
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.560]   I think so.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.240]   Absolutely.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:26.460]   Um, yes, I see a lot of differences between my boys and even how they were at the age that my
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.340]   daughter is now.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.500]   I see a lot of gender differences.
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:37.020]   Um, uh, it could also be firstborn girl against mama that creates some challenges too.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.340]   Um, and so, yes, I, I think every day, every day is different.
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:49.000]   And, and when I say heart issues, I would also say that that doesn't necessarily mean
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.920]   sin issues, although that's part of it, right?
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.320]   Absolutely.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:52.820]   Sure.
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:59.160]   Some of it is just, it's just dealing with, with struggles, with deficiencies in character,
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.680]   deficiencies in perspective, limited perspective.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:08.700]   There's just so many, um, uh, what's the right word I'm looking for?
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:14.040]   Um, social, emotional needs that come into play.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:20.400]   Um, and it takes wisdom, but, but if it, if it deals with the heart and with relationships,
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.340]   it takes priority over academics.
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.660]   So it doesn't matter what my goal is that we're trying to get done by lunch.
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.020]   Right.
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.200]   We're going to stop.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.740]   I was just telling my daughter that a few times this week.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.240]   I'm like, honey, I need you to know, I know that you want to get done with this lesson,
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:40.320]   but as often as I need to stop and tend to your heart and to your attitude, we're going
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:40.740]   to do that.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.420]   Cause that's more important than you learning how to do this math problem.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:50.540]   Well, that is so true, Alicia, because she's going to carry that attitude through her whole
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:51.120]   life.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.400]   And, you know, until she has to homeschool her own children, she might get to a point
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.140]   where she doesn't have to do a math lesson every day.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.820]   You're so right.
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:07.060]   And there are, um, there are absolutely instances where the academics that we're pursuing with
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.060]   our children during a day uncover a heart issue.
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:20.280]   You know, um, I've talked to so many people who say that, um, for whatever reason, math
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:28.300]   is the great uncoverer of heart issues, whether that be, um, a heart that's full of anxiety
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:36.920]   or anger or frustration or, or, or I already know how to do it.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.780]   Mama, I don't want to know how to do that.
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.120]   Right.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:45.200]   Or, or, well, I know how to do it better than everybody else in my class.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.960]   And then that becomes a big head issue, you know?
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.380]   Yeah.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:56.580]   Um, yes, I definitely think, and I think that it's, it's beautiful.
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:07.600]   It's also difficult that, um, homeschooling your kids means that you are always at home
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:13.300]   with those little people and you are all rubbing up against each other.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:21.620]   Um, and so, and you know where everybody, everybody knows where everybody else's sore spot is and
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.920]   our human nature is just to provoke.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:32.100]   And then things come out that need to be, um, that need to be dealt with.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.740]   And so living in community, right?
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.540]   Right.
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.280]   That's what I was going to say.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.740]   Living in community is grace.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.000]   For all that to come to the surface.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Yes.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.580]   But it is such a wonderful ground.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:47.140]   And it's not, I'm not saying wonderful as in, oh, this is all hearts and flowers and we
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.180]   love it every day.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:48.960]   It's not easy.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.600]   No.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:56.720]   Some, uh, some days I went to bed and thought, okay, we got nothing done that anybody would
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:06.780]   check off their box, but we did have a breakthrough in stubbornness or we did at least identify
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.000]   a problem with mercy.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.140]   You know, I had, I had kids that were really, um, proponents of justice.
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:24.480]   If it was meeting out justice for somebody else, they were big proponents of grace if it was
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.960]   coming back towards them.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:33.400]   And that's a huge heart issue, but that's something that, um, as parents who really love our children,
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.480]   that's where we need to spend a lot of time.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.580]   I really think, you know, I mean, we're, we're born sinners.
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.840]   We've inherited a sin nature from our parents.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.940]   And so our, our kids need a savior first and foremost.
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:54.700]   And then as we teach and train them even before they have put their trust in Christ and after
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:20:01.020]   when they have entered that sanctification process, it's one of our greatest callings,
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:06.980]   I think, and joys really is shepherding their perspective, their understanding of themselves,
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.960]   their understanding of life situations, their understandings of struggle.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:18.900]   Um, and so I think there's just a lot of, there's just a lot of shepherding involved.
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.380]   That's really, that's very true.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.260]   There's a lot of, that's a good way to see it too, that we are shepherding.
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:31.140]   I mean, the Lord is shepherding, shepherding us as parents for that.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:31.540]   Yeah.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:37.220]   Praise him for his, um, his faithfulness and his gentleness and his persistence at pursuing
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:37.580]   us.
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:45.720]   But we are shepherding our children and we are responsible to the Lord for growing them, um,
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:51.160]   toward him, you know, and we're not responsible for saving them.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:58.580]   That's what the Lord himself does, but he gives us our children to bring up in the nurture and
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:10.140]   admonition of the Lord to, to, to love them into proximity to the kingdom by showing them
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:15.520]   what it means to live in community and learn the fruits of the spirit.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.040]   And the home is such a great place to learn that.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:19.820]   Yes.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.400]   Yes.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.380]   I think you hit on something by mentioning we're loving them in this, this is the way we
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:31.300]   love them because, you know, as I was thinking about the prioritizing of heart issues over
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.300]   academics and relationships over academics, I thought about that verse.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:41.680]   I think it's first Corinthians eight one that says that knowledge puffs up, but love builds
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.020]   up.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:42.860]   Yes.
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.240]   And I love that verse.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:50.520]   We actually had an essentials tutor who often said it in our class a few years ago, and, um,
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.880]   it has stuck with me since then.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:22:01.000]   But, you know, if we give our kids an excellent education, but neglect loving them and teaching
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.500]   them to love God and others, then their education is empty.
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.380]   To what end does it serve?
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:15.940]   Um, but love builds up and love itself, the call to love that, that necessitates relationship.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.440]   It necessitates prioritizing relationship.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:26.120]   And so, um, you know, I think of first Corinthians 13, we can do all these things, but if we have
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:30.600]   not love, you know, we have nothing.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:39.160]   Um, and so that to me is a great reminder that relationships, our relationship with one
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:46.040]   another, our kids and our own relationship with God, all of that takes precedence.
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.360]   Um, you know, seek first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added to you.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.100]   That takes precedence over the academics.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.040]   Hey everyone.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.800]   I want to interrupt this show to tell you about this semester's sponsor, Judson College.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.980]   You know, here at Everyday Educator, it's really important to us that what we are giving our
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.980]   children aligns with the three pillars of CC.
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:12.780]   We're classical, we're Christian, and we focus on community.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.460]   Well, Judson College has those values as well.
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:19.820]   And I want to tell you specifically about how they align with our Christian value.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:26.240]   Judson College is the only four-year accredited confessional Christian university in North
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:26.800]   Carolina.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:33.440]   And that means that as a Christian institution, they are committed to remaining grounded in the
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.740]   authoritative, inerrant word of God.
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.000]   That's really important.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.780]   Judson has a wide variety of degrees for students to choose from.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:47.280]   And those degrees are taught by exceptional faculty who are experts in their fields and passionate
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.140]   about investing in the lives of their students.
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:58.060]   Composed of five unique communities, Judson's house system provides a vibrant and intentional
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.160]   take on student life.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.780]   In those different houses, the students have an opportunity to make lifelong friendships, participate
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:11.560]   in house competitions, and experience deep community all the way from freshman year to graduation.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:17.000]   To help students pursue God's call on their lives without the added weight of financial burdens,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Judson has provided a number of students.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.940]   Judson has provided a number of different scholarships to help with tuition costs.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:28.280]   If you want to find out more about Judson College and see if it's right for you, go to judsoncollege.com
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.540]   forward slash distinctives forward slash.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.020]   Let's get back to the show.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.060]   Absolutely.
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:43.380]   And I think you're right when we give priority to guiding the hearts of our children.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:53.840]   And when we shepherd their hearts and sometimes mete out discipline to those hearts, just like
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:25:01.660]   the Lord gives us discipline, then what we create is an atmosphere where, as a family, we can
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.960]   learn together more easily.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:14.160]   And that's that, you know, I know, I mean, there were days when, you know, there's stuff
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:20.380]   bubbling under the surface and we're starting our schoolwork and it is just not, nothing is
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:24.520]   flowing easily, not even the stuff that usually comes easily.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:32.960]   And there is tension and there are, you know, side eye glances and tones that are verging on
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.300]   disrespect and, and the learning is not smooth.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:36.520]   Time for a reset.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.800]   Exactly.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:47.240]   And if you don't stop and reset, then the rest of the day is just like walking through quicksand
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:54.620]   and you just never, you feel like you're, you, at the end, you, you're tired to the nth degree
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.460]   and you've not made any progress.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.780]   Two things stand out, come to mind when you say that.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:07.100]   One is that old parental advice of begin as you mean to go.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.080]   Yes, ma'am.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:14.080]   And secondly, um, an illustration I remember getting from a college professor about jerking
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:20.380]   a wagon wheel that back in the days of, you know, the, the trips out West, they had these
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.700]   wagons, but when they would, you know, a lot of wagons might go over the same path over and
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:29.400]   over again and it would develop ruts in the road and you get stuck in a rut and it's really
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.040]   hard to get out.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:35.240]   You can only get out of that rut by jerking the wheel and turning hard out of it.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.880]   And I feel like some days are like that when I can tell that our hearts are in a rut, we've
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.940]   got to do something dramatic to jerk that wheel.
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.180]   And I think that can look a lot of different ways.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:50.180]   That may just mean setting down whatever books we're looking at and having a discussion.
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.460]   Um, it also could mean put down your books.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.040]   We're turning on some music and having a dance party right now.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.080]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.940]   Or let's pick up our books and we're going to go outside on a picnic blanket and do school
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.160]   the rest of the morning outside.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.080]   Right.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.260]   Just something different.
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.120]   Right.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:16.100]   And, and that when you do the dance party or when you take it outside, um, it, it shows
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:20.940]   your children that a reset is not the same thing as a punishment.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.900]   Okay.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:27.200]   So your heart is not at peace or, or my heart is not at peace.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.080]   We are not jibing.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.540]   We are not in sync with each other.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:37.680]   Um, and so sometimes, and so in that I'm not punishing that I'm resetting that.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.780]   I like that, that, that you can reset by doing something funny.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.080]   And we did that.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.320]   There were times we just packed in the books and said, yep, we're done.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.260]   And the kids would be like, what do you mean?
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:55.560]   I'm like, we are not accomplishing anything that is productive.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:02.280]   We, we have lost the joy in this and it's more important that we keep the joy than that
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.780]   we keep the schedule.
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:08.180]   So we're going to go do something different to recapture the joy.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:18.520]   And sometimes I think for them, it was like, oh, oh, so this is just something that happened.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:24.680]   And it gave them, I think the example that when things are off the rail like that, you have
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.260]   to stop.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:32.360]   It's better to stop than to just keep plodding ahead and being unhappy and unproductive.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.040]   Right.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:38.700]   And it becomes a wonderful time too, to, to reset in terms of saying, I love you.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.480]   I treasure you.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.680]   Yes.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.980]   Let's celebrate that, you know?
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:44.640]   Yes.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:51.180]   And sometimes we know, I know that, um, sometimes you just had to find something that could nurture
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:57.560]   the heart, um, while you kept walking through or slogging through the hard stuff.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:06.240]   I, I know I had one of my daughters in challenge a just really got to the point in the geography
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.800]   that it was such a struggle.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:18.580]   Um, the, the funny names of these African or Asian countries and capitals were just such
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.220]   a stress to her heart.
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:26.000]   And she, she would come at that section of the day with such trepidation.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.680]   And so I thought, okay, well, some days we would just do something else.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.320]   But the truth was, it was important to forge ahead.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:41.420]   There were important skills for her to build, but I thought, what can we do to make this?
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:47.120]   And so we went to the candle store and I let her pick a big old candle of the scent that
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:47.720]   she liked.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.960]   And I dubbed it the candle of happiness.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:59.060]   And so when we got to the point where we were at a hard part of the day and we were slogging,
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.640]   I would say, oh, we forgot.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:05.420]   We would light the candle of happiness and it would just, it would make her smile.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:10.600]   And she, I think it just was an expression of mama sees me.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:15.680]   Um, mama loves me enough to hold my hand while I do this hard thing.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.220]   But mama also is trying to make it fun.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.040]   She's trying to make it better.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.620]   And so that was a good, that built into this day.
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.660]   I can say to her, and she's a young mama of her own now.
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:33.620]   She has a three-year-old and a one-year-old and I can call and she'll be down and I'll
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.500]   say, do you just need the candle of happiness?
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.840]   Oh, how sweet.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.140]   She will laugh.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:46.080]   Um, so yes, I think there are things that we can do just to nurture the loving spirit in
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:51.780]   our home, even while we are marching forward on our academic plan.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:31:02.400]   Um, cause we've talked a lot about, um, keeping relationships as the first priority, even for
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:09.000]   those of us who really have high academic standards, but keeping relationships as first priority.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.300]   How do you do that?
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:16.460]   You've got two young men who are moving into junior high and high school.
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:24.680]   How do you keep relationship as the first priority when challenge work gets more demanding or it
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:29.100]   takes more time, um, or this stuff is just harder.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:33.040]   It might actually take more effort to accomplish.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.760]   That's a wonderful question.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:41.040]   And I would, I would also say not only is the challenge work more difficult for them, but
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:46.860]   they are increasingly independent and don't need my help quite as much.
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.960]   And my younger one needs my help a whole lot.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:57.500]   And so as a result, as we kind of get in a groove and the machine starts running day in and day out,
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:04.860]   I have found that it takes a lot more intentionality to build and foster the relationship with my sons
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.900]   because they largely are independent.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.780]   Right.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:08.680]   Right.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.820]   Um, I do think, I think that takes some creativity.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.200]   I think it takes intentionality.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:18.160]   We try to build rhythms into our day of doing some things together.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.000]   Like we have, we have breakfast.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.140]   We typically have all of our meals together.
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:27.000]   Um, but we start the day with breakfast on our best days.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.700]   I, I don't know about you, but we have ideal days and then we have real life, but on, on
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:36.080]   our best days, we, we are reading through scripture together.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.600]   We're maybe watching world watch.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.840]   We like watching that little new show and talking about that and may do wordle or connections,
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:48.320]   some little brain trivia thing, um, before we dive into our day.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:55.420]   And then, you know, again, ideally I would check in with them at certain times during
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:33:03.720]   the day, but also I think we foster, um, we just foster good communication, um, and even
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.280]   build inside jokes.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:14.760]   Like I'll say this, um, I, years and years ago, um, a colleague of mine mentioned, and I
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:19.180]   know you'll appreciate this as a former challenge being director, um, but she mentioned that
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:27.680]   the middle school years are the cat years because, you know, how cats like to come around on their
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.460]   own times when you want them to come, they don't want to come.
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:35.540]   But if you don't really care if they're there or don't even want them around, that's when
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:36.480]   they want to come cuddle.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:43.460]   And, and I started noticing in my middleman, who's 13, I started noticing more of those
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:47.540]   tendencies over this past year, especially when we were out in public, he was real, you
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.680]   know, standoffish, standoffish.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.160]   Exactly.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.260]   And so I brought it to his attention in a real joking way.
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:59.400]   I mean, I was not coming down hard on him at all, but at home I told him, you know what,
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.880]   you have entered the cat years.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.060]   And he was like, and I explained it to him and he just died laughing.
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:09.720]   And now we have this ongoing inside joke that when he wants a hug, he'll just come up to
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:10.760]   me and quietly meow.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.240]   And that lets me know that he wants to hug.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.120]   That's awesome.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.520]   That's absolutely awesome.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:23.360]   I think that's really good that you've got a code that nobody else will now everybody will,
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.880]   but nobody else would know your code.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.420]   That's a way for them to, to show you, Hey, I'm tender.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:37.700]   I need a little attention without having to out themselves, which teenagers hate to do by
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.320]   and large.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:39.460]   Yes.
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:44.280]   I think that, and then I want to think, you know, this has been something my husband and
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.200]   I've talked about recently.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:51.160]   We, and y'all, y'all listening may think that we're kind of oddballs in this with 15 and 13
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:51.520]   year olds.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.480]   We still, we still put our kids together.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.560]   I mean, to bed at night.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.540]   We still will go in and pray with them and talk with them.
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.640]   And, but we were having the conversation because we know friends of ours who just send their
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:06.320]   kids to bed and we, my husband and I were tossing, you know, at what point do we need to encourage
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.200]   a little bit more of that?
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.420]   They've got to learn how to go to bed on their own.
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.460]   That's a life skill.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:18.140]   But at the same time, I, at least with our kiddos, that is the time that they open up.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.280]   They want to talk.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.740]   They want it.
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:24.440]   And I know full well, they're procrastinating bedtime because I used to do that.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.100]   I know.
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.180]   We know that trick.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.780]   It is absolutely precious.
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:32.240]   And I think that's a real crucial time for growing those relationships as well.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:37.220]   Leaning into those opportunities and grabbing when we have them.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:38.220]   Absolutely.
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:43.700]   Something, there's something about turning off the light, you know, because we did the same
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:44.500]   thing, Alicia.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.700]   We put our girls to bed for a really long time.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.660]   And that was the time that they most wanted to talk.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:54.740]   And, you know, it was also the time that I was most wanting to go to bed.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:36:01.220]   But turn the light off and they will start ruminating.
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:07.500]   And then you find out the hurt that has been lodged in their heart for the day.
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:15.520]   Or, and sometimes, you know, you put it there and you didn't, you weren't even aware and they've
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:20.920]   not known how to share it until the light goes off and it's at the end of the day.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:26.340]   And we used to ask our girls, I used to ask them three questions.
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:33.060]   And I will admit, it started out as staving off the, in 10 minutes, you're going to tell
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:37.080]   me that your legs hurt or your stomach hurts or that something.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:40.340]   And so I started out by asking them three questions.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:43.200]   Are you happy in your heart?
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.600]   So like, are you content?
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.780]   You know, is there something that has weighed you down?
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.600]   Are you healthy in your body?
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:55.700]   Okay, don't tell me in an hour that you had a headache all day, or, you know, that you
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.860]   felt like your throat was been scratchy for since supper time.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.160]   It's always nighttime.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:00.960]   I know.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.760]   I know.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.260]   So are you happy in your heart?
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.880]   Are you healthy in your body?
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.940]   But are you hopeful in your spirit?
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:14.100]   Because some days, some days you are just sad, and you don't exactly know why.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:19.440]   But as long, and you know, I had girls, and one of them was kind of dramatic.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.660]   And so one day she told me she had never really been happy ever.
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.540]   She was like 12 years old.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:26.340]   And I'm like, okay.
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.100]   And you just have to accept that.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:33.980]   But as long as you can see that tomorrow you might be happy.
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.280]   So you're hopeful in your spirit.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.480]   But you're right.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.280]   It's those connects.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:45.000]   So we ask them those questions at bedtime, because that was the time sometimes that we could connect
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.100]   on the heart level.
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:52.340]   And that was the most teachable moment to say, you know, I noticed that you spoke really sharply
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.400]   to your sister.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:58.960]   Or I noticed that you said something kind of snarky about your best friend.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.700]   Is there something going on that you'd like to talk about?
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:10.820]   I was going to ask you, are there signs for your kids that a heart issue might be at the root
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:18.100]   of a problem, even, you know, sometimes even might be the root of an academic struggle?
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.520]   Absolutely.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:24.600]   So what are some of the signs that you see?
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:28.180]   Negative emotions of any kind.
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.580]   Tears.
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:33.820]   Tears are quick, quick, obvious.
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.780]   There is something awry here.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.780]   And we need to pause and find the root of this.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:41.780]   sullen looks.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.040]   This Dane.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.820]   Oh, yes.
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:46.560]   Yes.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:56.860]   Just the attitudes, you know, all of those are clues that there's either a sin that I'm
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:01.840]   causing to be uncovered in them, and they don't like that.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.100]   And they're trying to, yeah.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:07.220]   Or, you know, it may not be a sin issue for them.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:13.760]   Like, sometimes with, especially my youngers, when they're younger, they, you know, it's
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.460]   a pride issue.
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.700]   They don't, it's so funny.
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:22.840]   I'm three for three now on kids who were greatly offended at the fact that they didn't already
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.180]   know how to do what I was teaching them to do.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:25.960]   Oh, my word.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.600]   Yes.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.040]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:28.320]   This is so true.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:28.960]   Yes.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.020]   I'm like, honey, you, I don't expect you to already know how to do this.
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:33.140]   Right.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.980]   I'm going to walk you through it and show you how.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.600]   And you're going to practice and guess what?
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.280]   You're going to mess up and that's okay.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:43.440]   You're going to be bad at it before you're good at it.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.300]   And that's how it's supposed to be.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:45.900]   Yes.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:50.340]   And especially with my youngest, I'm having to say some of those same things on a daily
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:52.720]   basis, which is exhausting.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.600]   But I know that she will get it because her brothers finally did.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:55.980]   Right.
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:56.420]   Right.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:56.780]   Right.
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.180]   And I'm getting a little sidetracked.
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.000]   I think sometimes it's a pride issue.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.620]   Sometimes it's a, I don't want to be led.
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.180]   I already know how to do this or I can figure it out on my own.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:07.040]   I do not want your leadership right now, mom.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.040]   I don't want to trust you.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:13.680]   And so that may be a hard issue to address, but sometimes it's fear of failure.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:19.520]   It's, oh no, I'm going to, I'm, I'm not going to measure up to your standards, mom.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.820]   And so either way.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:22.480]   What if I don't ask?
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.780]   What if I really, what if I really struggle with this?
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:29.660]   What if the other kids in the family got it right away?
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.480]   Yes.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.500]   That I don't get it right away.
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.640]   What if I just don't understand?
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.700]   Yeah.
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.080]   Yes.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:40.880]   And I think that goes back to what I was saying about how we get to shepherd their perspectives,
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.340]   right?
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:45.280]   Our perspective on a situation makes all the difference in the world.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:52.020]   And so if you understand what, you know, what this little piece of education is doing,
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:53.340]   what are we aiming for?
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:59.220]   And, you know, is a mistake a bad thing right now?
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.660]   No, it's part of the process.
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.120]   It's how you learn.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:07.660]   You know, so I think shaping and shepherding those perspectives is just a crucial part.
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:08.500]   Yes.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.800]   You are so right.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:16.180]   I think that a lot of times we inadvertently pass on to our children the idea that they have
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:21.160]   to get it quickly and they have to get it perfectly.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.740]   And then we'll move on.
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:31.320]   But really what we want them to do is make a, I finally told one of my daughters about something
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.380]   that she was working on.
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:37.160]   I said, my goal is for you to make all of the mistakes possible.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:38.880]   Nice.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.480]   Make all the mistakes possible.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.120]   Right.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.800]   Make all of the mistakes possible.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.780]   But then all that will be left is learning to do it the right way.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.780]   You will know all of the mistakes.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:55.920]   And then we'll just slowly work toward getting better and better.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.260]   And she, her little shoulders relaxed a little bit.
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:03.480]   It is hard, especially if one of your children was really good at something.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.840]   It, you know, if you're a mom of multiples, you already know this.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:11.940]   But if you're just, if you've only schooled one child and you have others coming behind
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:19.340]   them, whatever one excelled at, the next one will not excel at that thing or will not, they
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.820]   won't have the same learning style.
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:25.440]   So you'll think you were the best reading teacher in the world for your first child.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.400]   And then you try that very same thing on your second child.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.180]   And it's like, you're speaking a foreign language to them.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:31.920]   Yes.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.840]   Yes.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:33.660]   But it's okay.
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:38.180]   We, it is okay for us all to learn in our own way.
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.160]   We need to help our children.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.600]   One of the best gifts that we can give them is self-acceptance.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:50.220]   I think not measuring our worth by somebody else's performance.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.100]   So true.
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.440]   That makes me think of C.S.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:58.080]   Lewis in Mere Christianity, who talks about how pride is essentially comparative.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.980]   It's always looking at how do I measure up against somebody else?
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.780]   And, um, no, he's created us each one uniquely.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.500]   And we have our own gifts and abilities and limitations.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:13.860]   And it's okay to celebrate somebody else's strength and for you to be strong in other
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:14.340]   areas.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:19.140]   It takes nothing away from you for somebody else to be wonderful at something.
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:19.620]   Yes.
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:20.380]   Yes.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.580]   And that's a hard issue.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:23.900]   That's one of the hard issues that we're talking about.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:31.640]   And that, as parents, if we address those kinds of things in the home with our children as
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:39.800]   they grow, then what we shepherd eventually are adults who know how to love their world
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.360]   well.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:40.900]   Yes.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:47.780]   And that is so much more important than being able, you know, to find the square root of
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:48.540]   negative one.
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:49.320]   Right.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:49.800]   I'm just saying.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.480]   Right.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.920]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:59.120]   You know, one other, one other thing I would add to, um, to, as we help shape perspectives in
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:05.340]   our kids is I think there's a just fantastic tool in read-alouds.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.480]   Oh, yes.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.580]   I love that.
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:16.380]   Picture book biographies or biographical novels that tell stories of people who messed up a lot
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:20.560]   and continue to try and learn from those mistakes.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:26.680]   And I think stories can really help shepherd our kids' attitudes and perspectives, too.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.680]   I do, too.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:38.240]   They are great for building the moral imagination, you know, for helping children and teenagers
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:46.900]   and grownups figure out what we ought to do in situations which, God willing, we won't ever
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:47.500]   face.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:47.980]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.420]   But it develops our empathy.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:45:00.680]   It develops, um, our sense of honor, our sense of bravery, our sense of perseverance.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:08.820]   And it gives, it shows us what noble character not just looks like, but how it acts.
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.180]   And so I think that's really good.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:18.540]   And I love how the challenge books have been selected very intentionally to meet those very aims.
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:21.700]   I'm glad that you brought that up because that is really true.
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:22.320]   Okay.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:27.760]   I, I noticed, I mean, I just started looking at our time thinking, oh my, I'm enjoying this
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:32.360]   so much that we need to bring it to an end to a close for this time.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.700]   Anyway, I want to give you the chance.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.060]   I want to ask you this one last question.
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:47.400]   What to you is the most important message that parents send to their children?
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:54.620]   What, what's the most important message or lesson that we pass on to our kids?
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:00.740]   The quick, short answer for me is simply the gospel.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:12.720]   Um, but by gospel, I mean the, the whole worldview that understands that the God of the universe
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:21.840]   who created all things, created each one of us in his image, we are created with value,
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.960]   with worth, with dignity.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:33.340]   Um, and he made us for relationship with him and with one another, but sin has broken both
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:37.940]   of those relationships and we need a savior and praise God.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:44.340]   He has met our greatest need in sending us the savior, his son, Jesus, to pay the penalty that
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:45.300]   our sins deserved.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.300]   And so in him, we are forgiven.
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:53.400]   We are welcomed into his eternal family and we're redeemed.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:59.140]   We are, we are given his spirit that enables us to obey his call to be like Jesus and to
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:04.980]   love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to love one another as we love
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:05.400]   ourselves.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.920]   We can't do that apart from his saving work in our hearts.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.640]   And we can't do it apart from his spirit enabling us.
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:17.520]   Um, and so to me, that, that's the message because that's, what's going to make sense of
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:24.100]   everything else in our lives and equip us no matter what our children grow up and do, whether
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:29.880]   they're architects or professors or doctors or teachers or diplomats.
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:37.680]   If they know the Lord and understand what he has done for them, then they can do whatever
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:44.340]   they do to his glory and receive great blessing in the process and just the joy of being close
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:44.660]   to him.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:48.480]   So that's the message that I think our children need more than anything else.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.340]   That's beautiful.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:55.660]   That, that message fits them to be citizens of this world, but citizens of heaven.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:56.820]   Yes.
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:02.280]   And that, and that my friends is how you shepherd your child's heart.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:07.420]   And that is how you do heart first homeschooling.
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:13.080]   Alicia, thank you so much for being with me today and sharing your insights and your experiences
