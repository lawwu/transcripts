[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.340]   I'm wondering if you'd be willing to share with us a little bit about your mindset, maybe
[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.940]   even your motivation, but certainly your mindset around sharing some of the hard personal tribulations
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.820]   that you've shared.
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.420]   In preparation for this discussion today, I went back to some of those posts that you
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.820]   did and the podcasts that you did around this, and I'd listened to them at the time, and
[00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:39.380]   they deal with quite serious violations of childhood and of self, and they're hard.
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.620]   They're hard to listen to, and I can only imagine they must be even far, far harder
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.620]   to experience.
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:56.480]   And I was curious what led to your willingness to do that, and yeah, I mean, I have my own
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.700]   ideas about what might have motivated it, but I'd like to hear it from you.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.700]   Sure.
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.620]   Happy to talk about it, and I think there are two particular examples that come to mind.
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:15.940]   So one is my near-suicide in college, and if people search some practical thoughts on
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.180]   suicide and my name, it'll pop right up.
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.860]   I mean, if you just search my name and suicide, it'll probably pop right up.
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.720]   Pretty well indexed at this point, which is very deliberate.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.140]   People can look at the URL structure for a little wink and a hat tip.
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.780]   It'll tell you something about optimizing for Google.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.580]   If you look at it, I'll just tell you the URL, it spells out how to commit suicide.
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.100]   But clearly, I'm not teaching people how to commit suicide, but I wanted that to be a
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.180]   honeypot for some of that traffic, because it's a lot easier now to find that type of
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.120]   practical implementation advice, and it's a bit harder to find, I think, compelling
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.340]   intervention.
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.460]   So first of all, if you're feeling suicide, obviously call Suicide Hotline, please.
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.540]   That's sometimes the last thing that people want to hear when they are in a place of suicidal
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.460]   ideation.
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.900]   And the reason I ended up writing a long post about this, which was terrifying to write,
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.020]   because I had never told my parents, I had never told my closest friends.
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.020]   This was a secret.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.980]   It was a dark, dark secret.
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:35.140]   And I wrote about it because I went to an event in San Francisco.
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.940]   I was interviewed on stage by Jason Calacanis, who's a friend and a very good interviewer,
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.100]   at an event.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.620]   And after I got off stage, a bunch of people approached me and I was saying hi and taking
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.540]   photos and signing things and so on.
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.300]   And there was one young man there, very well-dressed, which isn't really relevant.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.620]   It was striking because in San Francisco, sometimes people are very underdressed and
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.580]   he had dressed up for it, like he'd taken it seriously and he was in a suit and tie.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.900]   He asked me if I could sign a book for his brother.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.060]   And I said, sure, no problem.
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.340]   And I asked him, what would you like me to write to your brother?
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.340]   And he kind of blanked.
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.740]   He didn't kind of blank, he totally blanked.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.860]   But the look behind his eyes was unusual.
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.840]   It wasn't just, I don't know what to say blank, there was something else behind it.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.180]   And I could tell that he felt under pressure.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.460]   And I said, no problem.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.460]   Take your time.
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.460]   I'll tell you what, I'll just chat with a couple of other people and I'll sign the book.
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.460]   No problem.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.420]   I'm not going anywhere.
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.700]   And chatted with the other folks and then he asked if he could just walk me to the elevator
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.700]   and then I could sign the book.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.380]   I was like, sure.
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:57.200]   And he explained to me, as I walked to the elevator, how his brother had been a huge
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.180]   fan of mine and that I'd really kept his brother afloat for a long time and eventually his
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.180]   brother killed himself.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.740]   And that they'd kept his room exactly how it was and he wanted me to sign the book so
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.100]   that he could put the book in his brother's room.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:25.060]   And he asked me if I'd ever considered talking about mental health and mental health challenges
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.380]   publicly because he thought it would really help a lot of people.
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.420]   And that just, I mean, I'm feeling myself tear up right now.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.460]   It was so crushing to hear this story.
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:45.140]   And totally unbeknownst to him, I had a lot of history with depressive episodes.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.700]   And when I say near suicide, I had it on the calendar.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.700]   I had a plan.
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.700]   I was going to kill myself.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.700]   I knew exactly how I was going to do it.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.820]   I knew where I was going to do it.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.340]   I knew all of the variables that I needed to account for to get it done.
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.420]   And the only reason that didn't happen for people who don't have the context, which most
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.840]   people want, is I had tried to reserve a book at Firestone Library.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.380]   This is at Princeton, which had something to do with suicide.
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.420]   It was like assisted suicide, like the clinician's guide to euthanasia, something like that.
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.180]   And it wasn't in.
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.500]   And I had forgotten to change my address at the registrar's office.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.860]   I was taking a year away from school.
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.620]   And that was to focus on finishing my thesis.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.500]   It was to try a few jobs.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.620]   But I'd ended up in a very bad place and was feeling very isolated.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.660]   And my friends were graduating a year ahead of me.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.020]   And I was stuck on this thesis.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.740]   And there's a lot of back story that I won't bore people with.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.860]   But it got to the point where I decided, not that objectively my life is bad.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.620]   I think this is where people who haven't experienced depression get a little confused or that it's
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.400]   hard for them to identify when they give advice to a depressed person.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.380]   Because you might say to a depressed person like, but look, your life is so great.
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.900]   Like there's this, there's that, there's this.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.700]   And for a lot of depressed people to say, yeah, I know.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.220]   I look at that and I can't fix my state because I am broken.
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.780]   And if this is how I'm going to have to live forever with being this broken and dysfunctional
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:23.220]   and to have this internal hell that I live day by day, I just want to escape.
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.940]   It's like someone jumping out of a burning building.
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.920]   It's like, they don't want to kill themselves, but they're jumping out of a burning building.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:36.860]   And so I had it on the calendar and thank God this is back when they would still send
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.500]   you a physical reminder in the mail, a little postcard that says your book is in.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.940]   And that card went to my parents' house.
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.580]   And my mom saw it and panicked and called me.
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.580]   And I lied.
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.300]   I said it was for a friend who went to Rutgers who was doing a project on A, B, and C. But
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:59.100]   it was just enough to kind of snap me out of the trance and realize that killing yourself
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.860]   is like putting on a suicide vest with explosives and walking to a room of all the people you
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.260]   care the most about and blowing yourself up.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.480]   So that snapped me out of it.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.780]   But no one knew this.
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.500]   This guy certainly didn't know that.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   And that is when I went home and thought about it and just decided, okay, there's a chance
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.900]   if I write this, it's not certain, but there's a chance that this might help someone.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:32.380]   It might prevent someone from doing what I was almost about to do.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.740]   And so I spent months getting this post written and put it out.
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.980]   And I know for a fact it has saved minimum dozens of lives.
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:50.240]   And there are other things, including a very extensive list of resources.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:58.180]   And so that gave me, I suppose, not a toe in the water, but sort of jumping feet first
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.580]   into the deep end and experience of being that vulnerable.
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.580]   And this was a long time ago.
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:08.660]   I mean, this is, I want to say at least eight to 10 years ago when I put that post out.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:18.340]   And then I want to say it was just before COVID lockdown.
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:25.260]   I was in Costa Rica visiting a friend, I was with my girlfriend at the time, and she knew
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.880]   a secret of mine.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.300]   And she was one of maybe two or three people who knew that I'd been sexually abused when
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:40.340]   I was a kid by a babysitter's son, from two to four, roughly, and routinely, all the time
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.740]   kind of thing.
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.880]   And what you're envisioning is what happened.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.420]   So it was not good.
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.540]   And that had been compartmentalized and locked away for my whole life.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.420]   I was like, that's in the past.
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.100]   We're focused on moving forward.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.780]   And nothing to be fixed, nothing to fix.
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.980]   And that was my perspective on things.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.020]   It turned out it wasn't quite that simple.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.260]   And so I had done a lot of work, a lot of therapy, used psychedelic assist therapies
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.480]   as well, which once again, are not all upside potential.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.300]   There are some significant risks.
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.940]   But I had come a long way.
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.180]   And my plan had always been to wait until my parents passed, because I didn't want them
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.500]   to blame themselves for this, and then to write a book.
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:44.000]   And there was something, though, at the time when I was having dinner with my girlfriend,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.100]   that was dissatisfying about that plan.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.740]   There's something about it that bothered me, and I couldn't quite put a finger on it.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.800]   And I was talking to her about it.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.140]   And she said, that's going to take a long time.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:10:02.900]   She's like, have you ever thought about how many people are going to pass away, or die,
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:07.620]   or suffer between now and when you publish that book?
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:15.180]   And I thought about it, and it was at that dinner that I decided to at least record a
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.740]   podcast covering this terrain.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.260]   I was not at all convinced that I wanted to publish it.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260]   I was terrified of publishing it.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:35.140]   Also because it meant opening myself up to a lot of conversations, or maybe just hurtful
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.140]   commentary online.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.140]   Who knows?
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.060]   There are a lot of idiots out there, and a lot of otherwise fine people who are idiots
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.060]   on the internet.
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:48.180]   So I was very hesitant, ultimately decided I didn't want to do it as a one-man show.
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.300]   I didn't want to make it a monologue.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.460]   So I asked my friend Debbie Millman, who had been on my podcast.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.980]   She's an amazing graphic designer and teacher, but she had unexpectedly on my podcast, based
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.420]   on some of my questions, for the first time publicly told her story about being sexually
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.780]   abused.
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:14.580]   And so I had leaned on her in years after that in private.
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:20.620]   And I asked her if she'd be willing to have a conversation with me about our respective
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:26.740]   journeys and what it felt like, what it looked like, what helped, what didn't help, what
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:33.260]   worked, what didn't, to provide at the very least a glimmer of hope for people who were
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:38.740]   keeping some of these dark secrets or contending with them, not knowing what to do with them.
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:44.420]   And we had that conversation, and I sat on it, I sat on it, I sat on it, and then I put
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:52.260]   it out and decided in advance that I would not look at any social media for at least
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.500]   several weeks afterwards.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.980]   If my team saw anything on social media or got emails, I didn't want to see anything
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.580]   other than positive feedback, which is not my de facto.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:10.180]   I'm usually eager to solicit constructive feedback, but in this case, I knew that my
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.100]   own position was too vulnerable.
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:22.740]   I didn't want to open up the possibility of destabilizing myself.
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:28.620]   And I put it out, and I think it's the most important podcast I've ever put out.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:35.140]   So I kind of felt like my job was done from a podcasting perspective after that.
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.580]   And it's been incredibly gratifying.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.100]   I think it has certainly helped a fair number of people.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:51.620]   And it was also really hard because what I didn't anticipate was I would say of my really
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:13:03.940]   super high performing close male friends, maybe half reached out to me to tell someone
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:09.620]   for the first time about their extremely awful graphic firsthand experience of being sexually
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.700]   abused.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.740]   The percentages were mind blowing.
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:18.700]   The actual percentages were super, super, super high, which is part of the reason I
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.940]   mentioned earlier.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:27.140]   I think it's good to spend a little bit of time in those empty spaces to see am I in
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:32.280]   a positive energetic sense pursuing something good or am I running away from demons whipping
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.140]   my back.
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:45.340]   And for a lot of those guys, I'm sure it's true for a lot of women too, they find medication
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:52.140]   through intense focus and achievement, which is super adaptive in a lot of ways.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:57.220]   But it doesn't always have lifetime reliability.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:02.400]   And that's the story.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:09.140]   It's impossible to hear those stories, your story, without feeling some substantial emotion.
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:14.380]   I'm not trying to intellectualize it.
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.860]   Both of those aspects of your history that you shared are huge.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.860]   They really are.
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:24.300]   They're obviously huge for you and they're huge in terms of the positive impact in the
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.300]   world.
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:33.920]   And I know this because I have read the comments and I've talked to people who have listened
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:40.820]   to those podcasts and read those blogs and have similar or maybe different stories of
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:41.820]   trauma.
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:48.500]   But I think as with your work in the psychedelic space, as with your work in the physical augmentation
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:54.260]   space, whatever you want to call it, it's apparent that you're willing to be first man
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:15:00.340]   in on a lot of things and really you're sitting alone there in those moments and these categories
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:06.260]   of revealing trauma are, in my mind anyway, so much more substantial in terms of their
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.660]   impact, positive impact.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:14.540]   And the other aspects for our body and psychedelic work, et cetera, is also tremendously impactful.
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.540]   So that's saying a lot.
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.340]   So I just want to say thank you for your bravery.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.340]   And-
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.340]   Thanks, Andrew.
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:29.180]   And it's crazy because I think that a lot of people can't imagine telling a story or
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:34.220]   to a close friend or something, but to put it out into the world, it's huge.
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.760]   You don't know how that's going to ripple.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:43.260]   And you've been a real pioneer and example for me, for Lex, for other people in revealing
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.140]   things not like that, but different.
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.460]   Peter Atiyah has recently been opening up about some serious challenges that he's had
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.040]   in his book.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.040]   He does that on podcast.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.040]   He's been doing it.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:02.020]   So yet another category, arguably the most important category for exploration and sharing
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.980]   and thoughtful bravery, because you didn't just put it out there in any form.
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:12.300]   So one thing I do know by experience is there's nothing weirder than being told thank you
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.980]   for the painful thing that you did.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.600]   So I don't want to push that too far, but I'd be remiss if I didn't, because it really
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.580]   has its impact and for doing it again here today, because so yeah, that huge thanks for
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.580]   doing that.
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:25.580]   Yeah.
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.580]   My, my pleasure.
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:33.300]   And I'll also say, you know, I got advice from a very, very experienced psychedelic
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:40.980]   facilitator at one point who said, take the pain and make it part of your medicine.
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:48.860]   And the way I think that applies here is we all experience pain.
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.380]   We all experience suffering.
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:58.180]   Many of us have experienced trauma of one type or another and that can consume you.
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.540]   I mean, it can consume you, but it's like fire, right?
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:06.660]   It can consume you, but you can also harness it and use it for different things.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:12.860]   And I know for, I think it's, I'm not going to hedge, I'll say I know for a fact that
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.580]   there are people I've spoken to who are suicidal.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:21.340]   And by the way, I'm not inviting everyone who's listening, if you are suicidal to reach
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.820]   out to me, because it won't work.
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.660]   I've had to disengage from that because it gets too heavy, right?
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.460]   Just to engage one-on-one with people who are suicidal, but there are resources in that
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:34.460]   post I mentioned, the practical thoughts on suicide.
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:38.860]   But let's just talk about closer friends, people you would never suspect in a million
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:45.060]   years who are this close to blowing their brains out.
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:49.180]   People folks would recognize in some cases.
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:53.540]   The fact that I was also there once is why they listen to me.
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:59.180]   Because I have, unfortunately, I'm a subject matter expert and I have credibility.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.220]   And that actually is very redeeming.
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.060]   It provides some meaning to the suffering that I experienced.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:11.460]   It's like, okay, here I am, for whatever host of reasons, I am put in this place in time
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:17.940]   with this person and they don't trust the input of these other people they're talking
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.260]   to because those people don't know what it's like.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.700]   But I can look at this person in the eye and be like, oh, I know.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.740]   And that's just a different thing.
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:37.780]   So you can find a way to transmute that pain into something meaningful, into a gift that
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:42.260]   hopefully you can share in some way.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.940]   Not necessarily with the whole wide world, just one person.
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:46.940]   That's a big deal.
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.600]   One person is a big deal.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.100]   There's a lot out there that is intended for mass consumption that gets in front of millions
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.100]   of people.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.420]   It doesn't really impact a single person very much.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.620]   So even if you don't have a podcast, you don't have books, if you have the ability to sit
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:04.060]   down with one person and really make an impact, that's actually more meaningful than most
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.400]   of the crap that gets put out there.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.660]   So take heart.
