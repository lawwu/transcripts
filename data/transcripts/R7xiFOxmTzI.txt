[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   Let's talk about strength and hypertrophy.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.600]   If you would, please remind us what strength and hypertrophy are in terms of the specific
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.720]   adaptation they represent.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.200]   What I mean by that is when somebody is training for strength, what are they really training
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.200]   for?
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.880]   Obviously, it means the ability to move more weight, but I know that it includes a number
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.260]   of other things as well.
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.300]   And when one is training for hypertrophy, for the growth of muscle fibers, what does
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.300]   that represent?
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.300]   Because I think if people understand that, they will far better understand the methods
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.620]   and protocols that are going to be best for strength and hypertrophy.
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.420]   At its core, you've basically described it.
[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.740]   When we talk about strength, we're talking about an actual function.
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.940]   So can you create more force across a muscle or muscle groups or total movement?
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.460]   And when we talk about hypertrophy, now we're specifically referring to just an increase
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.460]   in size.
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.260]   There's no actual mention of function.
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.380]   So a muscle can grow larger without actually technically being stronger for a number of
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.540]   reasons.
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.260]   However, there is a strong relationship between strength and hypertrophy.
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.820]   So a lot of the times in the general public, in the lay conversations, we sort of lump
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.060]   those two things in as the same thing.
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.340]   And so we have to recognize people who are new to training or people even who are intermediately
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.340]   trained.
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.780]   There is a huge overlap between strength and hypertrophy.
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.060]   Once you get past that though, they become disentangled.
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.220]   And a good example of it is this.
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.540]   If you look at the strongest people in the world, this would be people who compete in
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.820]   the sport of powerlifting.
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.420]   That's a true test of maximal strength.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.860]   So it is a deadlift, a bench press, and a back squat.
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.220]   And you're going to do a one repetition max in all three of those.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.540]   And so whoever wins is the person who lifted the most amount of weight one time.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.540]   That's it.
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.140]   It's not like World's Strongest Man where it is how many reps can you do in a row or
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.140]   your time, right?
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.540]   It's a true maximal strength test.
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.340]   And you compare those to say bodybuilders.
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.620]   Now both of those individuals are strong.
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.860]   And both of those individuals have a lot of muscle.
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.460]   However, it is extremely clear the powerlifters will be significantly stronger than the bodybuilders
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.460]   on average.
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.820]   There are individual exceptions, but we're just talking collective averages.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.720]   And the bodybuilders will have more muscle than the other ones.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.660]   In addition, whether you look at Olympic weightlifting or powerlifting or World's Strongest Man
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.900]   for that matter, there are weight classes.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.100]   And the reason is as you go up in weight classes, you will always see the world records go higher
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.420]   and higher and higher, right?
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.700]   So you can clearly get stronger without adding any muscle.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.460]   However, there's a point, right, where you simply have to add more mass to get a higher
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.460]   number.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.700]   And that's why we have weight classes in those sports and in combat sports and lots of other
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.700]   things.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.940]   And we have, there's a lot of confusion, right?
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.460]   Because people think, man, either these are the same thing or if I want to get stronger,
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.460]   I have to get bigger, which is not the case at all.
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.220]   Another misnomer here is I can't get stronger unless I add muscle.
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.220]   That's not true either, right?
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.420]   It's a similar idea.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.340]   So what I'm saying is you have the ability to do whatever you'd like.
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.420]   If you'd like to get stronger and add muscle, great.
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.420]   If you add muscle, you're probably going to bring some strength along for the ride.
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.460]   However, if you want to get stronger and you don't want to add muscle for any reason, personal
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.180]   preference on aesthetics, whether you're in a weight class and you simply can't afford
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.620]   it, it is quite easy to get stronger and not add much muscle mass either.
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.020]   And so differentiating these two things is one of them is simply a measure of size and
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.740]   the other one is a measure of force.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.260]   And when we talk about strength, what we're really talking about are two unique components.
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260]   Component one is what I call the physiology.
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.940]   So what is the ability of the neuromuscular system?
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.760]   What is the ability of the muscle fibers to contract and produce force?
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.140]   The other one is what we call mechanics.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.820]   Mechanics is simply things like—it's minutiae down to how long your femurs are relative
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.380]   to your tibia or other things.
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.700]   This is biomechanics.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.500]   This is also technique.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.540]   This is skill.
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.100]   This is how smooth you feel.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.120]   This is are you firing the right muscle group in the right sequence and order.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.020]   And all of these things play into strength.
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:26.180]   So somebody who maybe has more force capability in their muscle fibers but their technique
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.580]   in the movement is worse may lose in a competition.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.140]   Or somebody, again, who's—like if you go into the world of speed and power, especially
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.540]   you'll hear a lot of people talk about like the rhythm.
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.740]   And there's just a certain rhythm that has to happen if you want to jump as high as possible
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.580]   or run as fast as possible.
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.120]   But that's all mechanics at this fundamental level.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.700]   So when we look at hypertrophy, it's just still simply about how big the muscle is.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.860]   So those are really the similarities and distinctions between strength and hypertrophy.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:03.980]   [Music]
