[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.200]   Today's episode marks number 800
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.920]   in the Ask Pastor John series.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.920]   This is incredible.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.200]   God has sustained us in our technology,
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.200]   in our health, and our voices
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.640]   over these 163 consecutive weeks now.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.360]   And I know many of you make the podcast
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.820]   a part of your daily routine,
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.560]   and that is very humbling to us.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.440]   So thank you for joining us every day
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.360]   via your podcast app.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.960]   And if you're new to the podcast,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.120]   you can find and search through
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.560]   every one of these 800 episodes right now
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.480]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.520]   Well, many of those episodes are responses
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.000]   from you, Pastor John, to listener emails
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.400]   that come in, like this one today
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.160]   from a weary podcast listener named Steven.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.600]   He writes in to ask this,
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.280]   "Pastor John, please help this tired preacher
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.540]   "see the supreme sovereign hand of Christ
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.000]   "in the monotony of life,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.340]   "specifically when the kids are crying
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.100]   "and bills are stacked up to the ceiling."
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.080]   Pastor John, how would you encourage Steven?
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.160]   Oh, Steven, I hear four burdens,
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.980]   I think maybe five if I read between the lines,
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.580]   weariness, monotony, crying children,
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.660]   unpaid bills, and maybe,
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.020]   since he calls himself a preacher,
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.660]   a sense of guilt or desperation
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.780]   that I'm supposed to be a model
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.460]   of believing and heralding
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.260]   the all-sufficient truth and grace of God,
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.140]   and here I am under this cloud.
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.420]   So there's a financial burden,
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.500]   there's a fatherly burden,
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.520]   how do I handle these kids?
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.820]   There's a physical, mental burden
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.580]   of tiredness, weariness.
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.100]   There's a kind of malaise hanging over the life.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.860]   Everything looks like it's just the same old stuff
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.140]   and everything's repeating itself monotonously,
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.340]   and then there's the sermon,
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.460]   I've gotta get ready for Sunday.
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.640]   That feels, I feel it, I feel it.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.020]   And interestingly, and hopefully,
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.140]   Steven asks, specifically,
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.140]   "Help me see the sovereign hand of Christ."
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.540]   That's a good request, that's a good request.
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.340]   So he's in a good place in his bad place.
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.900]   He could have asked a lot of things
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.100]   that would have been less hopeful than that.
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.100]   So Steven, I wanna give you three ways
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.700]   to see the sovereign hand of God
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.700]   or the sovereign hand of Christ in your situation.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.400]   See his hand in his discipline,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   see his hand in his declarations of sovereignty,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.980]   and see his hand in his precious promises
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.980]   made to every one of your five specific situations.
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.500]   So first, see his hand in discipline.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.880]   Hebrews 12, five, "My son," Steven,
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.660]   "do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.720]   "nor be weary," isn't that interesting,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   "nor be weary when reproved by him.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.440]   "For the Lord disciplines the one whom he loves
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.280]   "and chastises every son," every son,
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   not just the bad ones, "every son whom he receives."
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.500]   This doesn't mean necessarily,
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.520]   I wanna make sure Steven hears this,
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.520]   this doesn't mean necessarily that there's a specific sin
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.260]   which your troubles are disciplining.
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.100]   According to Hebrews 5, 8,
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.100]   even Christ learned obedience through suffering,
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.400]   and he never sinned.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   So God may simply be forcing you in this troubled time
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.340]   to be more reliant, more fully reliant,
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.240]   more heavily depending on him and his sovereign grace
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.680]   in your financial and physical straits.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.880]   But, but, and I say this cautiously and earnestly,
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.880]   it is wise in every hardship to search our hearts
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.900]   and our lives for sins or for acts of carelessness
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.780]   that may account for God's putting us in this situation.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.300]   Is there inordinate spending beyond the unpaid bills
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.140]   or behind the unpaid bills?
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.260]   Is there careless financial planning?
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.560]   Are you living beyond your means?
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.900]   Is there simple negligence in not putting first things first
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.240]   and not getting checks written
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.780]   that need to be written first?
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.300]   Now, maybe not, maybe not, I don't mean to accuse.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.900]   Maybe there's been a crisis
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.700]   and the money was just all evaporated in a medical bill.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.180]   Maybe the church isn't paying a livable wage, I don't know.
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.300]   But all of those questions, I think,
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.980]   should be asked in a disciplinary moment
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.540]   where God our Father has brought us into hard times
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.700]   for our holiness.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.100]   Number two, see God's sovereign hand
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.100]   in the declarations of his sovereignty over your situation.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.540]   We see God's sovereignty mainly in the word of God
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.780]   declaring God's sovereignty.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.780]   So Isaiah 46, "I am God, there is no other.
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.260]   "I am God, there is none like me."
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.460]   Declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.460]   things not yet done, saying, "My counsel shall stand
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.300]   "and I will accomplish all my purpose."
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.100]   Ephesians 1:11, "He works all things
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.100]   "according to the counsel of his will."
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.740]   Proverbs 16, 33, "The lot is cast in the lap.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.300]   "Every decision is from the Lord."
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.260]   Matthew 10, 29, "Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.180]   "Not one of them will fall to the ground
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.700]   "apart from your Father."
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.660]   James 4, 13, "You ought to say,
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.660]   "if the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that,
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.420]   "pay our bills, whatever."
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.720]   Proverbs 19, 21, "Many are the plans of the mind of man,
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.720]   "but the purpose of the Lord will be established, will stand."
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.940]   When these kinds of declarations combine
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.860]   in the human heart with earnest faith
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.860]   in God's wisdom and goodness, a great stability,
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.780]   a great endurance is given in the midst of suffering,
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.260]   even the suffering of monotony.
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.260]   Lastly, third, see, Stephen, see the sovereign hand of God,
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:07.420]   the good, gracious, wise, sovereign hand of God
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.420]   in his promises to you concerning your specific troubles.
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.900]   So here they are.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.860]   I just look for promises that relate to your five burdens.
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:24.640]   Number one, in your weariness, he promises,
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.340]   "My grace is sufficient for you.
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.540]   "My power is made perfect in weakness."
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.060]   He has a purpose for this season of tiredness,
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.180]   and he will be made glorious in it
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.660]   as you count on his strength when you don't have your own.
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.660]   Number two, in the crying of your children, he promises,
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.940]   "Yes, he does, and you must believe this in your heart,
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.100]   "even if your heart gets broken by it.
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:59.100]   "Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them."
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.700]   These children, these crying children,
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.900]   these children who can grow up and break your heart
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.740]   are a blessing.
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.220]   Don't judge as the world judges.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.860]   Two o'clock in the morning, kid won't sleep.
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.420]   Don't judge as the world judges.
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.060]   The world will not call these crying children a blessing.
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.100]   You will, God does, and this is a matter of faith,
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.700]   and he promises they are a blessing.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.060]   Number three, your financial stress.
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.700]   "I will supply every need of yours."
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.100]   Needs, needs?
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:35.940]   Yes, I will.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.060]   "I will supply every need of yours
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.780]   "according to my riches in glory in Christ Jesus."
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.380]   That was the ground of Paul's contentment
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.300]   when he was brought low, like you have been,
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.520]   and when he was brought high.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.740]   And fourth, your monotony.
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.940]   I thought a lot about this, 'cause I don't like monotony,
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.340]   and yet I love monotony.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.340]   I love sameness.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.500]   I don't like, I wanna be at the study in my desk
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.780]   with everything exactly the same every time I'm here.
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.180]   Don't bring anything into my life.
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.180]   I've got work to do.
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.620]   I love sameness, but I know what it is.
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.960]   I know what it is to do a church, do a family,
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.380]   and feel like, will there be any breakthroughs?
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.780]   Will there be any fresh days?
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.300]   Will there be any new thing that comes about?
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.020]   Now, in Peter's day, there were people
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:31.020]   who were mocking the monotony of time
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.620]   as Christ did not come.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.900]   They said, "Where is the promise of his coming?
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.020]   For ever since the fathers fell asleep,
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:44.020]   all things are continuing as they were from the beginning."
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.300]   Same old, same old, same old, same old,
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.900]   and there is not gonna be any breakthrough
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.620]   into this world with a great new day of the second coming.
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:58.180]   That's just a lot of mythological pie in the sky.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.140]   Monotony, monotony, monotony,
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.620]   to which Peter answers,
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.500]   "Do not overlook this one fact, beloved,
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.660]   that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years."
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.700]   Translated into your situation, Stephen,
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.460]   that means God does not count monotonous repetition
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.540]   the way you do.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.060]   He has a perfect plan for you,
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.580]   and new things, inspiring things, encouraging things,
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.900]   breakthroughs will come in his time.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.900]   Your patience and your endurance are being tested.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.700]   Don't fail the test.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.900]   Get up, do what needs to be done.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:44.580]   Every day, the breakthroughs will come at his appointed time.
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.820]   And finally, with regard to preaching,
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.180]   he promises, "My word will not come back to me empty.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.740]   It will accomplish that which I purpose
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.140]   and succeed in the thing for which I sent it,"
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.740]   Isaiah 55.
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.860]   Don't preach your experience.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.580]   Preach the meaning of biblical texts.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.820]   They stand now, no matter how you feel.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.780]   Yes, they do.
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.700]   Don't claim to be what you're not.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.100]   Don't put on any airs.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.820]   Admit your weakness,
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.980]   but never underestimate the power of the word of God.
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.820]   You may be bored with life.
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.100]   God is not bored with your life,
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.860]   and he is infinitely excited
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.020]   about what he's doing in you and in this church
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.140]   and in the world.
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.180]   He's never boring, and his word is not boring.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.180]   It is infinitely interesting and infinitely powerful.
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.020]   So preach it, Stephen.
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.780]   He will lift these burdens in due time.
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.420]   - Amen, that is a great word for Stephen and for all of us.
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.100]   God is not bored with our lives.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.300]   He is infinitely excited about what he is doing in us.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.020]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.780]   Well, tomorrow, we return to look at a question
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.220]   over whether Jesus died on the cross
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.660]   to make salvation possible,
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.500]   or did he die on the cross to actually save us?
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.900]   That is an important watershed question,
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:04.940]   and we need to think through it
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.620]   because it shapes how we understand our salvation
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.100]   and God's purpose and role in our suffering.
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.020]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.860]   and I'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:30.060]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
