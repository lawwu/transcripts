[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780]   So Gina Wickman has a book called traction and get a grip on your business.
[00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.040]   It's basically a system for pulling all the different pieces of your business
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.860]   together into one cohesive system.
[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.960]   It's kind of like what I said earlier with the goals, you have your big
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.600]   10 year goal, maybe in a three-year goal.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.160]   And you track it down to a meeting that you have once a week with your team.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.240]   But in that meeting, I say out loud in that meeting, like last week, I said I
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.240]   would do blank and I blank like last week.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.960]   I said, I would call three investors.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.640]   I called two.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.360]   In other words, I have to fail.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.280]   I have to publicly fail in front of my team.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.000]   If I don't deliver on the thing I said I was going to do.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.800]   So by adding in that piece of the meeting through the book traction, again, we
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.600]   operate on this kind of system, but that piece of the meeting is I said I would
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.520]   do this, I did this, that holds me accountable because although I will let
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.640]   myself down, I don't want to let my team down, right?
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.560]   I don't want to let them down.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.840]   So the more I can obligate myself to things, the more likely the things get done.
