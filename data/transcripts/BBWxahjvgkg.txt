[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   One of the things that we've found ourselves is, you know, you buy ingredients,
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.740]   it's running late, it's expiring, throw it in the freezer.
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.920]   Is there an argument to just put it in the freezer right out the gate?
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.680]   I mean, yeah, that's basically how my mother cooked.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.160]   She was like first in first out instead of last in first out.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.800]   Sometimes I find myself doing the same thing.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.980]   Like, let's just say it was like cheese, a block of cheese.
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.100]   My mom would buy so much damn cheese and then freeze all of it.
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.480]   Buy a new block of cheese, take out the frozen one and
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.240]   and put the fresh one in the freezer.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.880]   I find myself doing some things like that, for sure.
