[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   [silence]
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.100]   There are now emerging methods that people are using
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.480]   in order to separate out the sperm
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.200]   that will indeed give rise to a male offspring
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.620]   versus a female offspring.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.680]   Now, this of course is done in the context
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.460]   of in vitro fertilization.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.760]   We haven't talked too much about in vitro fertilization,
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.940]   but in vitro fertilization involves, as the name suggests,
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.200]   taking an egg and taking a sperm, pairing them in a dish.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.820]   This can be done a number of different ways,
[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.900]   but just to briefly describe the IVF procedure,
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.560]   IVF involves administering supra,
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.280]   meaning greater than normal, supraphysiological levels
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.800]   of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.480]   during the follicular phase of a woman's cycle.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.840]   What that causes is the maturation of not just one egg
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.600]   that would be ovulated, but multiple follicles and eggs,
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.780]   and then ovulation itself is suppressed
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.080]   also through the administration of exogenous hormones.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.480]   And then under ultrasound guidance,
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.380]   an OBGYN goes in and collects the mature eggs and follicles,
[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.560]   puts them in a dish,
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.640]   and then sperm are delivered to that dish,
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.920]   and those could either be sperm
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.760]   that were frozen previously, or more typically,
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.080]   or ideally it would be live sperm collected that day
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.040]   that are washed through a very straightforward procedure.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.540]   And then those sperm either are allowed to compete
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.680]   for those eggs and fertilize those eggs
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.560]   and allow them to advance to a very early embryo stage
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.080]   before those embryos are frozen
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.320]   and eventually implanted into a woman
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.200]   in order to have them be carried to full-term, ideally,
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.120]   or there's a procedure in which specific sperm are selected
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.320]   because they have the best morphology, motility,
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.200]   and so forth, and in a process called ICSI,
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.720]   I-C-S-I, in which the sperm themselves
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.860]   are literally forced to fertilize that particular egg.
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.060]   Now, under those conditions,
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.860]   typically a couple or a woman,
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.100]   if she's doing this on her own with a sperm donor,
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.500]   will get multiple fertilized embryos, okay,
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.100]   that are carried to a multicellular stage
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.300]   so that it's clear that they could grow into a child
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.620]   if they were implanted into a viable host,
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.500]   sometimes the surrogate,
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.200]   sometimes the woman who wants the child herself.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.440]   And under those conditions,
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.600]   it is possible to look at the genetic makeup,
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.680]   including the karyotype of those early nascent embryos,
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.680]   in which case people really can select the sex
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.520]   of their offspring.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.760]   That is, they will have some embryos that are XX,
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.440]   some embryos that are XY.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.760]   It's very likely also that they will have some embryos
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.720]   that have karyotypes or genotypes which are not ideal
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.160]   in that they would potentially lead to a miscarriage
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.440]   or some other genetic defect.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.320]   And so typically people do not select
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.960]   to implant those embryos
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.840]   if they have the option to implant embryos
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.500]   that are of either XX or XY karyotype
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.520]   and the normal chromosomal arrangements
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.320]   for obvious reasons.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.080]   So the whole point here is that sex selection is possible,
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.220]   but only using in vitro fertilization.
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.560]   The other thing that is becoming clear to us
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.560]   in more recent years is that sex selection
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.960]   is actually possible at the level of the sperm
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.100]   even prior to fertilization.
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.240]   This is an emerging dataset,
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.200]   and this is largely happening in clinics
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.560]   outside of the United States,
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.120]   but there are some clinics that have figured out methods
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.160]   in which they can take a sperm sample
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.760]   and they can spin that sperm sample in a centrifuge
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.920]   at a rate that separates out the sperm
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.600]   into what are called different fractions.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.240]   So for those of you done a little bit of biology
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.180]   with centrifuges, when you spin any kind of substance
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.440]   that includes multiple things in it of different weights,
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.120]   when you spin them, the things of different weights
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.320]   segregate out into different fractions
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.440]   along the depth of the tube,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.740]   and then you can take out one fraction or the next
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.720]   simply with a little pipette,
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.840]   you take out the top fraction,
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.360]   the middle fraction, and so forth.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.200]   And what these clinics have figured out
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.480]   is that if they spin the sperm sample
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.100]   at the correct spin rate,
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.100]   that the sperm that will give rise to male offspring
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.520]   and the sperm that will give rise to female offspring
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.560]   segregate out into different fractions,
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.740]   allowing them to take each of those fractions separately
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.780]   and to apply them to eggs, if it's in vitro fertilization,
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.140]   and give rise very reliably,
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.680]   certainly much more than chance,
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.380]   to either male or female embryos.
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.780]   They also, of course, can choose to do this
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.940]   outside the context of in vitro fertilization.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.100]   So some people are now opting to have their sperm samples
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.600]   spun out in this way,
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.700]   separate out the sperm that give rise
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.140]   to male or female offspring,
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.420]   and then to only use the fraction
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.900]   that they are interested in, right?
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.460]   So if they want a boy, they'll use one fraction.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.820]   If they want a girl, they'll use a different fraction.
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.180]   And then to use those fractions in the context
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.540]   of what's called IUI or intrauterine insemination,
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.260]   which is, as the name suggests,
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.640]   rather than having the man deliver the ejaculate
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.300]   with his penis and the sperm with his penis,
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.300]   they have a device.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.380]   The devices are now commercially sold.
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.740]   Believe it or not, they're sold over the counter
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.580]   and on the internet.
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.900]   So people will even do this at home.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.020]   And so what they're doing is they'll take the sperm
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.020]   and they'll do IUI in order to bias the probability
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.580]   that they're going to get a male or a female offspring.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.240]   Again, this is something that's now emerging.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.780]   It's not commonplace.
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.180]   Most of the time, people simply roll the dice, as it were,
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.860]   by having either intercourse and just hoping for,
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.980]   or not caring if they get a male or female offspring,
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.380]   or in the instance of IVF,
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.940]   selecting male or female offspring.
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.540]   Sometimes, largely on the basis
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.100]   of the chromosomal arrangements.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.580]   So of course, some people might prefer to have one
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.940]   or the other biological sex as their offspring.
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.020]   But of course, the healthy chromosomal arrangements
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.900]   are going to be paramount for getting a healthy child.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.020]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.520]   unhealthy chromosomal arrangements
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.180]   or abnormal chromosomal arrangements
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.380]   often lead to miscarriage and/or birth defects.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.380]   So selecting for healthy chromosomal arrangements
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.660]   is always paramount.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.700]   But some people are selecting for biological sex.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.440]   And indeed, some couples who can conceive naturally
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.900]   are opting for IUI in order to be able
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.580]   to select biological sex because of this ability
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.880]   to spin out the sperm samples to different fractions
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.820]   and select the male or female sperm.
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.480]   That is the sperm that would give rise
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.760]   to a male or female offspring.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.780]   So this is a rapidly emerging theme, believe it or not.
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.100]   Who knew?
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.500]   And of course, it has nothing to do
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.740]   with Aristotle's assertions
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.020]   about what people are thinking about
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.540]   at the point of ejaculation,
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.260]   nor does it have anything to do with body position
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.840]   at the point of ejaculation.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.340]   But I do find it rather interesting
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.220]   that even in this day and age,
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.680]   people seem to be continually pursuing
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.500]   new and different ways to understand
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.420]   why one sperm or another sperm
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.500]   happens to fertilize the egg.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.100]   And when that information is not available,
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.580]   because frankly, it's not available yet,
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.860]   we don't know why a sperm containing a Y chromosome
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.280]   or a sperm containing X chromosome
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.060]   is more likely to fertilize an egg.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.480]   I mean, there's some ideas, for instance,
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.620]   that older fathers tend to have more daughters
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.840]   as opposed to sons.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.900]   But when you really look at the data, it's pretty mixed.
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.660]   So if you've heard that before,
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.660]   has a particular nickname
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.460]   that I'm not going to describe on the podcast,
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.720]   you can look it up online.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.660]   But if any of you are aware of any other kind of ideas
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.360]   or lore, no matter how ridiculous or crazy,
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.980]   please put them in the comment section on YouTube.
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.620]   I'd be very curious to learn about those.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.220]   (upbeat music)
