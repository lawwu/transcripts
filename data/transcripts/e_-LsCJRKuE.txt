[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   that we can share going forward with beginners as well.
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.840]   So we're going to be starting at the beginning,
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.480]   so nobody gets left behind, basically.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.040]   And one quick note on the material
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.440]   and how you're welcome to use it.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.720]   I'll be posting the slides in PDF format,
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.240]   and you're welcome to email them to anybody,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.200]   share them on the forum, use individual slides
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.240]   for any purpose you want.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.000]   Basically, use the material in any way that you want to.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.040]   So there's three primary things that I
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.320]   want to talk about tonight.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.920]   The first one is what I call the building blocks, which
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.480]   is basically the primary asset classes,
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.880]   so the primary types of things you would be investing in.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.320]   And then the primary types of accounts
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.920]   in which you would be likely to own those investments.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.440]   Next, we're going to move on to constructing a portfolio, which
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.720]   is basically the actual nuts and bolts decisions
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.840]   that you have to make in terms of what you're going
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.880]   to include in your portfolio.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.800]   And then I just want to spend some time
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.760]   on what I call staying out of trouble, which is basically
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.240]   avoiding the common mistakes that I see investors
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.320]   to make, both beginner investors and more experienced
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.440]   investors.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.520]   So starting at the beginning, the building blocks,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.560]   there's two primary asset classes.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.120]   The first one is stocks.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.200]   And I know a lot of you guys know this, of course,
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.960]   but again, we're starting with the basics,
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.960]   and we're going to go through it pretty quickly.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.760]   So with a stock, it's just the share
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.560]   of ownership in a business.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.680]   And the way you make money when you own a business
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.480]   is that, hopefully, the business earns a profit.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.240]   And when the business does that, in many cases,
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.040]   they will distribute that profit to the shareholders.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.400]   That's called a dividend payment.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.560]   And so you're just getting money from your shares, basically.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.000]   And the other way you can make money as a stockholder
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.480]   is that, often, when a business earns a profit,
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.720]   instead of distributing it to the shareholders, what
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.880]   they will do is reinvest the money into the business
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.000]   itself with the goal of growing the business
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.800]   so that it becomes even more profitable in the future.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.320]   And when they do that, as long as everything goes well,
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.360]   the business becomes more valuable.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.520]   And because you own a share of the business,
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.920]   your stock price will go up as well.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.400]   So those are the two ways you make money as a stock investor,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.880]   through dividend payments and price appreciation.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.760]   Just a quick note on terminology,
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.920]   stocks are often referred to as equities.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.360]   It's just another word for the exact same thing.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.040]   And the other primary asset class is bonds.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.640]   And a bond is just a loan that you make to a borrower.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.040]   So the most common types of bonds
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.840]   are treasury bonds, where you are literally
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.760]   loaning money to the federal government.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.280]   Then we have municipal bonds, where
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.040]   you're loaning money to a state or local government entity.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.600]   And then we have corporate bonds,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.880]   where you're loaning money to a business.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.800]   And the way you make money as a bond investor
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.400]   is the same way that any lender makes money,
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.860]   which is through interest payments.
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.880]   The borrower is going to pay you interest.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.440]   And bonds are in the category of investments
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.040]   known as fixed income.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.520]   Basically, anything that has a yield that
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.120]   is determined by a contract, an agreement-- so savings
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.640]   accounts, CDs, and bonds are all fixed income investments,
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.080]   although bonds are the primary fixed income
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.520]   investment for most portfolios.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.560]   And that's it for asset classes.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.160]   Mutual funds aren't technically an asset class,
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.080]   but they are still something that you definitely
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.200]   need to know about.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.540]   A mutual fund is basically just a pool of money
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.360]   that is run by a fund manager.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.860]   So basically, what you're doing when
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.740]   you invest in a mutual fund is you are turning your money over
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.820]   to somebody else.
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.340]   And then that other person, that fund manager,
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.220]   they will choose how to invest your money.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.420]   So they're making the decisions on your behalf, basically.
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.140]   And a mutual fund owns a collection
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.360]   of other investments.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.900]   So if it's a stock mutual fund, it's
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.580]   going to own a whole bunch of different stocks.
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.820]   If it's a bond mutual fund, it's going
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.620]   to own a whole bunch of different bonds.
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.320]   Balanced funds own some of both.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.520]   And then there's subcategories of mutual funds.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.840]   So there's mutual funds that only
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.880]   invest in a specific industry or that might only
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.640]   invest in stocks of small companies and so on.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.200]   And mutual funds can be either actively managed or passively
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.480]   managed.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.920]   With an actively managed mutual fund,
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.040]   the fund manager is actively trying
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.040]   to pick only the best investments.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.960]   So if it's a stock mutual fund, an actively managed stock fund,
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.060]   the manager is going to be trying
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.560]   to pick the stocks that have above average performance,
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.680]   basically.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.000]   In contrast with a passively managed fund,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.400]   the fund is just trying to track the performance of a given index
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.520]   usually.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.280]   Of course, that raises the question of, what is an index?
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.400]   And an index is just a number that
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.240]   reflects the performance of a particular group of investments.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.280]   So the S&P 500 is a very famous index.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.720]   You'll hear about it a lot.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.080]   And what that index represents is just
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.240]   the performance of the stocks of 500 of the biggest
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.880]   companies in the United States.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.960]   So an S&P 500 fund, it would be a passively managed fund
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.560]   because the fund manager isn't actively
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.800]   trying to pick the best stocks.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.280]   They're just buying all the stocks
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.680]   that are listed in that index.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.160]   It's a much more hands-off approach.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.240]   And that's why we call it passively managed.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.760]   The common use for passively managed funds
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.720]   is to track the total stock market, or total international
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.920]   stock market, or the total bond market.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.200]   And the two most common types of passively managed funds
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.720]   are index funds and ETFs.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.840]   And we'll get into the details in a little bit.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.560]   So the two big asset classes are stocks and bonds.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.720]   And the big difference between them is how much risk
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.800]   they involve.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.160]   With a bond, the borrower is promising
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.960]   to pay you a certain amount of money every year as interest.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.400]   And they're promising to repay the principal at maturity.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   So they're promising to repay the amount that they borrowed.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.560]   And the key point here is that a bond is a contract.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.760]   The borrower is contractually obligated to pay you money
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.480]   according to a specific schedule.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.440]   Whereas with a stock, there's no guarantees.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.560]   Because remember, with a stock, you just
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.760]   own a piece of a business.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.480]   And there's no guarantee that any business
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.480]   is going to earn a profit.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.320]   So you're just expecting returns.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.440]   You're basically hoping for returns.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.920]   And because stocks have uncertain returns,
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.040]   they also have higher expected returns.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.240]   And you can think of that this way.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.600]   Basically, any time that you or anybody
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.440]   has money available to invest, you always
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.920]   have the option of buying a bond, which would give you
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.200]   a predictable rate of return.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.160]   So why would anyone ever buy stocks
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.120]   with their unpredictable return?
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.360]   The answer is that stocks typically earn greater returns
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.080]   over an extended period.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.160]   So what this slide shows is the last 40 years, basically,
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.280]   from 1981 through 2020.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.920]   You could think of this as somebody's whole accumulation
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.680]   stage if they started investing immediately after undergrad
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.080]   and retired at the typical age.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.640]   Or maybe this is somebody's accumulation stage
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.360]   and their first several years of retirement.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.400]   And what this shows, the blue line is the US stock market.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.560]   The red line is 10-year Treasury bonds.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.280]   And the orange line is short-term Treasury bonds.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.480]   And this shows if you had invested $10,000
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.400]   at the beginning of this period in each of these three asset
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.480]   classes, this is how much it would be
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.840]   worth at the end of the period.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.960]   And as you can see, stocks grew by quite a bit more
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.040]   than the bond investments.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.560]   But stocks really do involve a lot more risk.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.680]   And that risk, despite what the last 10 years have looked like,
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.320]   it's not a hypothetical or theoretical thing.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.280]   It's a very real-world thing.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.400]   And if you're a stock investor, you
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.160]   will have to experience this at some point.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.040]   There will be periods where your stock holdings just
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.200]   perform terribly.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.040]   So this slide, for instance, is the years 2000 through 2002.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.640]   And in case you don't remember, that's
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.680]   the dot-com bubble bursting.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.720]   Internet-related stocks have gone up in value quite a bit
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.440]   in the late '90s.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.120]   And then people changed their minds about them.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.160]   And they and their stock market overall came crashing down.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.320]   And the red line here is the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:11.920]   Fund.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.080]   So it represents the US bond market.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.520]   And the blue line is the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.000]   Fund.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.560]   So it represents the US stock market.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.880]   And what you can see is that over these three years,
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.040]   bonds did fine.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.800]   They actually went up in value by 30%,
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.480]   which is a pretty good few years for bonds.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.040]   And stocks lost almost 40% of their value.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:37.520]   And it's worth noting that this is three years.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.040]   So if you're a stock investor during this period,
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.120]   you watched your stocks go down for a year,
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.040]   and then another year, and then another year.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.520]   And a lot of people during--
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.760]   at some point later in that window, 2001 to 2002,
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.560]   they basically gave up on stocks.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.400]   They said, forget it.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.200]   I've had enough.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.440]   They pulled their money out of the stock market
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.680]   and moved it into cash or moved it into bonds.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.480]   And that's unfortunate, because when they did that,
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.800]   what ends up happening is that when the stock market recovers,
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.960]   their portfolios didn't recover, because they were left
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.600]   in cash or just bonds.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   They weren't there invested in stocks when the stock market
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.600]   went back up.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.960]   And this slide here, it shows the period from October 2007
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.560]   through February 2009.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.120]   So this is the global financial crisis.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.320]   And here, again, the red line is bonds.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.520]   And you can see that they held their value, pretty much.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.760]   And the blue line is the US stock market.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.320]   And you can see that it lost about half of its value.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.440]   And that's the nature of being a stock investor.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.440]   There are periods like this that you just
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.360]   have to be ready and willing to accept them.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.440]   People often refer to it as the price of admission for stocks.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.160]   Basically, you just have to be willing to wait it out
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.440]   so that when the market does come back,
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.760]   your portfolio will come back.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.120]   And so that's the way that you can
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.000]   earn the greater returns that stocks typically
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.960]   earn over an extended period.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.200]   And another key point here is that this was--
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.880]   the last bear market that we looked at was three years.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.720]   This one was only a year and a half.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.040]   You don't know when it's actually going on.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.160]   You don't know how long it's going to last.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.040]   And you just have to be willing to wait it out, basically.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.840]   So that's it for the primary asset classes
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.320]   and the differences between them.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.600]   Moving on to the primary types of accounts,
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.680]   we have taxable accounts, traditional IRAs.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.240]   An IRA generally stands for Individual Retirement Account.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.880]   Sometimes it stands for Individual Retirement Annuity
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.720]   or Individual Retirement Arrangement.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.800]   But the key point is just that these are retirement accounts.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.200]   Then we have Roth IRAs, 401(k)s and 403(b)s,
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.400]   and Roth 401(k)s and 403(b)s.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.520]   And a taxable account is basically
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.680]   anything that isn't one of those other special types
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.600]   of accounts.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.200]   So a regular savings account is a taxable account.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.640]   Or if you go to a brokerage firm website and open an account
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.080]   and don't tell them that you want
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.040]   it to be one of the special types of accounts,
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.680]   what you'll have is a taxable account.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.760]   And we call them taxable because the income
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.560]   that you earn in those accounts is generally taxable.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.400]   So the interest is taxable.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.560]   There are some exceptions.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.600]   That's kind of beyond the scope of our discussion right now.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.040]   But for the most part, you have to pay tax on interest
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.040]   that you earn in the account.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.160]   Dividends are also taxable, but at a reduced rate.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.560]   So you're paying a lower tax rate
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.600]   than you would for most types of income.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.400]   And short-term capital gains are taxable at ordinary income tax
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.400]   rates.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.200]   A short-term capital gain--
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.920]   a capital gain is when you sell something
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.160]   for more than you paid for it.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.280]   That's why it's a gain.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.960]   And in this case, it's a short-term capital gain
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.720]   because it means that you held the asset for one year
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.240]   or less before you sold it.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.000]   And those are taxed at regular tax rates.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.520]   Now, we have long-term capital gains, where in this case,
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.440]   it means that it's long-term because you held
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.080]   the asset for longer than one year before selling it.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.600]   And those are also taxable as income,
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.120]   but they are taxed at a lower rate, just like dividends are.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.640]   Next, we have the traditional IRA.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.920]   And with those, there is a limit to how much
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.640]   you can contribute to that type of account every year.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.880]   For 2021, that's the lesser of your earned income, or $6,000,
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.960]   or $7,000 if you're age 50 and up.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.960]   And with the traditional IRA, in theory, at least the amount
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.520]   you put into the account is deductible.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.280]   However, if you have a workplace retirement plan, so a 401(k)
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.280]   or a 403(b), which we'll talk about in a second,
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.800]   then depending on your income level,
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.040]   you might not actually get a deduction for the contributions
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.280]   that you make to the plan.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.480]   The other big benefit, though, of a traditional IRA
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.960]   is that the money gets to grow tax-free
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.480]   while it stays in the account.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.080]   So you can earn interest and dividends,
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.920]   and you can sell things for capital gains.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.880]   And you won't have to pay tax on any of that
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.640]   as long as the money stays in the account.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.640]   But then when you take the money out,
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.120]   we call that a distribution, anytime you take money out
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.560]   of a retirement account.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.720]   And distributions from traditional IRAs
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.880]   are taxable as income.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.880]   So basically, you get the deduction
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.400]   when you put the money in.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.320]   Then it gets to grow tax-free while the money
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.400]   stays in the account.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.120]   But then it's taxable when you take the money out.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.880]   And if you take distributions before age 59 and 1/2,
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.520]   there can be a 10% penalty.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.960]   There are various exceptions to that penalty.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.800]   But the general idea here is that Congress
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.920]   created these accounts so that they
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.120]   would be retirement accounts.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.920]   And they put this rule in place, basically,
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.200]   to discourage people from taking money out early.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.120]   Next, we have the Roth IRA.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.680]   And they share a contribution limit with traditional IRAs.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.560]   So $6,000 for 2021.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.240]   So I need to right-click on it?
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.520]   Hold on.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.720]   Yeah, use two fingers to click on it.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.880]   OK.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.040]   And with the Roth IRA, you do not
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.680]   get a deduction for the amounts that you
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.520]   contribute to the account.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.080]   But the account does get to grow tax-free,
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.360]   just like with the traditional IRA.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.880]   And distributions of earnings, they're completely tax-free
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.120]   if you're at least age 59 and 1/2.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.760]   And this is a bit of a simplification,
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.000]   but as long as you've had a Roth IRA for five years.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.520]   If you take money out early, if you take earnings out early,
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.000]   there can be a 10% penalty.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.880]   And one important point about a Roth IRA
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.720]   is that the money that you put into it, the contributions,
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.080]   you can take that money back out tax-free and penalty-free
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.280]   at any age.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.040]   So if you're 23 right now, and you put $6,000 into a Roth IRA
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.680]   this year, and then by next year,
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.960]   that $6,000 has grown to $6,500, and it turns out
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.320]   that something comes up and you need to take money out,
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.360]   the $6,000 that you put in, you can take that back out
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.720]   tax-free and penalty-free, even though you're way younger
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.600]   than 59 and 1/2.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.400]   It's only if you took out the earnings.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.920]   If you took out the growth as well,
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.960]   that's where the penalty can come into play.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.920]   And the ability to contribute to a Roth IRA,
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.720]   it phases out based on your modified adjusted gross income.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.280]   So basically, if you earn too much,
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.840]   you can't contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:03.880]   There's a concept called the backdoor Roth IRA, which
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.400]   is beyond our discussion here.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.120]   But basically, if you earn more than the limits shown
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.560]   on this slide, that's something that you should look into,
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.680]   because it might be a way that you could effectively
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.240]   contribute to a Roth.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.680]   Next, we have the 401(k) plan, which
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.600]   is a lot like a traditional IRA, but it's through your employer.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.640]   So basically, the amount that you put into the account,
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.200]   it reduces your taxable income.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.880]   So you get some tax savings this year.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.760]   And the account gets to grow tax-free.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.120]   And then when you take money out,
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.520]   it's taxable as a distribution.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.080]   So again, that's a lot like a traditional IRA, basically,
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.040]   all three of those things.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.480]   One big difference is that there is a much higher contribution
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.880]   limit, so it's $19,500 for 2021, or $26,000 if you're age 15 up.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.640]   And another critical point about 401(k)s
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.140]   is that many employers offer what's
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.960]   called a matching contribution, which
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.960]   is where, as long as you put a certain amount--
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.040]   OK, hold on.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.240]   So as long as you put a certain amount into the account,
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.320]   your employer is going to match that contribution.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.440]   And that's a great deal, because they're basically
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.720]   doubling your money for you.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.960]   So it's a 100% return that's risk-free,
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.520]   which is obviously better than you're going to get basically
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.120]   anywhere else.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.680]   So if your employer offers a match,
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.000]   you want to make sure to contribute at least enough
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.920]   to get that match.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.560]   And for our purposes, 403(b) plans,
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.480]   they're basically the same as 401(k) plans.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.160]   Everything we've talked about so far
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.760]   is the same with a 403(b).
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.320]   403(b)s are just through different types of employers,
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.880]   so nonprofit employers and some government entities,
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.920]   whereas 401(k) plans are usually through businesses basically.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.040]   And then just like with the IRAs,
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.280]   we have the traditional version and the Roth version,
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.160]   same thing with 401(k)s and 403(b)s.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.200]   And one point of note is that your employer doesn't
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.920]   necessarily have to offer a Roth option,
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.800]   even if they offer a regular 401(k) or 403(b).
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.440]   And the contribution limit for Roth 401(k) and 403(b) accounts
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.200]   is shared with regular 401(k) and 403(b) accounts.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:14.120]   So it's $19,500 for 2021 or $26,000 if you're age 15 and up.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.760]   And because these are Roth accounts,
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.280]   you don't get a deduction for the money
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.120]   that you put into the account, but it
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.960]   does get to grow tax-free.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.400]   And as long as you're at least age 59 and 1/2,
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.640]   and as long as your first Roth contribution to the plan
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.360]   was five years ago, then the distributions
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.040]   are tax-free as well, including the earnings.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:39.440]   One point of note about Roth 401(k) and 403(b) plans.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.000]   Remember, just a minute ago, we were
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.280]   saying that with a Roth IRA, you can take your contributions
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.160]   back out tax-free and penalty-free at any time.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.600]   That doesn't apply to Roth 401(k) and 403(b)s.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.960]   It's just Roth IRAs.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.320]   With a Roth 401(k) or 403(b), your money
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.720]   is going to be more tied up.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.960]   And if you take it out before 59 and 1/2,
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.720]   you might have a 10% penalty.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.880]   So that's it for the building blocks.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.760]   We can pause here for questions if we want to,
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.240]   or I can move on to constructing a portfolio,
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.880]   the nuts and bolts decisions that we have to make.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.480]   Miriam, do we have any questions that we want to tackle right
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.120]   now?
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.320]   Oh, you're muted right now.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:25.600]   I'd like to open it up to the green.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.080]   I decided to open it up to participants for questions.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.520]   If you have one for Mike, you can put it
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.640]   into the chat or raise your hand, and we will unmute you,
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.360]   and you can ask it out loud.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.960]   Mike, I do have one question, and that
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.480]   is, could you discuss exactly why
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:53.360]   a stock and a bond are different under the hood
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:19:00.200]   for your portfolio when you go into those terrible bear
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.720]   markets that you showed on those graphs?
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.640]   Why is the bond--
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.120]   why is holding some bonds--
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.840]   what is it doing to your portfolio?
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.520]   It looks like the bonds are just cooking along,
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.200]   and the stocks are going way down.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.120]   So my instincts tell me it's just leveling out
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.720]   your portfolio more, but why is that?
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.280]   Yeah, that is generally the idea.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.720]   We'll get to that in a second when
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.000]   we talk about asset allocation.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.600]   But the reason is that bonds are a contract, right?
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.400]   The borrower is going to keep paying you
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.640]   interest throughout the period, even if the stock
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.760]   market is going down.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.760]   I mean, unless the borrower defaults, which can happen,
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.200]   but as long as you stick to high credit quality bonds,
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.360]   then you're going to keep collecting those interest
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.240]   payments year after year after year until the bond matures.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:57.920]   So they provide a return that is mostly
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.200]   independent of the stock market.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.880]   There are certainly some economic things
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.920]   that can affect both stocks and bonds, but it's a contract.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.040]   And the borrower is paying you interest every year,
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.880]   so the rate of return doesn't depend on the stock market,
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.840]   basically.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.800]   So basically, would you say that when
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.120]   you have these recessions, and the companies
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.040]   are having difficulty, so the price of their shares
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:25.160]   goes down, and even though it's a mutual fund,
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.360]   because it's a mutual fund of stocks, it goes down.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:33.760]   The value of each share goes down, so your value goes down.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.760]   But in a bond, in a bond mutual fund also,
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.640]   the value of the bond doesn't go down necessarily, right?
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.000]   And because it keeps paying interest,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.640]   it is actually keeping you afloat.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.280]   Right, yeah.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.280]   The bond's price, whether it goes up or down,
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.440]   it could be affected by whether the company or company's
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.560]   in question.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.240]   If their credit rating changes, that
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.440]   would affect the price of the bond, certainly.
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.200]   And it's affected by interest rates in the market.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.680]   But if you're holding a bond to maturity,
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.600]   you're just collecting those interest payments
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.520]   the whole time, regardless of what the stock market is doing.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:17.080]   And you're talking about, for starting out investors,
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:22.720]   owning bond mutual funds, not individual bonds themselves.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.440]   Is that correct?
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.400]   It's true with both, because a mutual fund
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.480]   is owning individual bonds.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.040]   That's what they are doing.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.800]   So in either case, you're basically just receiving
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.000]   that interest over time.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.920]   And the prices of bonds can move up and down
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.000]   based on interest rates and changes in credit rating
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.280]   of the borrowers in question.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.120]   But those fluctuations tend to be
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.520]   quite a bit less dramatic than with stocks.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.960]   And the primary part of the return is through interest.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.080]   And because that's a contract, it's very predictable.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:02.320]   So we did receive a couple of questions.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.960]   So one where bond owners are the creditors of the company.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:16.520]   If a company goes bankrupt, do bondholders get paid?
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.720]   They often do.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.720]   It depends on how the assets of the company.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.800]   So when a company goes bankrupt, it doesn't usually
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.880]   have zero assets.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.120]   It's got some assets left.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.120]   And it depends on how the assets of the company
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.400]   compare to the liabilities of the company.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.240]   But bondholders, as creditors of the company,
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.680]   they are one of the first parties
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.840]   in line to get a share of the assets
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.200]   that the business still has.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.560]   Whereas stockholders are basically the end of the line.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.440]   If a company is going bankrupt, stockholders
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.680]   are usually getting nothing.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.360]   But bondholders, they might not necessarily
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.720]   get the entire amount that they're promised.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:00.360]   But they'll usually be getting something.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.840]   Another question, what is preferred stock?
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.360]   Is this better than normal stock?
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.840]   That's a great question.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.240]   Preferred stock, it's called preferred
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.080]   precisely because of the topic we were just
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:19.440]   talking about in terms of the order of if a company goes
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.800]   bankrupt, a preferred stockholder
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.240]   stands ahead of regular stockholders
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.200]   in line in terms of potentially getting
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.760]   some assets from the company.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.000]   A preferred stock, it has a fixed amount of dividends
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.160]   that it pays.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.280]   But it's not a contract like with a bond.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.920]   The company can choose not to pay those dividends
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.320]   in many cases.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:50.800]   But the amount of dividends that the preferred stock
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.600]   is supposed to pay, the company has
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.480]   to pay those dividends to the preferred shareholders
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.280]   before paying any dividends to common shareholders.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.680]   So it's still an equity investment.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.160]   But it's a little bit more like a bond than a regular stock
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.480]   is because they generally have a high level of income.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.080]   And it's a somewhat predictable level of income.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.160]   But they still can fluctuate in value quite a bit
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.720]   just like regular stocks can.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.120]   And they don't necessarily pay anything
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.120]   just like regular stocks.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:30.440]   So if I have a Roth 401(k) for longer than five years
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.400]   and then roll it into a Roth IRA,
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.080]   do I have to meet the five-year rule again?
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.040]   Do you have to meet the five-year rule again?
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.160]   For withdrawals, the penalty-free withdrawals.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.960]   In that case, it depends.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.680]   It's the Roth IRA five-year rule that we'd
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.720]   be concerned with then.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.240]   So if that was the first time you opened a Roth IRA,
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.440]   then yes.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.400]   But if you had already had a Roth IRA for 10 years
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.160]   or something, and now you're rolling Roth 401(k) assets
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.800]   into it, then you've met the applicable five-year rule.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.720]   Mike--
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.400]   Can we go ahead and move on?
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.880]   Yeah, that's all the questions that I've seen.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.280]   If anybody else has any questions, post it in the chat.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.360]   The only other question, Mike, is about ETFs.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:27.320]   And is there a preference, ETFs or mutual funds?
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.560]   Yeah, we're going to talk about that in just a second.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.320]   Oh, OK.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.360]   I had a quick question before you move on, Mike.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.760]   You spoke about how interest is taxed at a higher
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.440]   rate than dividends.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.600]   Is it marginally more, or are dividends much more favorable?
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.880]   Can you elaborate on that?
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.000]   Sure.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.720]   Depending on your income level, dividends sometimes
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.720]   are taxed at a 0% rate.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.840]   So dividends can be--
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.680]   that would be quite different, 0%
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.640]   as opposed to the tax bracket that you're in.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.360]   However, as your income level goes up,
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.840]   your taxable income level, dividends
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.800]   will be taxed at a higher rate.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.880]   But no matter your income level, dividends
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.600]   are going to be taxed at a lower rate
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.600]   than regular ordinary interest income.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.440]   But the difference between the two,
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.160]   it's not a fixed percentage.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.600]   So sometimes it's a big difference.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.800]   Sometimes it's a small difference.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.800]   Thanks.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.120]   And we did receive one more question.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.200]   If you hold a bond to maturity, you're
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.360]   not affected by the price of the bond.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.280]   How does this work with a bond fund that
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.920]   does not have a maturity date?
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:46.800]   That's getting into something called the duration,
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.920]   is what we're interested in.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.040]   So the price of a bond is moving up and down
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.120]   based on changes in market interest rates.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.680]   And the duration of the bond fund
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.280]   is going to tell you how sensitive the price of that
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.000]   bond fund will be to changes in interest rates.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.560]   Basically, it's a rough calculation.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.400]   But for instance, if a bond fund has a six-year average
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.520]   duration and interest rates go up by 1%,
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.640]   then the price of the bond fund would go down by about 6%,
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.160]   so the average duration times the change in interest rates.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.920]   And so the longer the duration of the bond fund,
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.480]   the more volatility you're going to experience in its value
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.600]   over time as interest rates move up and down.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.400]   Can we go on?
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:41.960]   All right.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.760]   So constructing a portfolio, you're
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.200]   going to have to decide whether you
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.120]   want to use individual stocks and bonds or mutual funds.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.680]   If you are going to use mutual funds,
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.080]   you need to decide whether they should be actively managed
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.280]   or passively managed.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.600]   And you need to figure out what asset allocation
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.280]   you want to use.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.240]   So the big question there is how much in stocks
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.400]   and how much in bonds.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.200]   So first question, individual stocks and bonds
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.560]   or mutual funds?
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.000]   And the answer, don't bother picking individual stocks.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.280]   The reason for this is that the expectations for a company,
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.800]   they are already priced into the company's stock price.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.800]   That's a complicated sounding thing.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:24.520]   Basically what it means is that a stock's performance is not
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.720]   a function of how profitable the company turns out to be.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.160]   It's a function of how profitable the company is
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.200]   as compared to what the market expected.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.640]   A lot of people think that you just
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.720]   have to pick a profitable company
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.760]   to pick a winning stock.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.840]   So they look and say, Amazon, Google,
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.120]   those are profitable companies.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.040]   So surely those will be winning stocks going forward.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.640]   But it's not that simple.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.520]   Because to pick above average stocks,
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.720]   you don't just have to identify profitable companies.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.680]   You have to identify companies that
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.040]   turn out to be more profitable than the market expected
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.200]   them to be.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.480]   And that's tricky.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.040]   Because the market is, on average, pretty darn smart.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.640]   It's made up of a lot of professional investors.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.680]   And that's who you're competing against when you're
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.200]   picking individual stocks.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.080]   Because every time you make a transaction, if you're buying,
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.320]   there's somebody on the other side of the transaction.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.040]   There's somebody selling, by definition.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.200]   If you're selling, there's somebody buying.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.320]   And the way it works is that most
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.400]   of the transactions in the market
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.720]   are done by the parties that control the most dollars.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.600]   So most of the time, the people you're competing against here
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.120]   are hedge fund managers, mutual fund managers, pension fund
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.360]   managers, and so on.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.920]   And so you're competing against people
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.480]   who are probably at least as qualified as you are.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.360]   And they probably spend more time doing this than you do.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.200]   And they probably have access to information
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.440]   that you don't have access to.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.040]   Because their company probably has full-time analysts
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.160]   providing them information.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.480]   Or they're buying research from other companies
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.040]   that you probably aren't paying for.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.760]   So it's a competition where the odds are really not
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.960]   in your favor.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.480]   And when you use individual stocks,
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.200]   you're increasing the risk of your portfolio.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.080]   Because if you use a mutual fund,
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.840]   it's really easy to pick a mutual fund that
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.920]   owns hundreds or thousands of stocks.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.920]   Whereas if you pick individual stocks,
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.480]   you're probably not going to buy several hundred of them.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.520]   You're probably only going to buy a handful.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.280]   And so you're less diversified.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.720]   And because of who you're competing against,
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.000]   you're not increasing your expected returns at all.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.240]   So using individual stocks is a decision
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.640]   where you're increasing your risk without an increase
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.960]   in expected return, which is generally something
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.880]   that we want to avoid.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.320]   If you're taking on more risk, you only
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.880]   want to do that because you're going
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.280]   to be getting higher expected returns.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.840]   So most people should be using mutual funds rather
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.240]   than individual stocks.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.480]   And then that leads us to the question
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.720]   of whether they should be actively managed or passively
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.600]   managed.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.600]   And remember, with an actively managed fund,
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.040]   the goal is for the manager to pick investments
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.080]   that are above average.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:12.360]   And so we could ask, how often are active managed funds
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.040]   able to actually do that?
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.560]   And as it turns out, the answer is not very often.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.680]   Most actively managed funds perform worse
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.720]   than their passively managed counterparts.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.720]   For instance, Morningstar put out
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.640]   a study that looked at the 20-year period ending
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.320]   in December of last year.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.880]   And they asked, in each of these different categories
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:38.400]   of mutual funds, what percentage of actively managed funds,
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.640]   both A, survived through the period
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.400]   so they didn't get shut down by the fund manager,
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:48.880]   and B, they outperformed the average passive fund
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.120]   in that category.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.600]   And it turns out, for US large cap blend funds,
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.920]   so that's actively managed funds that
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:03.000]   invest in large companies, it was only 12.8% succeeded.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.400]   For large cap value funds, it was 16.8%.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.680]   11.3% for large cap growth funds.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.720]   8.7% for mid-cap funds.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.960]   29.6% for small cap funds.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:19.200]   So that's better, but still way below 50%--
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.840]   much worse odds of--
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.920]   you're much less likely to succeed than to fail.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.360]   And 14.6% for foreign large cap blend funds.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.280]   And then on the fixed income side,
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.280]   9.7% for intermediate term core bond funds.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.200]   So basically, your odds of success
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.120]   with an actively managed fund, your odds
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.440]   of outperforming the average passively managed fund,
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.480]   they're terrible, to put it frankly.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.240]   They're really quite bad.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.080]   Another way to look at it is you could
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.240]   say, within a given category of mutual fund--
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.360]   so international stock funds, for instance--
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.720]   what would be the best way to pick a fund that
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.840]   is likely to be a top performer?
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.680]   And this is what Morningstar's Russell Kennel--
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.360]   he's their director of manager research--
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.080]   here's what he had to say.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.800]   This is from a 2016 article.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.280]   He said, "The expense ratio is the most proven predictor
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.720]   of future fund returns.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.720]   We find that it's a dependable predictor when we run the data.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.280]   That's also what academics fund companies and, of course,
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.040]   Jack Bo will find when they run the data."
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:24.240]   Again, this is from a 2016 article before he passed away.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.520]   So he's talking about expense ratios here.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.560]   And the expense ratio is what the fund manager
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.640]   charges to run the fund.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.480]   And with an actively-managed fund,
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.800]   the expense ratios are higher because they're
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.640]   paying analysts, basically.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.520]   They're paying people to do all this research
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.120]   to try to pick the best stocks and best bonds.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.240]   And with a passively-managed fund,
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.080]   they're just buying all the investments that
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.040]   are listed on the given index.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.560]   So it's a much more hands-off thing.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.760]   And you can do it with a lot less labor, basically.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.880]   It's less expensive to do.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.680]   So passively-managed funds have lower expense ratios.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.840]   And from the article that the previous quote came from,
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.440]   what Russell Kennel did is he sorted funds into quintiles
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.640]   by expense ratio.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.920]   And he asked, for each mutual fund,
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.600]   what is the likelihood that that fund would survive and be
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.120]   a better-than-average performer?
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:19.320]   And basically, what you can see here
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.760]   is that the more expensive the fund, the lower the likelihood.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.440]   Was a 62% chance of success for the cheapest quintile of funds,
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.960]   then 48% for the next cheapest quintile, then 39%, then 30%,
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.680]   then 20%.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.520]   So basically, as the funds get more expensive,
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.360]   the less likely they are to be top performers.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.280]   And the least expensive funds tend
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.760]   to be passively-managed funds.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.160]   So they're the most likely top performers.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:50.480]   However, you don't have to worry about really small differences
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.560]   in expense ratios.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.760]   If we're talking about 0.05% versus 0.07%,
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.200]   that's not the sort of thing that's
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.960]   likely to show up in the performance
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.720]   in any meaningful way.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.200]   What you really want to be focused on
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:05.800]   is, if you have the choice between 0.05% and 0.5%,
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.200]   so 10 times as much, that's the sort of thing
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   that's going to make a big difference
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.480]   over an extended period of time.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:16.200]   And if you're using passively-managed funds,
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.160]   you'll have to decide whether you want
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.560]   to use index funds or ETFs.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:27.120]   And there is one important thing to know about this decision,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.000]   and it is that it doesn't matter.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.600]   It really doesn't matter.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.520]   For most people, there are hundreds
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.320]   of financial planning decisions that matter more than this one.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.760]   That's not an exaggeration.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.720]   The difference is the advantage of ETFs,
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.760]   they let you use orders other than market orders.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.360]   And if you're a new investor and you're
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.640]   wondering what is a market order and what is something
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.680]   other than a market order, you don't even need to look it up.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.040]   You don't need to worry about it.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.240]   You can if you want to, but it's not going to be important.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.800]   Another difference is that ETFs let
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.880]   you place a trade during the day and have it executed right
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.640]   away, whereas with an index fund,
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.480]   the trade will be executed at the end of the day.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.920]   That's how mutual funds work.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.600]   And again, that's something that usually doesn't matter.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:17.040]   ETFs sometimes have very slightly lower costs.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.720]   And that's an advantage, but again, it's
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.480]   pretty slight, and from one fund company to the next,
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.760]   it might not even be true.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.960]   So those are the advantages of ETFs.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.200]   The advantage of index funds, basically they
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.800]   let you place round dollar amount orders.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.120]   In some cases, you can't buy fractional shares of an ETF.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:39.120]   So let's say you open Roth IRA, you put $6,000 into it,
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.880]   and you want to invest all of that in a certain ETF.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.040]   You might only be able to invest $5,990.
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.080]   You might have $10 left over sitting in cash
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.600]   because that wasn't quite enough to buy another share,
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.200]   whereas with an index fund, you can buy fractional shares,
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.680]   so you can invest the whole $6,000.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.640]   But that's also a really small difference.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.400]   So seriously, this isn't important.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.000]   You could flip a coin to make this decision
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.800]   and then never worry about it again for the rest of your life,
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.040]   and that would be fine.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.840]   So moving on to our third question, which
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.200]   is what asset allocation to use.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.660]   The big question here is basically
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.000]   how much of the portfolio should be in stocks, so risky stuff,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.280]   and how much of it should be in bonds, fixed income,
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.320]   safer investments.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.040]   And this should be based on your risk tolerance.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.720]   Your risk tolerance has two components.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.360]   First, there's an economic component,
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.640]   which is basically how much risk you can afford to take.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.200]   And then there's a mental psychological component,
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.720]   which is how much risk you can handle psychologically,
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.080]   basically.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.160]   And on the economic side, for most people,
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.480]   at the very beginning of their career,
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.680]   their economic risk tolerance is low
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.800]   because you need to get an emergency fund in place.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.000]   Basically, you need a few months of living expenses
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.880]   and something safe before you start
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.320]   investing in something risky.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.840]   Because you could get laid off.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.760]   You can have an unexpected medical expense,
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.800]   an expensive car repair, something like that.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.360]   And you need to know that you have some assets on hand
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.360]   to pay for that sort of thing.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.720]   However, once you have an emergency fund in place,
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.720]   if you're early in your career for the rest of your assets,
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.720]   your economic risk tolerance is basically as high
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.040]   as it's ever going to be.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.960]   Because if you aren't going to be spending this money
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.720]   until 30 years from now, the stock market
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.560]   could go way down next week or next year or next month.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.840]   Then that would be fine.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.040]   It doesn't hurt you at all.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.720]   Because all that really matters is
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.920]   what your account balance looks like 30 years from now
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.960]   when you actually are going to be spending the money.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.320]   So early in your career, once you have an emergency fund,
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.200]   your economic risk tolerance is pretty high.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.680]   The mental side of things just depends
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.440]   on your personal experiences.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.040]   And it depends on your personality.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.920]   Some people are just naturally comfortable with more risk.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.080]   And some people aren't.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.240]   And it's important to just try to know where you stand
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.680]   on that matter personally.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.280]   What this slide shows, this data is from Vanguard.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:09.160]   It basically shows just the average annual return
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.560]   for portfolios at different allocations.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.520]   As we move down the slide, we get
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.440]   to riskier allocations, so more in stocks.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:20.560]   And you can see that the average annual return over from 1926
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.440]   to 2019, so a very long period, more stocks
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.720]   means higher returns on average.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.520]   But then we look at the next column too.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.480]   And what that's showing is exactly what it says.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.640]   It's the worst calendar year.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.920]   So for this given allocation, how much
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.640]   did the portfolio lose in the worst calendar year on record?
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.280]   And you can see that the more money you have in stocks,
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.560]   the harder you get hit when the stock market goes down.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.320]   It's pretty straightforward.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.360]   But the idea here is you want to try
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.640]   to pick an allocation that you can stick with, something that
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.400]   isn't going to exceed your risk tolerance.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.680]   Because when you exceed your risk tolerance,
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.000]   it causes stress and anxiety, which
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.720]   is detrimental in its own right.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.320]   But then it can have very negative financial consequences
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:02.920]   also.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.080]   Because just like we talked about when
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.280]   we were looking at a couple of bear markets earlier,
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.280]   if the market goes down and you start to panic,
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.280]   you realize you've exceeded your risk tolerance.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:17.120]   You're absolutely not comfortable with the losses
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.440]   you're feeling in your portfolio right now.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.960]   Then you take your money out of the market.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.920]   Well, then when the market goes back up,
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.520]   your portfolio doesn't go up along with it.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.400]   You're sitting there in cash.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.040]   So you want to pick an allocation
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:35.760]   that you can stick with, even through the down markets.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:39.000]   Now, we can next look at what a portfolio might
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.280]   look like in terms of an ideal group of holdings.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.640]   A common theme on the Bogleheads forum
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.960]   is the three-fund portfolio.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.600]   And I think it is a great idea.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.160]   It's basically just a total stock market index
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:55.280]   fund, or a comparable ETF, and a total international stock
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.000]   index fund, or a comparable ETF, and then a total bond market
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.840]   index fund, or ETF.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.840]   And with just these three funds, you've
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.720]   got everything you need.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.760]   Your portfolio will be extremely diversified,
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.560]   because with those two stock funds,
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.440]   you will own literally thousands of companies
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.360]   from around the world.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.680]   So massively diversified portfolio of stocks.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.960]   And your bond portfolio is going to be very diversified
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:23.280]   well with a total bond market index fund.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.680]   So it's everything you need.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:28.000]   And as long as you stick with funds from a reputable fund
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.840]   company, so Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab, for instance,
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.320]   it's going to be low cost as well.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.200]   And it's simple, which is nice because it
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.200]   makes it easy to understand.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.880]   Because the three funds here, they each
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.040]   represent something very tangible.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.480]   The US stock market, international stock market,
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.320]   and bonds.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.040]   There's nothing esoteric or weird here.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.880]   It's just basic things that make sense.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.920]   You can understand why they're each there.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.880]   And it's easier to maintain.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:03.760]   Because with any portfolio, what eventually happens--
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.960]   you'll pick a targeted allocation,
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.040]   but then some part of your portfolio
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.160]   performs better than the other parts.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.800]   So if this is the intended allocation,
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.840]   then it's going to be this.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.760]   You'll have a little bit too much of something
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.880]   and a little bit too little of something else.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.800]   So what you have to do is called rebalancing,
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.520]   where you bring the portfolio back
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.600]   to its intended allocation.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.240]   And if you only have three different [AUDIO OUT]
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.840]   that's a lot easier to do.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.840]   If your targeted allocation is 10 different funds,
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.120]   and it's 11% of this and 3% of that,
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.240]   17% of that, and so on, then it takes more math
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.920]   to figure out exactly how many dollars of each of those things
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:39.760]   you should have.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.120]   And it takes more transactions to do the necessary buying
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:42.680]   and selling.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:46.080]   So fewer funds makes that process easier.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.080]   And if you want to, you can go one step simpler,
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.920]   which is to just use a two-fund portfolio, where you're just
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:57.000]   using a total world stock index fund or an ETF.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.760]   So then what you're doing there is basically
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.920]   it's one fund that owns both the US
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:05.120]   and international components, and then a bond fund.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:05.920]   And that's it.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.840]   And again, that's a very diversified portfolio.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.800]   And it's going to be very simple and extremely inexpensive.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.440]   That would be a great portfolio, in my opinion.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.160]   And if you want to, you can go one step simpler,
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.960]   which is just use a target date fund.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.760]   Those are the funds with a date in the name.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.640]   So target retirement 2050 or something like that.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.840]   And those funds hold an underlying allocation
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.280]   of other funds.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.320]   And the idea is that over time, as they get closer
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.600]   to the date in the name, they move
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:41.320]   from an aggressive allocation to a more conservative allocation.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.840]   An important point about these funds,
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.000]   though, is that there's a lot of variation
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.640]   in the underlying allocation from one fund company
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.640]   to another.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.000]   So if you were looking--
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.600]   for instance, if you looked up the 2035 fund from six
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.080]   different fund companies, and you looked them up
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.360]   on Morningstar, and then you clicked over
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.640]   to the Portfolio tab so you see the actual asset allocation,
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.560]   they're not going to be the same as each other.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.880]   There's going to be a fair bit of difference.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.920]   So with target date funds, what you actually want to do
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.880]   is ignore the date in the name, as crazy as that might sound.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.760]   Just pick based on the allocation.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.440]   You just want to look at the underlying allocation
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.480]   and pick the one that looks like a fit for your personal risk
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.800]   tolerance.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.440]   Because you could find that even if you're
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:30.880]   planning on retiring in 2050, maybe the 2035 fund
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.480]   is a better fit, or vice versa.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.120]   So pick based on the allocation.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.200]   And just like with any funds, pay attention
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.840]   to the expense ratio.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.880]   Some fund companies have very inexpensive target date funds.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.040]   Some companies have expensive ones.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.360]   So if you can get a lower expense ratio,
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.680]   your target date fund is likely to be a better performer
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.920]   than if you have a high expense ratio.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.680]   And that's the second part of our talk.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.560]   Next, we'll move into staying out of trouble.
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.360]   So just some tips for avoiding mistakes.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.320]   We can stop here for questions if we want to.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:08.760]   Sure, we have a few questions here.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:12.120]   The first question we received, can you
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:16.920]   talk about 30-year Treasury bond yields,
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.160]   and why is that a hot topic nowadays?
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.440]   Gosh, I don't honestly know why that's a hot topic nowadays.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.360]   Because you know what?
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.520]   I don't pay super close attention
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:31.040]   to nominal interest rates.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.360]   I pay much more attention to inflation-adjusted interest
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.040]   rates.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.600]   Sorry, can't help you.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.880]   And why are those important?
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.120]   Why are those important?
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.200]   Because it's always real returns that matter,
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.760]   inflation-adjusted returns.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.240]   They go back a few decades to when I was a young'un.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.320]   And we had extremely high nominal interest rates,
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.640]   but we also had very high inflation.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:59.000]   So in real terms, bond investors weren't actually
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   doing any better.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.280]   And if you're looking at after-tax numbers,
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.640]   bond investors were not doing very well at all,
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:08.520]   because the whole nominal return gets taxed.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.280]   And so it's real returns that always matter.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:16.800]   And so generally, if I'm looking at interest rates,
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.920]   I'm going to be looking at TIPS yields rather than nominal
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:21.800]   treasury yields.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:27.640]   All right, next question.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:34.360]   Do mutual funds or ETS report performance net of expenses?
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:35.480]   Yes.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:39.440]   They should both be reporting performance net of expenses.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:47.520]   So if they do, if two index funds
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.720]   report the same or similar performance
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.800]   and have the same or similar accuracy in tracking
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:57.920]   whatever index that they follow, but with different expense
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.040]   ratios, why bother?
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:05.760]   Why bother picking-- well, if two mutual funds,
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.920]   you've got two index funds in the same category,
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.840]   and if you plot them both on a chart
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.080]   and they look like they're basically identical,
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.600]   they probably are.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.320]   And you probably don't need to worry about one
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.280]   as opposed to the other.
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.760]   Either one is probably going to be a perfectly fine choice.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:24.520]   OK, let's see.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:30.960]   Do I need a separate emergency fund
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.400]   if I have an invested taxable account that I
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.400]   can access when I need to?
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.000]   Well, I mean, that taxable account
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.640]   might be your emergency fund.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.720]   You need to know that you have assets on hand
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:47.320]   that you can get to in the case of an emergency.
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.360]   Of course, as your portfolio grows, yes, absolutely.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.440]   Just the bond part of your portfolio
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.720]   is your emergency fund, and that's absolutely fine.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:00.960]   All right, in reference to the three-fund portfolio
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.640]   you were discussing earlier, do we
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.320]   need an international bond fund?
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:09.760]   No, you don't.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.400]   With bonds, you don't need to diversify at all, actually.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.280]   You could just use Treasury bonds.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.120]   Because one of the primary reasons we diversify
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.880]   with stocks is that any one stock
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.760]   can go to zero because the company can go bankrupt.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.400]   With bonds, there's always the choice
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.800]   of Treasury bonds, which are backed by the Treasury.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.280]   And you don't need diversification at all.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.680]   If you're using corporate bonds, you do want to diversify.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.640]   And that's why, if you're using corporate bonds,
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.520]   you want to use a total bond market fund.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.680]   But no, you don't need diversification in bonds
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:39.560]   at all, necessarily.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.000]   So you don't need an international bond fund
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.360]   and, especially right now, if you compare Vanguard's
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.880]   total international bond fund to their total US bond fund,
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.680]   the yields on the international fund are lower,
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.600]   and the fund has higher risk.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:58.560]   So to me, it just doesn't seem like a very compelling
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:01.440]   argument.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.680]   I have a question, Mike.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:12.720]   Many investors think that, if they invest in index funds,
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:17.720]   they will be investing, and they will receive average returns,
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:22.360]   that an index fund gives them average.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:28.320]   But my understanding, an index fund just tracks an index.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.880]   If the index goes up, your fund goes up.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:36.280]   If the index goes down, your fund goes down.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:39.400]   What the index fund is is not average.
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:45.680]   It is following the index and keeping you out of trouble,
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:49.440]   because you have not tried to beat the index.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.360]   It's keeping you out of trouble.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:58.040]   And also, what you will never do is do worse than the index.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.960]   You are the index.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.440]   Never do worse than the S&P 500.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.960]   You will always be at the S&P 500.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:09.880]   Yeah, the idea that index funds are average
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.400]   is a sales pitch for actively managed funds.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:18.840]   And it's factually false.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.280]   The overwhelming majority of actively managed funds
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.760]   do worse than their passively managed counterparts.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.760]   We just look at those percentages.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:31.000]   So if you're looking at a fund that outperforms
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.480]   84% of actively managed funds, I don't know how
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.320]   you would call that average.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.560]   The 84th percentile is not average.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:44.080]   So no, the idea that index funds will only give you average
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:47.520]   is factually false.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:49.960]   There's no ambiguity about it.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.120]   They are better than average.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:59.280]   And also, on a target date fund, for young investors
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:02.920]   who are looking at their 401(k), for example,
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:07.520]   and they see maybe 45 or 50 funds,
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.680]   they see a huge list of mutual funds.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.080]   And they don't know what to do.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.600]   And they just want to move on with their life
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.200]   and just pick something that's good.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.920]   A target date fund is great.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:23.480]   And even if they just pick the target date fund for when
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:28.800]   they think they're going to retire at 65, let's say,
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:33.360]   from a good fund company, which most 401(k) plans are,
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.840]   that would be sufficient until they learn more
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:36.720]   about investing.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.760]   And then maybe they would tweak it.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.480]   Would you agree with that?
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.360]   Yeah, I think target date funds are
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.600]   a great choice for beginners and for people
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:46.960]   who aren't beginners.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:53.200]   I think target date funds are a very sophisticated way
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.400]   to invest, frankly.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:52:00.800]   They are a brilliant conception that with one fund,
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.800]   you can own this extreme level of diversification.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:07.360]   And as long as you're using a good fund company,
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.600]   low costs also.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.400]   And that's a fantastic product.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.760]   Yes, I think absolutely.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:17.480]   For people starting out, that's often a great way to go.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.520]   And it's a perfectly reasonable choice for people
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.440]   who aren't just starting out.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:25.120]   And also, since a target date fund then
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:30.240]   glides down through your life until you retire,
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.960]   it glides down in asset allocation automatically.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.360]   The fund company does it for you.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:40.280]   You don't have to decide, well, now that I'm 40 years old,
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.640]   I think I should be 70% bonds.
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.200]   Or should I be 20?
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.320]   Instead of making those decisions,
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:53.920]   if you really just want to invest it and not worry about
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.680]   it, the target date fund will take you
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:01.800]   into a more conservative asset allocation when you retire.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:05.800]   Yeah, target date funds are low maintenance.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.280]   They're not entirely hands off, because you should still
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.520]   check it every once in a while to make sure it still
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.360]   owns the things that you hope that it owns.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.160]   But they're very low maintenance.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.440]   That's great.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.920]   To that, I would add, they're also
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:21.240]   rebalancing in between the recalibration
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.480]   that Miriam's referring to.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:27.880]   So even before you get to the different asset allocations,
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:31.880]   you're rebalancing, which we know is critical.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.520]   So Mike, I have a question for you going back
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.200]   to the first segment, the catch up provision
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.400]   you mentioned where folks can contribute more to their IRAs
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.560]   if they're 50 or over.
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:49.440]   Is it that they're 50 by the end of the calendar year
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:51.720]   or 50 at the time of the contribution?
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:56.680]   So let's say someone contributes early in the year
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.880]   when they're not yet 50, and then they
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:02.320]   turn 50 late in the year.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.840]   What is the rule around that?
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.960]   It's the end of the year.
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.640]   So as long as they're 50 by the end of the year.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.840]   Yeah, age at the end of the year that matters.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.040]   In almost every IRA related case,
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:16.640]   it's almost always your age at the end of the year.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.160]   And that's a general tax concept.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.360]   Marital status also.
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.280]   If you get married in the middle of the year,
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.000]   it's your marital status at the end of the year
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.480]   that determines your filing status.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:28.200]   So for most things, there are some exceptions.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.600]   But for most things, they're looking at the end of the year
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.400]   to determine how old you are and whether you're married
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.960]   and so on and so forth.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:38.360]   Great.
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:39.760]   Should we move on?
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:40.840]   I think so.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:41.320]   OK.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.160]   Sure.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:42.680]   All right.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.400]   So staying out of trouble, which is really just some tips
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.960]   for avoiding common mistakes.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:51.800]   First, I would encourage you to try to keep a long term focus.
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.920]   A lot of people check their portfolios every day,
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.200]   and you don't have to.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.640]   And in fact, you really probably shouldn't.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:00.440]   And you don't even have to check it every month.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.440]   Because if you are, again, if you're
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:07.080]   30 years from retirement, what your portfolio does tomorrow
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:10.080]   or next week or next month or even next year,
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.360]   it just doesn't matter.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.200]   What matters is how much money is there on the day
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:15.880]   that you need to spend the money.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:19.520]   And so you can have all sorts of volatility in the meantime.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.520]   And that can be fine.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.040]   You don't have to worry about what's
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:26.440]   going on in the market over short periods of time.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:29.200]   Also, I would encourage you to watch out for recency bias
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.160]   in your thinking.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:35.640]   Recency bias is a cognitive bias that basically we all
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.280]   have as humans.
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.800]   And it's the tendency to assume that whatever
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.920]   has been happening recently is what will continue to happen.
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.760]   And so the way that affects us with investing
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:47.760]   is that when the market has been going up lately,
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.320]   people just assume that that's what's
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.520]   going to continue to happen.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:51.920]   And so like right now, when you've
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:55.840]   seen a whole bunch of years of good returns in a row,
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.520]   you see a lot more people who feel really good about stocks
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:00.680]   and their very high stock allocations
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:02.680]   because they're just assuming that the market's
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:03.840]   going to keep going up.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:05.200]   And then the opposite thing happens
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.400]   when the market's going down.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.440]   People just-- they feel bad about stocks
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:10.480]   because they assume it's going to keep going down.
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:13.000]   So you see people pulling their money out of stocks.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.800]   And both of those things are detrimental.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.440]   You generally want to pick an allocation
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.920]   that you can stick with and don't assume
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.920]   that whatever the market is doing right now
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.840]   is what it's going to be doing next week or next month.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:29.640]   My next tip would be to automate your investing to the extent
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.680]   that you can.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.440]   So with a 401(k), you can sign up
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:37.560]   to have contributions made from every paycheck, basically.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.960]   And with an IRA, you can set it up with a brokerage firm
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:41.400]   so that a certain amount is taken out
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:44.240]   of your checking account and put into the account every month.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:48.640]   And when you do that, you're automating your progress,
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.440]   basically.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.240]   A lot of people, what they do is they
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.360]   spend however much they spend.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:58.200]   And they plan to save and invest whatever's left over.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.960]   But when you do that, a lot of times
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.240]   there isn't very much left over.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.880]   Sometimes there's nothing left over.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.720]   And so you don't actually make any progress
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.120]   towards your goals over time.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.640]   But if you do it in the other order,
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:09.960]   if you automatically contribute every month,
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:13.520]   then you'll be forcing yourself to only spend the amount
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.080]   that you should be spending.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:17.080]   And you will automatically be making progress
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.880]   towards your goals every month because you
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.400]   are saving every single month.
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.760]   And just like Guruji and Maryam were both saying,
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.000]   target date funds automate rebalancing as well.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.360]   So that's another thing you can automate if you want to.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.480]   Every day they bring the fund back to the targeted
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.000]   allocation.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.920]   So that's another way that you can be hands off.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:40.240]   And the more things that you automate with your investing,
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.360]   the less often you have to check your portfolio
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:45.960]   because there's fewer things that need to be done.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:49.240]   And that's nice because it helps make it easier
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.240]   to not worry about all of that volatility
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:55.560]   from one day to the next.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:59.360]   My next tip would be to ignore the financial news.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.680]   The financial media's goal is just
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:04.520]   to get your attention because that's their business model.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.480]   They make money based on advertising.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.840]   So in the online world, they just want traffic.
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:10.720]   They just want you to click on their article.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.680]   And in the TV world, they just want
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.800]   you to watch their TV show so that they can
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.880]   sell their ad spots for more.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:19.680]   So every day there's a flood of information.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:23.480]   And recently it's been about Tesla and Bitcoin and GameStop.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.640]   10 years ago, it was about other stuff.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.920]   10 years from now, it'll be about other stuff.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:29.480]   But the point is that there's always
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:32.520]   going to be this information just hitting you every day,
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:34.880]   millions of articles it feels like.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:40.400]   And their goal is just to get you to click on it.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.800]   So they sensationalize stuff.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.440]   The headlines are written in a way
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.840]   to make everything sound really exciting or scary or important
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.720]   when it usually actually is not important.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:51.680]   It's not important information to your actual financial
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:52.880]   planning.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:58.360]   And if you can tune out all of that noise,
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.000]   it frees up time because you're not spending
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.960]   time reading nonsense.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:05.680]   But it also frees up mental energy.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:09.000]   And with that time and mental energy,
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.120]   you can focus on the stuff that really matters.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.760]   So in investing, that would be, are you
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.520]   saving enough every month?
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.560]   Do you have a reasonable asset allocation?
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.240]   Are you using low-cost funds?
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:22.800]   Are you at least making sure to get the maps in your 401(k)?
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:26.320]   And then there's a ton of other financial planning topics
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:28.600]   that are at least as important that don't have anything
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.720]   to do with investing.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:31.320]   Do you have disability insurance?
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:35.520]   And if you have dependents, do you have enough life insurance?
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.600]   And do you have a will that names
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:39.040]   guardians for your kids?
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:41.120]   Stuff like that that's really important.
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.920]   And if you can ignore--
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:46.400]   not be wasting any time and mental energy worrying
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:48.400]   about what your portfolio did today
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:52.040]   and what Bitcoin did today, if you can just ignore all that,
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:53.880]   you've got more time and energy to focus
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.840]   on the things that matter.
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:59.320]   And my last tip would just be to point out
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.000]   that there's no perfect portfolio.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.120]   There's no perfect asset allocation except in hindsight.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:09.200]   A lot of times when people first get started investing
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.800]   or when they first find the Vogelheads,
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.640]   they get analysis paralysis.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:17.920]   They get totally hung up on trying to figure out exactly
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.840]   the right allocation.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:22.480]   Should it be 25% in bonds or 30%?
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:26.680]   And should it be 30% in international or 40%?
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.680]   And do I need a small cap value fund?
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:29.840]   And do I need a REIT fund?
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.640]   And do I need this?
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.000]   And do I need that?
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.480]   And that prevents you from making any progress
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.680]   because you're trying to get it exactly right.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.040]   But you don't have to because there are plenty
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.480]   of good enough allocations.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.680]   The three-fund portfolio that we talked about,
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.480]   that's a great portfolio.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.160]   The two-fund portfolio, that's another really great one.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.680]   A target date fund, as long as you check the allocation
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.080]   and make sure it's a good fit,
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.800]   that's also a really great portfolio.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.480]   And any of those allocations,
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.880]   they're good enough to get the job done
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.240]   as long as you do your part.
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.800]   So as long as you're saving enough every month,
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.320]   and as long as you don't do something stupid
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.960]   like take all of your money out of stocks
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.760]   after the market has gone down,
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.520]   those allocations, they'll be fine.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.880]   They will be good enough.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:19.480]   And there's no best fund except in hindsight either.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.720]   A lot of people you see spend a lot of time
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.920]   trying to pick exactly the very best actively managed fund,
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.920]   but we don't know which fund
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.960]   will be the best actively managed stock fund
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.000]   over the next 10 years.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.240]   We only know which one was the best over the last 10 years.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.000]   But the good news is that, again,
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.200]   there's plenty of good enough funds.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.480]   If you stick with just the basic
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.080]   total stock market index fund,
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.400]   that's a good enough fund.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.160]   The total international stock index fund,
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.320]   that's a good enough fund in that category.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:55.320]   Just basic index funds or ETFs from a reputable provider,
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.840]   they're gonna have low costs.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.320]   They're gonna be diversified.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.280]   They're good enough.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.520]   They'll get the job done.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.240]   And so that's really all I've got.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.440]   I hope you got some useful takeaways
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.440]   in terms of the building blocks of a portfolio
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.440]   and the actual decisions
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.000]   in terms of what to include,
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.560]   and then hopefully some useful tips
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.800]   for avoiding the common mistakes that we see.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:24.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
