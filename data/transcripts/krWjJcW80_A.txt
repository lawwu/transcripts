[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180]   Weights and Biases is the developer stack for machine learning practitioners.
[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.780]   Use these lightweight, interoperable tools for the entire lifecycle of your machine learning
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.780]   projects.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.060]   Experiment tracking, hyperparameter optimization, dataset and model versioning, even sharing
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.060]   results.
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.020]   WB is trusted by over 70,000 machine learning practitioners, delivering better medicine,
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.060]   safer self-driving cars, more sustainable farming, technologies that build a better
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.620]   collective future.
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.060]   You can easily capture all the information you need to make your models reproducible.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.860]   Your future self will thank you.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.620]   Start with tracking metrics for a single experiment, then compare hundreds of experiments, visualize
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.860]   thousands of predictions, and share the insights you've gained.
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.060]   Take your existing ML code, regardless of what framework you're using, add a lightweight
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.220]   WNB integration, and quickly get live metrics, terminal logs, and system stats streamed to
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.820]   the centralized dashboard.
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.420]   WNB also organizes the results of entire projects.
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.820]   Even if you and your team tried thousands of experiments, you can still painlessly access
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.140]   the results in a single place, from any device, at any time, and query and filter results
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.100]   to spot issues and trends.
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.660]   Track your progress towards the optimal model, take notes on your results across experiments,
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.760]   and share findings with collaborators.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.060]   Capture the valuable research efforts and insights that are often lost over time, or
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.980]   when a team member leaves.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.180]   Everything is built to empower collaboration.
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.660]   Just imagine what your team could do with a shared tool for dataset versioning, model
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.460]   management, experiment tracking, and hyperparameter schemes.
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.740]   That's a quick summary of Weights & Biases, the flexible, lightweight developer stack
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.680]   for machine learning practitioners.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.380]   Get started now and see live results in just 5 minutes.
