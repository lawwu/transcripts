[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.920]   And in this episode, I want to talk about how I started investing in private funds,
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.080]   specifically venture debt and venture capital.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.520]   Because I published a post called "How I'd Invest $1 Million Today."
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.200]   And I think you should take a look at it, because I've gone through a series of how
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:27.560]   I'd invest $100,000, how I'd invest $250,000, and now how I'd invest $1 million.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.240]   And I know not too many folks have a million dollars to invest, but I thought it was a
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.720]   good exercise to go through, given we're in this interesting time in the stock market,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.040]   the real estate market, and alternative investments.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.240]   But onto the topic of how I started investing in venture capital and venture debt.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.960]   It all comes down to relationships.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.620]   It really does.
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.080]   My first venture debt investing was, I would say, 10 years ago now.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.520]   And the reason why I started investing in venture debt was because my business school
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.120]   classmate decided to go into venture debt after business school.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.720]   And then he was at a large venture debt company for, I think, five years.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.400]   And then he started to start his own.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.320]   He wanted to start his own venture debt business.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.520]   And because we were friends, I said, OK, well, let me invest in your initial fund.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.840]   And that was a leap of faith on my part, because he'd never run a fund before.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.720]   He had the experience working in venture debt.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.580]   I knew he was smart, because he went to UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business.
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.440]   And I liked him, because I've known him for years.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.960]   And so I invested in his first fund, which I think ended up doing OK.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.320]   It was only like 8%.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.040]   It was nothing spectacular.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.620]   He had a couple of misses.
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.780]   But overall, it returned capital to initial shareholders.
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.640]   And then, because of that, he was able to launch a second fund, and a third fund, and
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.160]   a fourth fund.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.640]   And with the fourth fund, he started getting significant institutional investors.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.520]   So the fourth fund, I think, was over $250 million in size, whereas the first fund was,
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.920]   I think it was something like $50 million in size.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.680]   So the fund sizes started going up, and the opportunities started going up based on his
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.120]   track record.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.340]   So now, the venture debt fund is in good shape.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.600]   And so for those who started with him in the beginning, they will always have a look, because
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.400]   there is a lot of demand-- or at least there was a lot of demand before 2022, because they
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.980]   haven't raised a new fund, a fifth fund, since the bear market yet.
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.580]   And so for those who've been with the fund since the beginning, they'll always get a
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.880]   first look, because a lot of demand comes from institutional investors now.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.480]   And for folks writing a $250,000 check, it's not going to move the difference in a $500
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.320]   million fund, let's say.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.600]   They want to get an institutional investor who invests $50 million, $100 million, a family
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.200]   office, those type of folks.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.360]   It's just a different level of business now.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.440]   In terms of investing in a venture capital fund, now, this is also due to relationships.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.600]   I have a 10-plus-year-long friend who has been an angel investor and an investor in
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.400]   different venture capital funds over the years.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.840]   And due to his network, he invited me along and said, hey, I have an old co-worker who
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.720]   started a fund or a second fund.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.720]   Would you like to invest?
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.280]   And I took a look, and I said, yeah, why not?
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.280]   Let's invest.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.600]   And so I was actually at one of the parties of a venture capital fund hosted at the San
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.120]   Francisco Giants game the other night.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.360]   And there, there were probably 70, 80 people-- entrepreneurs, limited partners, and the general
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.360]   partners.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.280]   And from there, you just talk to people.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.920]   I learned about a new AI investment they had invested in.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.560]   It has to do with making new types of music by combining different types of music into
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.340]   one to create a new song or a new melody.
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.840]   And I thought that was really interesting.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.120]   And the fund that I'm investing in invested in that.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.160]   And so did Diplo and the Chainsmokers.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.840]   Oh, that's pretty interesting.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.200]   So there was the founder there.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.560]   Get to talk to him.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.240]   And then talk to other investors who have been investing in other types of businesses.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.360]   And you basically just build relationships.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.440]   You be a good person.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.440]   You trade information.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.860]   And you just keep in touch.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.600]   Another example of networking is that I was at a tennis tournament a couple months ago.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.800]   And several of the people who showed up were VCs.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.880]   So I showed interest in what they were investing in-- new technologies, new trends, what's
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.840]   going on, what's the hardest thing about being a VC.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.100]   And by showing interest in what someone is doing, they show interest back.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.100]   And then they ask, what you're doing?
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.600]   And I say, oh, I run this site called Financial Samurai.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   It has a platform.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   And they're like, oh, really?
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.360]   Well, we have these people who are called scouts who have these large social media followings
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.600]   who try to find deals.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.860]   And if they bring a deal to us and we invest in those deals, they will earn some carry.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.200]   And that carry will pay out if the company is successful.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.560]   And that's how these things happen.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.960]   And then finally, another example of networking is that I met a dad who started a fintech
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.720]   company-- I think it was like 10, 12 years ago.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.720]   And they sold it.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.800]   They sold it to a large financial institution that we've all heard of.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.600]   And their incubator is a very famous incubator here in the San Francisco Bay Area.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.280]   So he gets to invest in a lot of the private companies the incubator invests in, as well
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.640]   as the funds of the incubator.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.760]   Not only that, because he is an accomplished entrepreneur, he gets looks in the fintech
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.120]   space, in artificial intelligence, in health tech, in all sorts of different areas that
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.240]   he's interested in and that he has an experience in all across the country.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.720]   So if you want to invest in top venture debt or venture capital or private equity funds,
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.280]   it's really about networking.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.720]   It's about being a good person.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.360]   It's about adding value somehow.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.120]   Because capital, there's a lot of capital out there.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.580]   And there's not a lot of space.
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.720]   The funds can only raise so much because they say, look, I'm going to target raising a billion
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.920]   dollar fund.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.960]   They can't just say, OK, there's $3 billion in demand.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.960]   Let's raise that.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.040]   I mean, they can obviously raise the amount higher than the initial target.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.760]   But there has to be some discipline here.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.600]   Because if the fund gets too large, then it's harder to put as much capital to work and
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.640]   get a positive return.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.040]   I also want to emphasize being able to add value.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.400]   I think about this a lot because I think about recently college admissions.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.280]   A lot of people have top test scores, top GPAs.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.180]   So what's unique about them?
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.180]   You have to have something that stands out.
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.780]   So if there's so much demand trying to get into one of the top funds, you need to offer
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.320]   something of value.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:12.320]   So for example, if you are a successful entrepreneur who's been through seed to exit, I mean, that's
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320]   phenomenal.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.680]   And you probably have the experience to consult and provide guidance for some of the companies
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.100]   in the portfolio.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.680]   That adds value.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.000]   Let's say you have a huge social media following and can help amplify the message of one of
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.740]   the companies the fund invested in.
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.160]   That has huge value.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.200]   And I was thinking about from my point of view, if you have a large personal finance
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:42.340]   site and you want to invest in a fund that has several fintech investments, hey, I could
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.200]   add value to that fund as well.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.520]   My problem is that I don't have that hunger, that drive anymore to make a lot of money,
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.920]   which is part of the reason why I'm investing in these funds in the first place, because
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.920]   I want people who have that hunger, who have that competitive advantage and that network
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:06.280]   to find those deals for me, of course, and then in return, I just pay them their fee.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:12.520]   You know, this hunger, this hunger to earn, to invest, to discover really takes, I think,
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.080]   a special someone.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:20.240]   And your hunger to make more money is higher in your 20s and 30s than it is in your 40s,
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:26.200]   50s, and 60s, because rationally, most people have less money right out of school and they
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.680]   want to make that money.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.120]   And so this is something to think about as you invest going forward.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.240]   Your desire to make money will probably fade as you have more money.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.320]   And therefore, if you are a self-directed investor, maybe you'll start slacking off
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.320]   a little bit.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.280]   Maybe you won't asset allocate as appropriately.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.680]   Maybe you'll just get a little sloppy in terms of your risk exposure, right, which could
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.000]   be dangerous.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.840]   And so that is a case as you get wealthier to outsource your wealth to people whose profession,
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:04.800]   whose day job 24/7, hopefully not 24/7, but at least 40 hours a week is to ensure that
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.720]   your capital is being optimized.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.660]   Just the other day, instead of, I don't know, networking, doing business development, writing
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.280]   on Financial Samurai or podcasting, I spent three hours with my three and a half year
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.120]   old daughter at the zoo.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.800]   We saw all the animals.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.560]   We said hi to Norman, her favorite gorilla.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.480]   We said hi to the giraffes.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.400]   And then afterwards, we went to take the train, the little puffer train at the San Francisco
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.400]   Zoo.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.000]   And it was just like a magical moment.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.120]   It was just father, daughter, enjoying the breeze in our air and hearing the choo-choo
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.200]   and the steam on our face.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.840]   It was great and we did it again.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.040]   And then we went to the playground and played for an hour.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:52.000]   And it's just like these moments, they're just so much more valuable than trying to
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.440]   look at my portfolio to optimize and make more money.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.720]   So to be able to outsource your capital to the people who do this for a living, I think
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.160]   becomes more and more valuable as you get older and wealthier.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:11.560]   There is one final point I want to make and that is our network, I think, is way stronger,
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.000]   way more powerful than we know.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.680]   I'm looking at my own network.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.000]   If tens of thousands of people listen to this podcast and a million people read Financial
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.280]   Samurai every single month, surely there are people in the venture capital, venture debt,
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.280]   and private equity space I could get to know.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.520]   But I haven't reached out.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.240]   I haven't asked any questions.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.240]   I haven't asked for any help.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.000]   But I'm sure if I did, someone is going to reach out and say, "Hey, I'd like to introduce
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.320]   you to XYZ.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.760]   Hey, I have this fund.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.760]   It's open.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.880]   We're raising money.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.520]   Would you be interested in investing in it?"
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.880]   Or "Hey, we're looking at this private company.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.160]   I'd like for you to take a look and maybe you'd want to co-invest and talk about it."
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.380]   So if you really want something or you're really interested in something, go take a
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.720]   look in your own backyard, your own Rolodex, and see who is in that space you could talk
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.720]   to.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.720]   I think you'll be surprised.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.720]   All right, everybody.
