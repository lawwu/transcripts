[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   I think that some people are deliberately trying to completely clear the cultural landscape
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.200]   of our past in order to say there's nothing good, nothing you can hold on to, no one you
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.600]   should revere, you've got no heroes, the whole thing comes down, who's left standing?
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.000]   Oh, we've also got this idea from the 20th century still about Marxism.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.160]   And no, no, you will not have the entire landscape deracinated and then the worst ideas tried
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.320]   again.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.680]   The following is a conversation with Douglas Murray, author of The Madness of Crowds, Gender,
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.440]   Race and Identity, and his most recent book, The War in the West, How to Prevail in the
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.840]   Age of Unreason.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.200]   He's a brilliant, fearless, and often controversial thinker who points out and pushes back against
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.840]   what he sees as the madness of our modern world.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.400]   I should note that the use of the word Marxism and the West in this conversation refers primarily
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.600]   to cultural Marxism and the cultural values of Western civilization, respectively.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.040]   This is in contrast to my previous conversation with Richard Wolff, where we focused on Marxism
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.960]   as primarily a critique of capitalism and thus looking at it through the lens of economics
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.720]   and not culture.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.840]   Nevertheless, these two episodes stand opposite of each other with very different perspectives
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.560]   on how we build a flourishing civilization together.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.160]   I leave it to you, the listener, to think and to decide which is the better way.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.080]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.560]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.040]   And now, dear friends, here's Douglas Murray.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.360]   You recently wrote the book titled The War on the West, which in part says that the values,
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.480]   ideas, and history of Western civilization are under attack.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.240]   So let's start with the basics.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.160]   Historically and today, what are the ideas that represent Western civilization?
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.920]   The good, the bad, the ugly.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.520]   - I actually don't get stuck on definitions precisely because, as you know, once you get
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.400]   stuck on definitions, there's a possibility you'll never get off them.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   - Yes.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.800]   - I'd say a few things.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   Firstly, obviously, the Western tradition is a specific tradition, a specific tradition
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.520]   of ideas, culture, well-known to be perhaps easily defined by the combination of Athens
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:37.200]   and Jerusalem, the world of the Bible, and the world of ancient Greece and indeed Rome.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.000]   It effectively creates European civilization, which itself spawns the rest of the Western
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.200]   civilizations, America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and others.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.000]   But these are the main countries that we still refer to as the West.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.480]   So there's a specific tradition and all the things that come from it.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.320]   My shorthand cheat on this answer is to say, you know when you're not in it.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.880]   So if you've ever been to Beijing, Shanghai, you know you're not in the West, somewhere
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.940]   else, you know you're not in the West.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.760]   When you're in Tokyo, somewhere extraordinary, but you know you're not in the West.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:26.000]   Obviously there are, let's say, borderline questions like, is Russia in the West?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.840]   Which I sort of leave open as a question.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.840]   Possibly.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.520]   - If you were placed into Moscow blindfolded and you woke up and you couldn't hear the
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.200]   language or maybe you didn't know what the language sounded like, would you guess you
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.920]   were in the West or not?
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.560]   - I think I was somewhere near it.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.560]   - Getting closer.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.280]   - I mean, you know, it's what Tolstoy asks the question, doesn't he, whether it's European.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.520]   And I think the answer to that is not really, although massively influenced by Europe, but
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.520]   and times wanting to reach towards it at times wanting to stay away.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.520]   But a part of the West, possibly, yes.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.680]   But anyway, it's a very specific tradition.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.280]   It's one of a number of major traditions in the world.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.440]   And because it's hard to define doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.480]   - Are there certain characteristics and qualities about the values and the ideas that define
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.480]   it?
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.040]   Is the type of rule, the type of governmental structure?
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   - Yes.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.080]   I mean, the rule of law, property-owning democracies and much more.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.880]   I mean, these are, of course, things that ended up being developed in America and then
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.960]   given back to much of the rest of the West.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.480]   I say there are other perhaps more controversial attributes I would give to the West.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.400]   One is a ravenous interest in the rest of the world, which is not shared, of course,
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.160]   by every other culture.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.940]   The late philosopher George Steiner said he could never get out of his head the haunting
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.880]   fact that the boats only seemed to go out from Europe.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:12.120]   You know, they didn't, the explorers, the scholars, the linguists, the people who wanted
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.760]   to discover other civilizations and indeed even resurrect ancient civilizations and lost
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.760]   civilizations.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.080]   These were scholars that were always coming from the West to discover this elsewhere.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.200]   By contrast, there were never boats coming from Egypt to help the Anglo-Saxons discover
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.560]   the origins of their language and so on.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.400]   So I think there is a sort of ravenous interest in the rest of the world, which can be said
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.320]   to be a Western attribute, although it of course also has, one should immediately preface
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.360]   it, some downsides and many criticisms that can be made of some of the consequences of
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.360]   that interest.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.160]   Because, of course, it's not entirely lacking in self-interest.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.160]   - So it's not just the scholars, it's also-- - The armies.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.240]   - The armies.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.760]   And they're looking to gain access and control over resources elsewhere.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.760]   - Markets.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.200]   - And hence the imperial imperative.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.200]   - Exactly.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.440]   - To conquer, to expand.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.800]   - Although that itself, of course, is a universal thing.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.760]   I mean, no civilization I think that we know of doesn't try to gain ground from its neighbors
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.320]   where it can.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.720]   The Western ability to go further, faster, certainly gave an advantage in that regard.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.600]   - Do some civilizations get a bit more excited by that kind of idea than others?
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   - Possible.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   It's possible.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:37.600]   I mean, you could say it's the Western civilization because the technological innovation was more
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   efficient at doing that kind of thing.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.400]   - But maybe it wanted it more, too.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.840]   - Well, the Ottomans wanted it an awful lot and did terribly well for many centuries.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.360]   One shouldn't forget that.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.360]   As did others.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.960]   I'd also say, by the way, and again, it's a very broad one, but it's worth throwing
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:05.200]   out that I think self-criticism is an important attribute of the Western mind, one that, as
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.040]   you know, is not common everywhere.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:14.400]   Not all societies allow even their most vociferous critics to become rich.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.000]   - Criticism is a negative-sounding word.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.800]   It could be self-introspection, self-analysis, self-reflection.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.640]   - And it can be what you need.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.320]   In the Western system, I'd argue that one of the advantages of the system of representative
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:35.200]   governance is that where there are problems in the system, you can attempt to sort them
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.680]   out by peaceable means.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.160]   We listen to arguments, most famously in America in the late 20th century.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.680]   The Civil Rights Movement achieved its aims by force of moral argument and persuaded the
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.120]   rest of the country that it had been wrong.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.040]   It's not common in every society, by any means.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:02.440]   So I think there are certain attributes of the Western mind that you could say are not
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.680]   entirely unique, but they are not as commonplace as well.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:14.720]   - What about the emergence in hierarchies of asymmetry of power, most visible, most
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.280]   drastic in the form of slavery, for example?
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.840]   - Well, I mean, everyone in the world is slavery, so I don't regard it as being a Western...
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.280]   a unique Western sin.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.920]   It's rather hard to think of a civilization in history that didn't have slavery of some
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.920]   kind.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.840]   One of the oddities of the Western ignorance of our day is that people seem to imagine
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.040]   that our societies in the West were the only ones who ever engaged in any vices.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.560]   Alas, this isn't true.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:45.680]   It's a sort of Rousseauian mistake, or at least one that's blossomed since Rousseau,
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.980]   that everybody else in the world was born into sort of Edenic innocence, and only we
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:56.280]   in the West had this sort of evil in us that caused us to do bad things to other people.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.400]   Slavery was engaged in by everyone in the ancient world, of course, and through most
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.720]   of the modern world as well.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.960]   Of course, there are 40 million slaves in the world today, so it's clearly not something
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.040]   that the species as a whole has a problem with.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.200]   That's more slaves, of course, than there were in the 19th century.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.440]   And I'd say on top of that that the interesting thing about the Western mind as regards to
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.960]   slavery is that we were the civilization that did away with it.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:32.520]   And by the way, the founding fathers of America who today are lambasted routinely for being
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:41.120]   acquiescent in the slave trade, engaging in it, owning slaves, people almost don't even
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:47.240]   bother now to recognize the facts that Thomas Jefferson, George Washington all wanted to
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.520]   see this trade done away with, couldn't hold the country together at the origins if they'd
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.760]   have made such an effort, and believed and hoped that it would be something that would
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.860]   be dealt with after their time.
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:05.160]   So the founding ideas had within them the notion that we should as a people get rid
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.160]   of this.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:12.480]   The opening lines of the Declaration of Independence set up the conditions under which slavery
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.680]   will be impossible.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.840]   All men are created equal.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:22.800]   Once you've put that, that's a time bomb under the whole concept of slavery.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   - That's ticking away.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.800]   Okay.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.460]   - And sure enough, it detonated in the next century.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:34.720]   - If we just step back and look at the human species, what does slavery teach you about
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.440]   human nature?
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:44.520]   The fact that slavery has appeared as a function of society throughout human history?
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.140]   - There are two possibilities.
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:55.060]   One is it's what people think they can do when God's not watching.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:00.480]   Another is it's what they can do if they think that God allows it.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.440]   - Really, really well put.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:10.320]   And the fact that they want to do this kind of subjugation, what does that mean?
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.840]   - Well, I mean, it's pretty straightforward in a way.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.120]   There are people who get to work for free.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.360]   - It's economic in nature in some sense.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.360]   - Yes.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.880]   But in order to do it, I mean, almost always there are some examples in the ancient world
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.480]   where this wasn't the case, but almost always it had to be a subjugated people or people
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.680]   regarded as different.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.000]   One of the things actually I've tried to sort of inject into the discussion through this
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.200]   book among other things is a recognition that there were very major questions still going
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.800]   on in the 18th and early 19th century that were unresolved, which were one of the reasons
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:53.720]   why slavery was not as morally repugnant to people then as it is to us now.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.160]   And that's the question of polygenesis and monogenesis.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.160]   At the time of Thomas Jefferson, the founding fathers were thinking and working.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:12.960]   They didn't know because nobody knew whether the human races were related or not.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:18.840]   There were arguments, the monogenesis argument that we were all indeed from the same racial
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.840]   stock.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.800]   Polygenesis argument was that we weren't.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:29.480]   Black Africans, Ethiopians, they're often referred to at the time because they provided
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.400]   some of the first slaves, were different from white Europeans, simply not related in any
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.720]   way.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.400]   And that makes it easier, of course.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.280]   That makes it easier to enslave people if you think they're not your brother.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.280]   Am I my brother's keeper?
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.600]   No, he's not your brother.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:55.160]   And it was a very troubling argument in the 18th and 19th century also because there was
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.160]   a biblical question.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:02.640]   It threw up a theological question, which was, I mean, people were literally debating
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.220]   this at the time.
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.060]   Was there also a black Adam and Eve?
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:14.320]   Was there an Indian Adam and Eve, a Native American Adam and Eve?
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.520]   This was a serious theological debate because they didn't know the answer.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.000]   People say that Darwin solved this.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.400]   It wasn't just Darwin, of course, but by the late 19th century, the argument that we
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:38.120]   were not all related as human beings had suffered so many blows that you had to really be very,
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.500]   very ignorant, deliberately, willfully ignorant to ignore it by then.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.260]   So it no longer was, after Darwin, a theological question.
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.880]   It became a moral question.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.480]   It was already a moral question, but it clarified.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.480]   Darwin clarifies it definitely.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.040]   And then you're in this, as I say, you're in this situation of you're not subjugating
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.920]   some other people, you're subjugating your own kin.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:03.560]   And that becomes morally unsustainable.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:15.920]   - So given that slavery in America is part of its history, how do we incorporate into
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:26.200]   the calculus of policy today, social discourse, what we learn in school?
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.560]   We can look at slavery in America.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:36.240]   We can look at maybe more recent things like in Europe, the other atrocities, the Holocaust.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.240]   How do we incorporate that in terms of how we create policy, how we treat each other,
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.280]   all those kinds of things?
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:49.940]   What is the calculus of integrating the atrocities, the injustices of the past into the way we
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:50.940]   are today?
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:56.720]   - That's a very complex question because it's a moral question at this point, and a moral
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.440]   question long after the fact.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.360]   I say at one point in the war in the West that the argument, for instance, on reparations
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.160]   now that goes on, and it's not a fringe argument anymore.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.080]   Some people say, "Oh, you're pulling up this fringe argument."
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.080]   It really isn't.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.360]   I think every contender for the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 2020 was
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:24.280]   willing to talk about the possibility of reparations, some very eager that this country, America,
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:30.600]   goes through that entirely self-destructive exercise.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.400]   I say that there's a lot of problems with this, but if I could refine it down to one
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.800]   thing, I'd say this.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.360]   It's no longer about a wealth transfer from one group of people who did something wrong
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.560]   to another group of people who were wronged.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.640]   It would have been that, could have been that 200 years ago.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.520]   Today it's not even the descendants of people who did something wrong giving money to people
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.800]   who were the descendants of people who were wronged.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.400]   It's a wealth transfer from people who look like people who did a wrong thing in the past
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.160]   to another group of people who resemble people who were wronged.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.760]   That's impossible to do.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.200]   I'm completely clear about this.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:16.840]   There is no way in which you could organize such a wealth transfer on moral or practical
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.840]   reasons.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:23.080]   America is filled with people who have the same skin color as us, for instance, who have
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:28.720]   no connection to the slave trade and should not be made to pay money to people who have
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.800]   some connection.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:36.480]   Then the country is also filled with ethnic minorities who have come after slavery who
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:43.360]   would not be due for any reimbursement as it were.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.040]   The problem with this is though is that there are, I'm perfectly open to the possibility
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:55.400]   that there are residual inequities that exist in American life and that the consequences
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:01.560]   of slavery could be one of the factors that result from this.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:08.000]   The thing is I don't think it's a single issue answer.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.600]   I think it's a multidimensional issue.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:16.320]   Something like black underachievement in America is obviously a multidimensional issue.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:22.520]   Much of the left and others wish to say it's not, it's only about racism.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:28.640]   They can't answer why Asians who've arrived more recently don't, for instance, get held
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:35.160]   down by white supremacy, but actually, I say white supremacy in quotes obviously, but don't
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.920]   get held back by it, but actually flourish to the extent that Asian Americans have higher
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:49.720]   household earnings and higher household mean equity than, home equity and so on, than white
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.440]   Americans.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:58.040]   I don't think that on the merits the evidence is there that racism is the explanation for
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:03.680]   black ongoing, black underachievement in some sections of the black community in America.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.920]   It's obviously a part of it.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:12.800]   Could you say that even those things like fatherlessness and similar family breakdown
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.840]   issues are a long-term consequence of it?
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:25.160]   Possibly, but it's being awfully generous to people's ability to make bad decisions.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.720]   For instance, how many generations after the Holocaust would you allow people to claim
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:36.120]   that everything that went wrong in the Jewish community was as a result of the Holocaust?
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.120]   Is there some kind of term limit on this?
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.880]   I would have thought so.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.520]   I think most people probably think that's over.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:51.160]   I think the details matter there, but it's very difficult.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.760]   You're in deep waters here.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:59.320]   I enjoy swimming out in the ocean, so although I'm terrified of what's lurking underneath
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.320]   in the darkness.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.320]   You're right.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.360]   You're right to be.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.400]   Okay.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.120]   It's really complicated calculus with the Holocaust and with slavery.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:20.280]   The argument in America is that there's deep institutional racism against African Americans
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:26.080]   that's rooted in slavery.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:33.280]   However that calculus turns out, that calculation, it still persists in the culture, in the institutions,
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:39.640]   in the allocation of resources, in the way that we communicate in subtle ways, in major
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.040]   ways, all that kind of stuff.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:48.040]   How is it possible to win or lose that argument of how much institutional racism there is
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.920]   that's rooted in slavery?
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.920]   Is it a winnable-
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.280]   It's an unquantifiable argument.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.000]   I'd like to apply some shortcuts to some of this.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   The following.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:09.240]   Are, for instance, all, let's take the EVV1 that's most often cited.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.440]   If a white person is walking down a street in America and they see a group of young black
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.480]   men coming towards them and it's late at night and they cross the road, is it because of
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.440]   slavery?
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.840]   Is it because of institutional racism?
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.160]   No.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:36.120]   It's because they've made a calculus based not entirely on unfounded beliefs that given
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:41.600]   crime rates, it's possible that this group of people might be a group of people they
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.920]   don't want to meet late at night.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:50.360]   It's an ugly fact, but crime statistics in American cities, African American cities bear
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.520]   out.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.240]   It's not an entirely unreasonable one.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.540]   It's not reasonable every time, obviously, obviously.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.120]   But is it attributable to slavery?
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.760]   It's a stretch.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:14.640]   If you're in a city like Chicago where the homicide rates shot up in the last two years,
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:21.640]   albeit again, as always has to be remembered, mainly black on black, gun violence and knife
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.640]   violence.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:29.400]   Nevertheless, if you're in a city like Chicago and you make that calculus I've just suggested,
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.840]   the cliched one, the street late at night, there are other factors other than a memory
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.800]   of slavery that kick in.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:44.400]   I'm afraid it's something which people don't want to particularly acknowledge in America
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.720]   for obvious reasons, because it's the ugliest damn debate in the world.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.760]   I was actually just writing in my column in the New York Post today about a very interesting
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:58.720]   case that's sort of similar, which is the question of obesity in the US.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:04.080]   As you know, America's the most overweight country in the world.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:09.760]   America has I think 40% of the population is obese in medical ways.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.480]   The nearest next country is a long way down.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.320]   That's New Zealand at 30% of the population.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.360]   So America's a long way ahead.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:23.520]   Why during the coronavirus era when we know that obesity is the one clearest factor that's
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.720]   likely to lead to your hospitalization if you also get the virus, why did almost no
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.720]   public health information in America focus on obesity?
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:38.440]   80% of the people who ended up hospitalized in America with coronavirus were obese.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.780]   We locked the schools when there was no evidence that the coronavirus was deadly for children.
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:49.440]   We all wore cloth masks when there was very little evidence that this was much use in
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.280]   stopping the spread of the virus.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.800]   We had massive evidence about obesity being a problem and we never addressed it.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.800]   Why?
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.040]   Is it just because we worried about fat people?
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.760]   No, it's actually because about fat shaming as it were.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.360]   No, it's also because to a great extent it's a racial issue in America as well.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:10.360]   Actually, I quoted this new publication from the University of Chicago as it happens, which
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.480]   makes that claim explicit.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.620]   It says the reasons why people have views that are negative about obesity is because
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.740]   of racism and slavery.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.580]   This is what everything is drawn back to in America.
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:25.920]   Anything you want to stop, you say it's because of racism, it's because of slavery.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:33.400]   How about it's actually because you mind the hospitals getting clogged up, you mind people
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:39.160]   dying, you mind ethnic minorities disproportionately dying, and you'd like to say something about
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.160]   it.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:46.640]   Once again, as in everything in America, it's cut off by some poorly educated academic saying
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.760]   it's about slavery.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.840]   This requires a kind of form of brain surgery to perform it on a society, probably one that's
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.320]   not possible without killing the patient.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:05.320]   It's being done by people who are wearing mittens.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:11.880]   I'm sure that there's a few folks listening to this that are rolling their eyes and saying,
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:20.080]   "Here we go again, two white guys talking about the lack of institutional racism in
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.440]   America."
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.800]   First of all, what would you like to tell them?
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:33.240]   Our African American friends who are looking at this, and I've gotten a chance to talk
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.920]   to a bunch of them on Clubhouse recently.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.160]   Clubhouse is this social app.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.160]   - Yeah, yeah, I know.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.160]   - And I really enjoy it.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.160]   - It's an absolute zoo of an app as far as I can see.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:46.600]   - I personally love it because you get to talk to, as somebody who's an introvert and
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:52.280]   doesn't socialize much, I enjoy talking to people from all walks of life.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:57.320]   So it gave me a chance to, first of all, practice Russian and Ukrainian, so I get the chance
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.320]   to do that.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.840]   Then you get a chance to talk about Israel and Palestine with people who are from that
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.840]   part of the world.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:12.300]   And you get to hear raw emotion of people from the ground, where they start screaming,
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:17.680]   they start crying, they start being calm and collected and thoughtful.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:25.080]   This is as if you walked into a bar with custom-picked regular folks, in quotes, regular folks.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:32.760]   Just people that have, quote unquote, lived experiences, real pain, real hope, real emotions,
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:38.360]   biases, and you get to listen to them go at it.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:43.720]   Because it's an audio app, you're not allowed to start getting into a physical fist fight.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.400]   So even though it really sounds like people want it--
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.680]   - It sounds like it's happening, yeah.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.200]   - Yeah, and so you get to really listen to that feeling.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:55.640]   And for example, it allows a white guy like me, from another part of the world, coming
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:03.480]   from the former Soviet Union, to go into a room with a few hundred African Americans
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.860]   screaming about Joe Rogan using the N-word.
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.280]   And I get to really listen.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.360]   There's very different perspectives on that in the African American community, and it's
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.680]   fascinating to listen.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:20.480]   So I don't get access to that by excellent books and articles written and so on.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.520]   You get that real raw emotion.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.680]   And I'm just saying, there's a few of those folks listening to this with that real raw
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:34.080]   emotion, and one argument they say is, "You, Douglas Murray, and you, Lex Freeman, don't
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:38.920]   have the right to talk about race and racism in America.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.720]   It is our struggle.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:47.560]   You are from a privileged class of people that don't know what it's like to be a black
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.280]   man or woman in America walking down the street."
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.080]   Can you steelman that case?
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.720]   - First of all, fuck that.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.560]   - I think we need to define steelmanning.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.360]   Can you at least try it?
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.920]   - I know what steelmanning is.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.600]   I really resent that form of argumentation.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.600]   I really resent it.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.800]   I have the right to talk about whatever the hell I want, and no one's gonna stop me or
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.240]   try to intimidate me or tell me that I can't simply because of my skin color.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.680]   And I think that if I said to somebody else the other way around, it would be equally
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.680]   reprehensible.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.320]   If I said, "Shut up, you have no right to criticize anything that Douglas Murray says
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.960]   because you've not got my skin color."
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:36.520]   Okay, it's not an exact comparison, but seriously, is that a reasonable form of argument?
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.160]   You haven't been through everything I've been through in my life, therefore you can't comment.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.160]   No.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.720]   In that case, nobody can talk about anything.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.560]   We might as well pack up, go home, and isolate ourselves.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:51.520]   - Strong words, but can you try to steelman the case, not in this particular situation,
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:59.000]   but there's people that have lived through something that can comment in a very specific
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   way.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.400]   Like for example, Holocaust survivors.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:09.620]   There is a sense in which maybe a basic sense of civility when a Holocaust survivor is speaking
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:16.680]   about their experience of the Holocaust, then an intellectual from a very different part
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:24.600]   of the world is simply writing about nuanced geopolitics of World War II, just should not
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.880]   interrupt the Holocaust survivor.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.880]   - We physically interrupt them if they're telling their story.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:36.920]   - Is it logic and reason that the experience of the Holocaust survivor somehow fundamentally
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:42.480]   has a deeper understanding of the humanity and the injustice of the-
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:47.600]   - First of all, again, we're in even deeper waters now, but in terms of wanting to listen
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:56.480]   to another person who has experienced something, yes, yes, but not endlessly, not endlessly.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:02.240]   I mean, there are people who've written about the Holocaust who didn't experience the Holocaust
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:07.840]   and have written about it better than people who did.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.640]   This idea that the lived experience, to use this terrible modern jargon, as if there's
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:19.200]   another type, this idea that the lived experience has to triumph over everything else is not
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.760]   always correct.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.820]   It can be correct in some circumstances.
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.680]   If you are sitting in a room with a Holocaust survivor and somebody who'd never heard about
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:33.000]   the Holocaust and wanted to kind of shoot out their views on it, yeah, one of those
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.400]   people should be heard more than the other, obviously, obviously.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.920]   If there's somebody who's experienced racism firsthand and there's somebody else who has
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:46.760]   never experienced it, then obviously you'd want to hear from the person who has experienced
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.960]   it firsthand, if that is the discussion underway.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:57.120]   I don't think that it's the case that that is endlessly the case.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:03.040]   I'm also highly reluctant to concede that there are groups of people who, by dint of
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.000]   their skin color or anything else, get to dominate the microphone.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.720]   Now, of course, we're literally both speaking into microphones at the moment, so there's
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.240]   an irony to this, but let's skate over the irony.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.640]   What I mean is people saying, "You don't have the right to speak.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.400]   I have the right to take the microphone from you and speak because I know best."
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.600]   Fine.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:31.520]   If you know best, we'll argue it out and someone will win, long or short term.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:41.800]   But the almost aggressive tone in which this is now leveled, I don't like the sound of.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:46.480]   Nobody's experience is completely understandable by another human being.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.580]   Nobody's.
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:52.720]   And what many people are asking us to do at the moment, us collectively is, to fall for
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.720]   that thing.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:58.020]   I think it was Camille Foster who said it first, but I've adopted it in recent years,
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:04.160]   is to say, "You must spend an inordinate amount of your life trying to understand me personally,
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.040]   my lived experience, everything about me.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.440]   You should dedicate your life to trying to do that.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.760]   Simultaneously, you'll never understand me."
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.600]   This is not an attractive invitation.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.800]   This is an unwinnable game.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:31.520]   So if somebody has a legitimate and important point to make, they should make it and they'll
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.960]   win through whatever their character is, whatever their race.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.160]   And by the way, there are plenty of white people who experience racism as well.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:42.460]   There are plenty of white people who do and have done, and increasingly so, which is one
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.220]   of the things I write about in The War in the West.
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:51.160]   I would argue that today in America, the only group who are actually allowed to be consistently,
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.040]   vilely racist against the white people.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:32:00.540]   If you say disgusting things about black people in America in 2022, you will be over.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.080]   You will be over.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:07.280]   If you decide to talk about people's white tears, their white female tears, their white
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:12.560]   guilt, their white privilege, their white rage, and all these other pseudo-pathologizing
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.940]   terms, you'll be just fine.
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.200]   You could be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.280]   You could lecture at Yale University.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.280]   Absolutely fine.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.880]   And the white people have to suck that up as if that's fine because there was racism
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.480]   in another direction in the past.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.960]   So white people can have racism as well.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.900]   Does that mean that I think that I have a right or other white people have a right to
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:37.400]   dominate the discourse by talking about their feelings of having been victims of racism?
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.800]   No, not particularly, because what does that get us?
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.640]   It gets us into an endless cycle of competitive victimhood.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.920]   Am I saying that white people who've experienced violence have experienced historically anything
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.480]   like the violence that was perpetrated against black people in America historically?
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.480]   Obviously not.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:00.760]   But what kind of competition do we want to enter here?
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.920]   And this is very, very important terrain now in America because there's one other thing
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:12.000]   I have to throw in there, which is how do you work out the sincerity of the claim?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   How do you work out the sincerity of the claim being made?
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:22.520]   At one point in this latest book, I referred to a very useful bit in Nietzsche on the genealogy
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:28.080]   of morals, where, as you know, Nietzsche always has to be treated carefully.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:34.520]   When people say, "I love Nietzsche," you have to say, "Which bits?
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.920]   What exactly do you love about him?"
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:44.820]   But a lot can be learned from the answer.
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:49.300]   But there are moments in genealogy of morals that were very useful for this book.
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:53.480]   One of them was the moment when Nietzsche uses a phrase that I've now stolen from myself,
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:34:02.800]   or appropriated, you might say, where he refers to people who tear at wounds long since closed
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:07.600]   and then cry about the pain they feel.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:14.000]   Now how do you know whether the pain is real?
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   How do you know?
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.240]   I'm not saying you can never know, but it's hard.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.140]   So when somebody says, "I feel that my life hasn't gone that well, and it's because of
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:29.920]   something that was done to my ancestors 200 years ago," maybe they do feel that.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.180]   Maybe they're right to feel that.
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.180]   Maybe they're making it up.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:37.560]   Maybe they're using it as their reason for failure in life.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.020]   Maybe they're using it as their reason to not even try.
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.940]   Maybe they're using it as their reason to smoke weed all day.
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.380]   I don't know.
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.380]   And who does know?
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.040]   How can you work that out?
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:54.420]   And that's why I come back to this thing of, who are we to constantly judge in this society
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:35:04.000]   other people who we don't know and attribute motives to them based on racial or other characteristics?
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:12.240]   And as you write in this part, I like your cultural appropriation of Nietzsche, and at
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.940]   the same time canceling Nietzsche in the same set of sentences.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.840]   But you write in this part about evil.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.120]   No, I didn't cancel Nietzsche.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.120]   Well.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.120]   I can't cancel Nietzsche.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.000]   I was saying, "Treat him carefully."
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Treat him carefully, fair enough.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.320]   But you can judge a man's character by which parts of Nietzsche he quotes.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.320]   Fair enough.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:42.600]   I think when you meet people who do Man and Superman a bit too much.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:47.040]   Now you're pulling in even deeper water, referencing Hitler here.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   Okay.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.920]   So you write in this part of the book about evil.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:57.440]   Quote, "What is it that drives evil?
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:02.200]   Many things without doubt, but one of them is identified by several of the great philosophers
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.520]   is resentment.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:10.720]   That sentiment is one of the greatest drivers for people who want to destroy," colon, "blaming
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.280]   someone else for having something you believe you deserve more."
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:20.480]   And you're saying this kind of resentment, we don't know as it surfaces whether it's
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:29.600]   genuine or if it's used to sort of play games of power to evil ends.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.360]   Can you speak to this?
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:38.160]   Because it's such a fascinating idea that one of the biggest drivers of evil in the
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.520]   world is resentment.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:47.560]   Because if you look at, boy, if you look at human history, if you look at Hitler, so much
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.440]   of the propaganda, so much of the narrative was about resentment.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:55.320]   So is that surface or is it level or is that deep?
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.320]   The resentment that drives evil.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.680]   It can be any of the above.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.560]   First of all, preface it, everybody has resentment.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:09.720]   I use the term, resentment is thought very similar to resentment, less sick with resentment.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:14.640]   So we don't sound too pretentious.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:22.000]   The, let me give you a quick example of somebody in our own day who has a form of resentment,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.960]   Vladimir Putin.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.480]   Did you see Navalny's documentary, Putin's Palace?
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.840]   Yes.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.960]   You remember the stuff about Putin as a young KGB officer in Germany?
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.880]   Remember the stuff about Putin and his first wife's resentment of one of his KGB colleagues
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:42.840]   who had an apartment that was a few meters bigger than the Putin's apartment?
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.840]   It's very interesting.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:50.280]   And by the way, I'm not saying that Vladimir Putin became the man he has become and invaded
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.440]   Ukraine because he didn't have an apartment he liked in Berlin or Munich or wherever he
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.440]   was.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.440]   It's a distinct possibility.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:05.760]   My point is that resentment is a factor in all human lives and we all feel it in our
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:11.180]   lives and it's something that has to be struggled against.
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:15.760]   Resentment is in political terms can be a deadly, I mean, it's an incredibly deep thing
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.760]   to draw upon.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.360]   I mean, you mentioned Hitler.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:24.920]   Obviously one of the things that Hitler played on was resentment, obviously.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.040]   Almost every revolution does.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.240]   I mean the French revolutionaries did as well and not without cause.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:38.400]   There's a good reason to feel that Versailles was not listening to Paris in the 1780s and
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:45.160]   feel resentment for Marie Antoinette in her palace within the palace, ignoring the bread
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:49.240]   shortages in Paris.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:55.480]   So resentment is a very understandable thing and sometimes it's justifiable and it's also
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:59.120]   deadly to the person as it is to the society.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.040]   It's an incredibly deep, deep sentiment.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:06.080]   Somebody else has got something that you should have.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:11.240]   And the problem about it is that it has the potential to be endless.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.320]   You can do it your whole life.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:18.760]   And one of the ways I've sort of found myself explaining this to people is to say it's also
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.400]   important to recognize that resentment is something that can cross absolutely every
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.400]   boundary.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:30.600]   So for instance, it crosses all racial boundaries, obviously, as I goes out saying.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:35.760]   What's more interesting is it crosses all class boundaries and socioeconomic boundaries.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:42.240]   And if I was to sort of simplify this thought, I would say, I guess that you and I and everybody
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:53.400]   watching knows or has known somebody in their lives who has almost nothing in worldly terms
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:40:01.560]   and is a generous person, a kindly person, a giving person, a happy person, even a cheerful
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.520]   person.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:08.640]   And I think we probably have also, or many of us would have met people who seem to have
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:14.960]   everything and who are filled with resentment, filled with resentment.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.440]   Somebody else has held them back from something.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.720]   Their sister once did something.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.720]   She shouldn't.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.720]   She got this.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.720]   I should have got that.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.600]   And on and on and on.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.520]   It's a human trait.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:29.960]   And one of the things that suggests to me is that we therefore have a choice in our
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.960]   lives about this.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.880]   This is something which we can do something about, not limitlessly.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:40.440]   But for instance, I mean, there are very good reasons that some people in their lives might
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.680]   feel resentment.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:48.040]   Let's say you're involved in a car crash and a friend fell asleep at the wheel and that's
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.840]   why you are spending the rest of your life in a wheelchair.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:57.000]   That's a pertinent example of this in American politics at the moment.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.480]   You would be justified in feeling resentment.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:06.560]   And at some point you have to make a decision which is, am I going to be that person or
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.560]   a different person?
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:12.480]   - But even in that case, you're saying at the individual level and at societal level
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.000]   is destructive to the mind.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.200]   Even when you're quote unquote justified.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.520]   - It rots you.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:27.240]   It rots you because the best you can do is to eke out your days unfulfilled.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.640]   - So the antidote, as you describe, is gratitude.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.840]   - Yes.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.280]   - Gratitude is the antidote to evil in a sense.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.720]   Gratitude at the individual level and at the societal level.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.840]   - Gratitude is certainly the answer to resentment.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:47.480]   I quote in the War on the West, when I read it the first time a few years ago, it's absolutely
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:52.600]   flawed by the Brothers Karamazov.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:57.360]   Not everything in it, by the way, and I won't get into it, but I have some very big structural
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.040]   criticisms of the novel.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.520]   - Now you're just sweet talking to me because I'm a Dostoevsky fan, but I appreciate this.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.520]   - Okay.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:09.480]   Well, we could get into what I see as the structural flaws in the Brothers Karamazov,
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.480]   but anyway.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.280]   - Now I'm offended and triggered.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:19.120]   - Yeah, no, I mean this is coming out of Macbeth and saying, "I didn't think it was much good."
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.600]   - Yeah, they're structural flaws.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:26.160]   - Yeah, I thought the ending stank and the middle wasn't very good.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:30.600]   When I read that novel, I was floored by a couple of things.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:34.960]   One is, of course, the moment where we realize the devil appears.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:40.720]   The moment that Ivan says to his brother, "You know he visits me," and you realize that
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:46.920]   he's talking about the devil, the whole novel goes into this totally different space.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.840]   It's even more than you've already realized the novel's about.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:57.840]   And then when the conversation occurs between Ivan and the devil, I think he describes him
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:05.560]   as dressed in the French style of the early part of the 19th century.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:11.520]   Very strange that the devil would be dressed like that, but sort of...
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:16.680]   And if you remember, he's sort of crossed legs and rather a vain figure.
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:23.040]   But the devil mentions in passing to Ivan that, he says, "I don't know why gratitude
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:30.480]   is not an instinct that's being given to me."
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:34.360]   And you're not allowed, this is not...
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:38.320]   Given the role of being the devil, this is not one of the things.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:42.000]   - And of course, only a genius of Dostoevsky's stature could...
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.360]   I mean, a lesser genius would have made a whole novel out of that insight.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.600]   Only Dostoevsky can just throw it away, because there's such an abundance of riches that he
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.560]   still has to get through.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.440]   The structural problems aside.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:06.200]   - The passive aggressive, the microaggression in this conversation is palpable.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.520]   - Little knife fight.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:12.280]   But the reason I mention this is because, of course, when I saw it, I thought, this
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:17.840]   is such a brilliant insight by Dostoevsky, because why would gratitude not be a sentiment
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.000]   the devil was capable of?
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.040]   And the answer is, of course, that if the devil was capable of gratitude, he wouldn't
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.040]   be the devil.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.840]   He'd be somebody else.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.560]   He has to be incapable of gratitude.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:36.480]   - Do you think, for Dostoevsky, that was as strong of an insight as it is for you?
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:43.800]   Because I think that's a really powerful idea, that with gratitude, you don't get the resentment
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.680]   that rots you from the core.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:52.280]   - Yes, I think it was one of the just endless things that he saw in us.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:57.920]   And the way I put it is that, I also think of it in terms of the era of deconstruction,
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.440]   which is one of the things I'd like us to call the era that's now ending.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:08.600]   The era of deconstruction was the era that started, let's say, from the '60s onwards,
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:13.840]   and was originally an academic game that then spilled out into the wider culture, which
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:17.080]   was, let's take everything apart.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.080]   Let's pull it all apart.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:21.000]   There are lots of problems with it.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.160]   One is it's quite boring.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:28.080]   You don't get an awful lot from it.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:32.560]   You also have the problem of what children find when they try to do this with bicycles,
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:38.480]   which is they can take it apart quite easily, but they can't put it back together.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:46.560]   And the era of taking things apart as a game is one we've lived through, and it's been
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.760]   highly destructive.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.440]   But you can do it for quite a long time.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:56.480]   I'm going to look at this society, and I'm going to take it apart by showing systemic
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.480]   problems.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.720]   I'm going to...
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.440]   At the end of that, what have you got?
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.440]   What have you done?
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.220]   What have you achieved?
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:05.120]   We need to interrogate this.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:09.800]   Okay, interrogate, by all means, ask questions, but interrogate as a deliberate hostility
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.120]   to this.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.760]   I'm going to interrogate this thing and take it apart, and again, at the end of it, what
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.160]   have you got?
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:24.600]   Whether you're interrogating a text or a piece of music or an idea or a society, fine.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.880]   Question, endlessly question.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:35.480]   Interrogate, assumes it's all a criminal in a cell, and it's guilty, and therefore it
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.740]   must be taken apart.
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:41.480]   And that's what we've been doing for decades in the West.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.980]   And that's resentment.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.280]   That's one byproduct of resentment.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:51.160]   You can't build the thing, but you know how to take it apart.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.120]   Is a little bit of resentment good?
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:47:01.120]   So you have, you know, that, I love Tom Waits, and he has a song where, "I like my Tom with
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.120]   a little drop of poison."
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.360]   Is it good to do that?
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.880]   Is it good to have a little bit of poison in your drink?
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:13.120]   Depends what the poison is, and it depends if you know not to have another drink.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:18.480]   It might be the case, you find out, as some alcoholics do, that one was too many and ten
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.260]   is not enough.
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:27.880]   So there's a natural, in this case, this kind of deconstruction is a slippery slope.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.640]   It becomes an addiction, becomes a drug, and you just can't stop.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:35.640]   You'd have to wean yourself off it and try to start creating again.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:41.040]   You'd have to start trying to put things together again.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:47.120]   Something I think might be in the throes of starting as it happens.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:54.080]   - Well, speaking of taking things apart and not putting them together again, the idea
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.320]   of critical race theory.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:04.520]   Can you, to me, explain, so I'm an engineer and have not been actually paying attention
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.880]   much unfortunately to these--
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:11.160]   - None of the people in your field were until it comes along and smacks you in the face.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:21.120]   - I've had that line of thinking from MIT, I said, "Well, surely whatever you folks are
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:26.280]   busy about yelling at each other for is a thing at Harvard and Yale."
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   It's not going to--
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.280]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.400]   People in the STEM subjects thought, "It's not coming for us.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.880]   It can't come to us," and bang.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.440]   - Well, it hasn't quite been a bang.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:40.520]   - Engineering is more safe than others.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:46.200]   So, let's draw a line now between engineering and science.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:53.400]   I think engineering is, I'm sitting in a castle in the tallest tower with my pinky out drinking
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:49:01.440]   my martini saying, "Surely the peasants below with their biology and their humanities will
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.440]   figure it all out."
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.440]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.440]   There's no pinky out.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.560]   I drink vodka and I hang with the peasants.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.560]   Okay, where is this?
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.760]   The metaphor has gone too far.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:16.520]   Can you explain to this engineer what critical race theory is?
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.480]   Is it a term that's definable?
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.480]   Is there a tradition?
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.640]   Is there a history?
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:22.640]   What is good about it?
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.360]   What is bad about it?
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.360]   - It is a tradition.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.360]   It is a history.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.360]   It's a school of thought.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:32.840]   It started in the law roughly in the 1970s in some of the American academy.
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:33.840]   It spilled out.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:37.000]   It always aimed to be an activist philosophy.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.920]   People deny that now, but as I cite in the war in the West, the foundational texts say
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:42.920]   as much.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:48.360]   This is an activist academic study.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.680]   We're not just looking at the law.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.920]   We seek to change the law.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.200]   It's built out into all of the other disciplines.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.880]   I think there's a reason for that, by the way, which is it happened at the time that
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:02.960]   the humanities and others in America were increasingly weak and didn't know what to
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:07.840]   do, and they needed more games to play or new games to play.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.320]   - The psychologists got bored.
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.320]   - Yeah.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.880]   Well, they needed tenure.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.840]   They needed something to do.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:16.840]   It's not an original observation.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.160]   Plenty of people have made this, but Neil Ferguson said this some time ago, for instance,
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:27.640]   that in the last 50 years in American academia, certainly in humanities departments, when
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.600]   somebody dies out who's a great scholar in something, that's just not replaced by somebody
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.400]   of equal stature.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:38.120]   They're replaced by somebody who does theory or critical race theory.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.920]   They're replaced by somebody who does the modern games.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:45.080]   Somebody dies out who's a great historian of, say, I don't know, it's the one that's
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:53.760]   on my mind, Russian history or Russian literature, and they're not replaced by a similar scholar.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:57.760]   - In his observation and in yours, is this a recent development?
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.360]   - It's happened in the last few decades, for sure, and it's sped up.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:05.120]   - Is it because we've gotten to the bottom of some of the biggest questions of history?
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:09.400]   - No, it's because we're willing to forget the big questions.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.120]   - Because it's more fun to, big questions are as fun?
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:16.840]   - Well, no, partly it's, no, I should stress that partly this isn't the reason, but partly
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:21.400]   it's a result of the hyper-specialization in academia.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:31.960]   You know, if you said you'd like to write your dissertation on Hobbes, if you wanted
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:40.240]   to, if you, something central to Kant's thought or Hegel or something, I mean, that's not
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.960]   popular.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:47.200]   What's popular is to take somebody way down the line from that because there's a feeling
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:50.000]   that that's all been done.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.120]   So you take something way, way, way down the line from that that's much less important
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:57.240]   and then you sort of play with that.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:01.080]   And I think most people, anyone who's watching who's been in a philosophy department or anything
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:04.360]   else in recent years will know that tendency.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:06.760]   By the way, there's a very practical consequence of this.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:11.840]   I saw this at the end of my friend Roger Scruton's life when he would occasionally, he didn't
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:18.080]   get tenure at universities, but he would occasionally be flown in even by his enemies to teach courses
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:22.800]   in various universities in basics of philosophy because there was no one in the department
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.920]   able to do it.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:33.600]   He would go in and teach for a semester, you know, Hegel and Kant and Schopenhauer and
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:38.640]   others because there was no one to do it because they were all playing with things way, way,
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.720]   way down the road from this.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:46.300]   So that had already happened and people were searching for new games to play and the critical
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:53.440]   race theory stuff forced its way in partly in the way that all of this that's now known
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:58.000]   as anti-racism does, which is in a sort of bullying tone of saying if you don't follow
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   this.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.480]   It's the same way that all the things that are called studies, I think everything called
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:07.160]   studies in the humanities should be shut down.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.320]   - Because of the activist element.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.840]   - They're all activists.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:16.820]   Gay studies and queer studies, nothing good has ever come from it.
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:17.820]   Nothing good.
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:24.820]   - To push back, is it obvious that activism is a sign of a flaw in a discipline?
[00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:25.820]   So isn't it--
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:27.540]   - It's a sign of the death of the discipline.
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.940]   It's a sign the discipline's over.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:36.580]   - But isn't it a good goal to have for discipline to enact change, positive change in the world?
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:44.320]   - Or is that for politicians to do with the findings of science, not the scientists themselves?
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:49.840]   - Why create an ideology and then set out to find disciplines that are weakly put together
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:53.640]   to try to back up your political ideology?
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:54:00.480]   - So ideology should not be part of science or of the humanities?
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.480]   - No.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.740]   I mean, anyone could do it.
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:11.680]   You could decide to go in and be wildly right-wing about something and only do things that prove
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:18.880]   your right-wing ideas, be fantastically anti-academic, fantastically anti-science.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:25.680]   It's an absurd way to mix up activism and academia.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.000]   And it's absolutely rife.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.920]   And critical race theory is one of the ones that completely polluted the academy.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:37.080]   - Yeah, and there's been dark moments throughout history, both during World War II with both
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:46.080]   communism and Nazism, fascism, that infiltrated science and then corrupted it.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.080]   - Yes.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:50.960]   I mean, for instance, also, let's face it, in science, as in everything else, there are
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.200]   dark, difficult things.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:57.520]   It's much better we know about them, face up to them, and try to find a way socially
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:03.160]   to deal with them, than that you leave them in the hands of some activist who wants to
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:05.360]   do stuff with them.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.360]   - Some of my best friends are activists.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:08.360]   I'm just kidding.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.360]   Okay.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.360]   - Yeah.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.440]   None of my best friends are activists.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.120]   That's how it should be.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:16.040]   - Well, I was kidding because I don't have any friends.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.040]   But okay.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.320]   Now I'm-- - Sure, that's not true.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:22.960]   - I'm trying to gain some pity points.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.960]   Okay.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:27.160]   So to return-- - You have your clubhouse friends.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:30.120]   - Screaming away like deranged maniacs.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:34.480]   No, I'm anti-clubhouse, by the way, because the only time I heard it was that Brett Weinstein
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.120]   one when he did that.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.280]   I don't know if you heard that early in clubhouse.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.680]   I was invited to clubhouse with various people.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:43.200]   He was like, "Oh, this is a really great, civilized way to hang out and talk with interesting
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.200]   people."
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:48.840]   And I downloaded the app, and I got on one night, and because Brett Weinstein said I'm
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:53.720]   doing this conversation, and I listened, and it was the maddest damn discussion I've ever
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:54.720]   heard.
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:59.080]   - Was it something about biology, something about, was it COVID times, all that?
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:06.520]   - At some point, Brett said, "I'm an evolutionary biologist."
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:09.920]   And somebody else started saying, "You're a eugenicist."
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:11.920]   And he said, "No, I'm an evolutionary biologist."
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.120]   And somebody else was like, "That's the same thing."
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:16.520]   And it just went on like that.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:21.720]   And Brett desperately tried to explain that's not the same thing as being a eugenicist,
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:24.160]   and he lost the clubhouse room.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.840]   They thought that was the same thing.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:30.720]   He'd come, it horribly reminded me of a time some years ago when a British newspaper ran
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:36.160]   a sort of, realizing that the only thing you can unite people on in sexual ethics is revulsion
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:40.320]   against pedophilia, ran an anti-pedo campaign.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:46.640]   And shortly after, pediatricians' offices were torched in north of England by a mob
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.920]   who hadn't read the whole sign.
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:55.080]   - Yeah, well, to me, like I said, a little bit of poison is good for the town.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.720]   - Anyhow, sorry, I interrupted you with flattering you with people in clubhouse.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:06.600]   - I have many, I have multiples of friends, yes.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:10.320]   We didn't get to some of the ideas of critical race theory.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:11.880]   What exactly is it?
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:16.120]   I'm actually in part asking this question quite genuinely.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:20.520]   It's an attempt to look at everything among other things through the lens of race, and
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:27.160]   to add race into things where it may not be as a way of adding, I'm trying to give the
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:32.880]   most generous estimation, to add race in as a conversation in a place where it may not
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:37.120]   have been in the conversation.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.720]   - And that means history too?
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.720]   The history of racism?
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.960]   - Oh, sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.560]   All history.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:48.040]   And to look at it through these particular lenses.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:53.360]   I mean, there's a certain, like all these things, there's a certain logic in it, like
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.000]   with feminist studies or something.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.760]   I mean, is there a utility in looking back through undoubtedly male-dominated histories
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:04.120]   and asking where the more silent female voice was?
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:06.240]   Yes, very interesting.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:16.800]   Not endlessly interesting, and can't be put exactly on the same par as, but it has a utility.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:20.360]   - It's that endlessly, sorry to interrupt, that endlessly part that seems to get us into
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:21.360]   trouble a lot.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:22.360]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.560]   Well, because of this thing of where do you stop?
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:32.600]   And that's always, I talked about this in my last book in the Manners of Crowds, it's
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:38.640]   one of the big conundrums in activist movements and particularly in activist academia.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.640]   Where would you stop?
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:46.480]   It's not clear because you've got a job in it, you've got a pension in it, you've got
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:50.720]   your only esteem in society is in keeping this gig going.
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:58.040]   I mean, is there any likelihood, have you ever, there's the old academic joke, isn't
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:01.800]   it, that the end of every conference, the only thing everyone agrees on is that we must
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:05.280]   have another conference like this one?
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:09.760]   So one thing they always agree on, this conference is so great, we must have another one.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.240]   - Well, that's a criticism you could apply to a lot of disciplines.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.240]   - Of course.
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:19.160]   - Civil engineering, bridge building, at a certain point, do we need any more bridges?
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.800]   Can we just fly everywhere?
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:25.600]   - Well, at the very least, you need to keep the bridges up.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:31.040]   - Sure, and they would, critical race theory folks would probably make the same argument,
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.600]   at the very least, we need to keep the racism out.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:37.760]   We have to make sure we don't descend into the racism.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:42.920]   - It assumes all the time that we are living on the cusp of the return of the KKK, which
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:43.920]   is totally wrong.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:48.840]   I mean, it's a massive-- - Well, you say that now until the KKK armies
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:49.920]   march in.
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.580]   We can't always predict the future.
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:58.700]   - We can't always predict the future, and you can always say you should be careful,
[00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:05.420]   but you've also got to be careful of people who've got their timing totally, totally wrong,
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:07.020]   or their estimation of society they're in.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:14.980]   - You mean like most of society before in the 1930s, when Hitler was, I mean, so many
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.380]   people got Hitler wrong.
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.380]   - Sure they did.
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.620]   Most people.
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:28.460]   - Maybe it was nice to have the alarmist thinking there, beware of the man with the mustache.
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.860]   - If only it was that easy.
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.100]   - It's not always about facial hair.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:36.620]   - I always say that, I mean, one-- - It very often is.
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.420]   - These two clean-shaven chaps both say.
[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:45.100]   One of the problems of everybody knowing a little bit about Nazism is that they think
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:50.780]   that they know where evil comes from, and that it comes from like a German with a small
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:57.180]   mustache getting people to goose step, for instance, and that's not correct.
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:03.580]   A much better understanding of it is it can come from all number of directions and keep
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:09.940]   your antennae as good as you can, but once you end up in this society, which I would
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:15.900]   argue certainly parts of America in, where you're always in 1938, that's not healthy
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:22.260]   for a society either, where people are so primed and think they're so well-trained because
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:28.420]   they spent a term in school learning about the Second World War and the Holocaust, think
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:33.060]   they're so well-trained in Hitler spotting that they can do it all the time.
[01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:37.500]   Look at all these phrases we now have in our societies like dog whistle.
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:42.860]   As I always say, if you hear the whistle, you're the dog, but people say that's a dog
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:47.540]   whistle as if they're highly trained anti-Nazis.
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.180]   I mean, there should be some humility in it.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.180]   We should be careful.
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:02:00.220]   We should be wary for sure, and we should also be slightly humble in our inability to
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.220]   spot everything.
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:04.100]   - If not significantly humble.
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:05.140]   Right.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:18.980]   So if we can, there's something funny if not dark about the activity of Hitler spotting,
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:22.540]   if I just may take it aside.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:28.860]   So critical race theory, how much racism, what is racism?
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:31.320]   How much of it is in our world today?
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:38.880]   If we're thinking about this activity of Hitler spotting, how, and trying to steel man the
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:46.300]   case of if not critical race theory, but people who look for racism in our world, how much
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.300]   would you say?
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:50.100]   - Well, it's a good thing to try to define.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:58.120]   I would say that racism is the belief that other people are inferior to you.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.580]   You could see a form of it where you thought people were superior to you.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:06.860]   That could also happen, but more commonly is you see a group of people as being inferior
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:12.860]   to you simply by dint of the fact that they have a different racial background.
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:21.080]   And that's sort of the easiest way to define racism.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:25.300]   As I say, I mean, there are types of racism, mainly anti-Semitism actually, perhaps it's
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:33.580]   the only one, which weirdly relies on a hatred of people who a certain type of person thinks
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.860]   are better than them.
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:39.820]   And that's a particular peculiarity, one of the peculiarities of anti-Semitism.
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:42.860]   - Well, anti-Semitism somehow does both, right?
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:48.020]   - Yes, well, one of the eternal fascinating things about anti-Semitism is it can do, it
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:50.060]   does everything at the same time.
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:52.380]   - It's like a quantum racism.
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.380]   - Yes.
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.020]   - You're both superior and inferior.
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:04:00.100]   - You know that, do you know Vassily Grossman's "Life and Fate"?
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:04.020]   So in the middle of "Life and Fate," which a Persian friend of mine always said was one
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:07.580]   of only two great novels of the 20th century, she was a very harsh literary critic.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:08.980]   - What was the other one?
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:10.940]   - Oh, "The Leopard," obviously.
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:11.940]   - "The Leopard"?
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:14.980]   - "The Leopard," of Giuseppe de Lamperdusa, yeah.
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:17.060]   She's definitely right on that one.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.060]   "Life and Fate" is--
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.060]   - I'm learning so much today, yes.
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:26.100]   - "Life and Fate" is an extraordinary book, mainly about, well, you know Grossman was
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:35.620]   obviously Jewish himself, but he saw almost everything that he could have done in the
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:36.620]   Second World War.
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:42.300]   He saw Stalingrad, he was a journalist, and he wrote firsthand accounts of Stalingrad.
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:47.300]   He was also the first journalist into Treblinka, and his account, which you can read in one
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:51.580]   of the collections of his journalism, his account of walking into Treblinka is just
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:56.420]   one of the most devastating, haunting pieces of journalism or prose you can read.
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:05:00.780]   Anyhow, I mention him because Grossman, in the middle of "Life and Fate," which is about
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:11.860]   a 900-page novel, in the middle of it, which is about the dark axis around Stalingrad,
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:17.020]   he way at one point, amazingly, he sort of goes into the minds of both Hitler and Stalin.
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:24.100]   He says Stalin, in his study, feels his counterpart in Berlin, and he says he feels very close
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.500]   to him at this moment.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.940]   - Wow, around Stalingrad, like leading up to the battle.
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:35.380]   - After Stalingrad, when the Germans are lost, he says he feels the closeness of Hitler.
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:42.060]   But Grossman, in the middle of "Life and Fate," slap bang at the worst hours of the 20th century,
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:47.580]   suddenly dedicates a chapter to antisemitism.
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:51.980]   And antisemitism is something I've always been very interested in, because I've always
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:06:00.020]   had the instinctive utter revulsion of it, and also partly because of having seen bits
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:02.900]   of it in the Middle East and elsewhere.
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:08.060]   But I mention this because Grossman, in the middle of "Life and Fate," takes time out
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:15.140]   and does this three-page description of antisemitism, and it's extraordinary.
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:26.460]   The only thing I can think of that's equally good is Gregor von Redsor, who wrote a luridly
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:33.940]   titled but brilliant set of novellas called "The Confessions of an Antisemite," about
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:37.340]   pre-First World War antisemitism in Eastern and Central Europe.
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:43.940]   Grossman says, in the middle of "Life and Fate," that one of the extraordinary things
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:47.420]   about antisemitism is that it does everything at the same time.
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:52.760]   The Jews get condemned in one place for being rich and in another for being poor, condemned
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:59.460]   in one place for assimilating and in another for not assimilating, for assimilating too
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:05.620]   much and assimilating too little, for being too successful, for not being successful enough.
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:14.460]   So I think it's the only racism that includes within it a detestation, for the real antisemite,
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:20.380]   a detestation of people that the person may perceive to be better than them, correctly
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:21.460]   or otherwise.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:26.660]   - By the way, I'm embarrassed to say I have not read this one of two greatest novels of
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:29.740]   the 20th century, "Life and Fate," "The Zhizni Sedba."
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:33.860]   And just to read off of Wikipedia, "Vasily Grossman, a Ukrainian Jew, became a correspondent
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:37.420]   for the Soviet military paper, Krasna Zvezda.
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:42.380]   Having volunteered and been rejected for military service, he spent a thousand days on the front
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:48.220]   lines, roughly three of the four years of the conflict between the Germans and the Soviets.
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:54.780]   And the main themes covered in," how's it go, "Life and Fate," I keep thinking, "Zhizni
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:59.860]   Sedba," is a theme on Jewish identity and the Holocaust, Grossman's idea of humanity
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:06.180]   and the human goodness, Stalin's distortion of reality and values, and science that goes
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.140]   on in reality of war.
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:10.740]   It's interesting, I need to definitely read it.
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:13.380]   - I think you'll really get a lot from it.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:17.420]   One of the other things, sorry, but one of the other things he does is he has this extraordinary
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:23.660]   ability to talk about the absolute highest levels of the conflict and then zoom in.
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:27.340]   It's rather like the camera work they use in things like "Lord of the Rings," where
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:32.980]   he zooms down and then gets one person in the midst of all this, and you get on that.
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:34.260]   - Or put you in the study, too.
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:39.540]   So I personally have read and reread the William Shires' "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,"
[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:46.060]   who's another journalist who was there, but he does not do it.
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:52.480]   Interestingly enough, given such a large novel, kind of the definitive original work that
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:59.300]   goes to source materials on Hitler, he doesn't touch anti-Semitism really.
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:02.700]   - Big thing to miss out.
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:08.620]   - Well, he just says it very calmly and objectively as he does for most of the work, that this
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:12.380]   was the fact of life.
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.820]   There's a lot of cruelty throughout, but he doesn't get to--
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:20.140]   - Well, one of the things is, of course, he lost the war because of anti-Semitism.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:24.820]   One kind of important way to view it, as Andrew Roberts and other historians say, is that
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:29.740]   in the end, the Nazis lost the war because they were Nazis.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:35.820]   It sounds almost too neat, but it's worth remembering that at the end of the war, when
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:41.460]   the Germans need to be transporting troops and they need to be transporting very basic
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:48.140]   supplies, Eichmann makes sure he gets the trains to transport the Jews right up to the
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.140]   end.
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:51.540]   - Well, that's certainly a dark possibility.
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:58.260]   - Anyhow, but to go back to racism in general, racism in general, apart from anti-Semitism,
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:06.020]   relies on the perception that another group of people, a racial group, other than your
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:08.340]   own are inferior to you.
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:11.380]   That's what I'd say is the easiest shorthand of racism.
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:18.340]   Of course, it's one of the stupidest things that our species is capable of.
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:25.620]   One of the stupidest that you can look at a person and guess them in their entirety,
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:28.140]   in fact, because of their skin color.
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:32.980]   I mean, it's like, what a stupid idea that is, as well as being an evil one.
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:41.940]   But I would say that one of the, I think it's a dangerous thing in our era that there are
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:43.140]   bits of it coming back.
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:48.620]   That's why I say we do need sort of, we need our antennae working.
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:53.340]   We just don't need them to be overactive or underactive.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:11:00.140]   - Now the book is "War in the West," but speaking of racism, racism towards different groups
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:05.460]   based on their skin color, you've said that there's a war on white people in the US.
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:06.740]   Would you say that's the case?
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:13.420]   Would you say that there is significant racism towards white people in the United States?
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:16.620]   - I'd say that white people in the United States are the only people who are told that
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:20.460]   they have hereditary sin.
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.700]   That's a big one just to start with.
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:23.700]   - Based strictly on their skin color.
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:24.700]   - Based on their skin color.
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:31.460]   I mean, I would find it so repugnant if, and I hope everybody would join me in feeling
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:35.980]   this, I would feel it's so repugnant if there were any school of thought in America today
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:46.020]   that had any grasp on the public attention that said that black people were born into
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:49.100]   evil because of something their ancestors had done.
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:52.460]   Like they had the mark of Cain upon them.
[01:11:52.460 --> 01:12:02.060]   I mean, I think it would be such a vicious way to try to demoralize a group of people
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:06.880]   and to tell them that the things they would be able to achieve in their lives are much
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.740]   lessened because they should spend significant portions of their lives trying to atone for
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.680]   something they didn't do.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.580]   - Is there a difference?
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:21.900]   - And the point, the obvious point, left unsaid, but I'll say it.
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.820]   Nobody in the public square says that.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:31.660]   I mean, they're the maniacs of the far fringes, but nobody in the mainstream would dare to
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:36.900]   say that, or I think even think that about any group of people other than white people.
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:42.340]   And does this mean that white people are more disadvantaged than black people?
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:43.340]   No.
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:48.020]   And again, let's not make this a competition, but let's not get into, I just desperately
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:54.140]   urge people not to get into the idea of hereditary sin according to racial background.
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:59.620]   - Is there something to be said about the feature aspect, to sort of play devil's advocate,
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:06.460]   about the asymmetry of sort of accusations towards the majority?
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:07.460]   - Yes, of course.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:09.420]   - Because white-- - It's much easier to attack a majority.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.860]   - It is much easier, but is there something to be said about that being a useful function
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:20.980]   of society that you always attack, that the minority has disproportionate power to attack
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:25.020]   the majority so that you can always keep the majority in check?
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:28.180]   - Well, it's a dangerous game to play, isn't it?
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:30.620]   - I think-- - It's a very dangerous game to play.
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.940]   - That's a good summary of entirety of human civilization.
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:35.900]   - Oh yeah, everything's dangerous.
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:37.740]   But it's a very dangerous game to play that.
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:43.140]   I wrote about this a bit in "The Madness of Crowds" when I was saying to gay rights people,
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:49.460]   the ones that still exist, the ones who don't have homes to go to, who want to beat up on
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:55.340]   straight people in a way, or want to make straight people feel like they're kind of
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:59.580]   unremarkable, uncool, boring straights.
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:01.500]   So boring.
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:08.140]   So, not like the magical pixie fairy dust gays.
[01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.980]   That's a bad idea to push that one.
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:11.980]   That's a bad idea.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.780]   And some gays push that.
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:21.500]   Very unwise, given the fact that about 2-3% of the population are actually gay, although
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:26.660]   now there's like an additional 20% who think they're like two-spirit or something, and
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:27.660]   all that bullshit.
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:34.380]   But they're just attention seekers, so let's not spend too much time on that.
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:40.980]   But equally, as I've said in "The Madness of Crowds" with the feminist movement, very
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:47.340]   unwise for half of the species to say that the other half of the species isn't needed.
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:54.100]   And there were always third and fourth wave feminists willing to make that nuts argument.
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:56.380]   Not first wave feminists, you didn't hear it in first wave feminists, you didn't hear
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:15:00.420]   it, suffragettes tended not to say, "We'd like the vote."
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:06.700]   And men, a scum, it would have been hard to have won everyone over to their side, not
[01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.400]   least the men they needed to win over to their side.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:14.320]   But you do get third and fourth wave feminists who say, "Do we need men?"
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.440]   Or "Men are all X."
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:16.840]   Again, it's a bad idea.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:19.920]   It's a bad idea tactically.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:28.880]   - What if men, Richard Wrangham, somebody from Harvard, describes that men are the originators
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.800]   of violence, physical violence in society.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.880]   And he argues that actually the world would be better off.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:38.720]   - No, just a very cold calculus.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:44.160]   If you get rid of men, there would be a lot less violence in society is his claim.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:47.720]   - But who says you need to get rid of violence in society?
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.400]   - But shouldn't that at least be a discussion?
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.760]   - I'm very happy with the discussion.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:55.760]   - Have a debate, a panel discussion, violence, pros and cons.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.440]   - Well that's the sort of thing, if I can say so, that some weak ass academic decides
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:06.480]   to do because he thinks that his area of Boston would be nicer or whatever.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:13.840]   He might decide it's useful if he was living in Kiev today to have violent men.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:20.000]   I mean, it might, if New York was invaded right now, I'd need some violent men around
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   here.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.920]   - But it wouldn't be invaded if there's no violent men.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.960]   - Well that's- - There's the argument.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:34.000]   - There's also, at least there's some level of threat that you ought to exude that puts
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.780]   people off.
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:42.760]   If I was in, you know, I'm very glad that the men and women of Ukraine are capable of,
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:48.680]   and more than capable of, fighting for their country and for their neighbors and their
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:50.080]   families and much more.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:56.160]   But it's better that, that there was violence ready to unleash when violence was unleashed
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:03.360]   upon them than that the whole society had been told that they should identify as non-binary.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:10.600]   - But at least it's a conversation to have, isn't there, isn't there aspect to the sort
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:17.200]   of the feminist movement that is correct in challenging the-
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.080]   - Some forms of violence, domestic violence for instance, although women are capable of
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.000]   that as well.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.440]   - I'm learning about this.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.800]   We're all learning about this at the moment.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:30.880]   - I can't help but watch the entirety of it go down in this beautiful mess that is human
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.880]   relations.
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:32.880]   Okay.
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:39.400]   - But just to finish up that thought, it's very unwise for women to war against men,
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.400]   as it would be for men to war against women.
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:45.440]   It's highly, highly unwise to war on a majority population.
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:49.920]   And in America, Britain and other Western countries, white people are still a majority.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:55.360]   And so why would you tell the majority that they're evil by dint of their skin color and
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:59.120]   think that that would be a good way to keep them in check?
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.720]   I mean, I'm not guilty of anything because of my skin color.
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.440]   I'm not guilty of anything.
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.980]   My ancestors didn't do anything wrong.
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:10.120]   And even if they had, why would I be held responsible for it?
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:17.080]   - So to go back to Nietzsche, is there some aspect to where if we try to explain the forces
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:24.040]   at play here, is it the will to power playing itself out from individual human nature and
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:28.400]   from group behavior nature?
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:33.720]   Is there some elements to this, which is the game we play as human beings is always when
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:37.240]   we have less power, we try to find ways to gain more power?
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.400]   - That's certainly one.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:46.000]   The desire to grab is, let me see if I can find a quote for you on that.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:56.840]   The desire to grab that which we think we're owed and to do it often in the guise of justice.
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.940]   I mean, justice is one of the great terms of our age and one of the very great bogus
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:04.040]   terms of our age.
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:06.240]   People forever talk about their search for justice.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.960]   It's amazing how violent they can often be in their search for justice and how many rules
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.240]   they're willing to break so long as they can say they're after justice and how many norms
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:18.600]   they can trample so long as they can say it's in the name of justice.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:22.000]   You can burn down buildings in the name of justice.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.200]   - The majority groups throughout history, including those with white skin color, have
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.440]   done the same in the name of justice.
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:34.440]   We come up with all kinds of sexy terms in our propaganda machines to sell whatever atrocities
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.800]   we'd like to commit.
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:41.280]   - One of the quotes from Nietzsche that I liked, and I quoted in this.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.240]   - Careful, I'm judging you harshly.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.240]   - Of course.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:50.800]   Nietzsche says that one of the dangers of men of resentment is they'll achieve their
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:57.400]   ultimate form of revenge, which is to turn happy people into unhappy people like themselves,
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:01.480]   to shove their misery in the faces of the happy so that in due course the happy, and
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:06.200]   this is quoting Nietzsche, "start to be ashamed of their happiness and perhaps say to one
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.960]   another it's a disgrace to be happy.
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.000]   There is too much misery."
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   This is something to be averted.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.920]   "For the sick," says Nietzsche, "must not make the healthy sick too, or make the healthy
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:20.240]   confuse themselves with the sick."
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:24.260]   Well, I think that again, there's a lot of that going on.
[01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:27.240]   How could I be happy when there is unhappiness in the world?
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:31.120]   Why should I not join the ranks of the unhappy?
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.960]   - I think Dostoevsky has a book about that as well.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:34.960]   - Sure.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:35.960]   - "Nos from Underground."
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:36.960]   Okay.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:41.640]   This has been very Russian, Russian focused.
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:45.240]   I'm very pleased with the number of times both Dostoevsky and Grossman and others have
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.240]   come in.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:48.840]   I wasn't doing this as a sort of...
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:57.160]   - Yeah, well, it's always good to plug the greats and get to know they're still relevant.
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.920]   Do you speak Russian, by the way, at all?
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:00.920]   - Which I did.
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:05.520]   I'm told it's a 10-year language, basically, to learn from scratch, as my friends who have
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.520]   done it.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.640]   - Well, there's the language and then there's the personality behind the language and the
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:13.000]   personality I feel like you already have.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.800]   So you just need to know the surface details.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.440]   Okay.
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:24.200]   In fact, the silence, to be silent in the Russian language is something that's already
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:25.200]   important.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:27.680]   - If we had a moment, I'd tell you my story about Stalin's birthplace.
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:28.680]   Should I tell you that?
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:29.680]   - No.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:31.720]   - I once went to Gori, where Stalin was born.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.720]   Have you been?
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:33.720]   - No.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:37.600]   - I was there just after the Georgia War.
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:43.080]   And I went to the no man's land in south of Setya and Abkhazia.
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:48.280]   And I said, "I've really got to go to Gori or somewhere," because a shell had landed
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.800]   in Gori, rather weirdly, from the Russian side.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.640]   And Gori is where Stalin was born.
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.920]   And of course, Gori's in Georgia.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:01.600]   And anyhow, the museum of Stalin's birthplace, they'd been trying to change for some years
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:06.760]   because it had been unadulteratedly pro-Stalin for years.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:13.360]   And the Georgian authorities, this is in Chekhovili's time, were trying to make it into a museum
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.360]   of Stalinism.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:17.560]   And it was really tough.
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:21.360]   The only place I've seen which is similar is the house in Mexico City where Trotsky
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.280]   was killed.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.520]   That also is like they're not quite sure what to do.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:31.280]   They don't want to say he's a bad guy because they think that people won't come anyhow.
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.240]   Stalin's house in Gori had changed from a museum of Stalinism to a museum of Stalinism.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:38.440]   There was this large Georgian woman with a pink pencil who had clearly been doing the
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.040]   tour for 50 years.
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.040]   And just pointed all the facts.
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:47.680]   She did that classic thing I've also saw once in North Korea, that sort of communist thing
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.880]   where they say, "This is 147 feet high by 13 feet deep."
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:53.880]   It gives you lots of facts.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:54.880]   I don't care.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:55.880]   Why does it matter?
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.880]   It will give you facts.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.240]   This is Stalin's suitcase.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:04.960]   It is 13 inches wide by, you know, this.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:09.720]   Anyhow, this woman did all of this and it was all just wildly pro, not pro Stalin, just
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:10.720]   explained Stalin's life.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.840]   It was just a great local boy done good.
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:19.200]   They didn't mention the fact he killed more Georgians per capita than anyone else.
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:24.420]   And we get to the end and before being taken to the gift shop where they sell red wine
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:33.800]   with Stalin's face on it, among other things, and a lighter with Stalin on it, they took
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:38.520]   you to a little room under the stairs and they said, "This is a replica of interrogation
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:44.520]   cell to represent horror of what happened in Stalin time.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.520]   Now gift shop."
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:50.720]   And I took the woman aside at the end.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:51.720]   I scourged her.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:53.720]   She'd said this to other journalists who had visited before.
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:58.000]   I took her aside and I said, "What do you think about comrade Stalin?"
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.820]   And she said, let's say she'd obviously done this during communist times.
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:10.200]   She said, "It's not my place to judge," that sort of thing, which is an interesting comment
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.200]   in itself.
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:15.320]   I said, "Yeah, but he killed more Georgians than anyone," and all that sort of thing.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:19.280]   She said, "It's not my place to judge or to give my views," and that sort of thing.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.680]   And eventually I said, "Well, what do you feel about it?"
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:26.720]   And she said, "It was like a hurricane.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:27.720]   It happened."
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:34.940]   - That's interesting because if I may mention Clubhouse once again, I got a chance to talk
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:36.880]   to a few people from Mongolia.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:44.040]   There's a woman from Mongolia and they talked about the fact that they deeply admire Stalin.
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.960]   She sounded, if I may, hopefully that's not crossing the line.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:55.120]   I think I'm representing her correctly in saying she admired him almost like loved him,
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:25:00.040]   like the way people love Jesus, like a holy figure.
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:03.800]   - But isn't that still the case in large parts of Russia?
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:08.080]   Stalin keeps on winning greatest Russian of all time.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:12.320]   - And that's perhaps, maybe there's a dip, but if we were to think about the long arc
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:15.840]   of history, perhaps that's going to go up and up and up and up.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:21.640]   There's something about human memory that you forget the details of the atrocities of
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.720]   the past and remember the--
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:26.520]   - I mean, think of the number of people we talk about as historical heroes.
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.520]   Napoleon.
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:34.680]   I mean, British people don't talk about Napoleon as a hero, but the French.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:36.760]   - You didn't think that Dostoyevsky, now again--
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.240]   - Now you're on tricky ground.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:44.320]   But the French are enormously admired of Napoleon and they had many admirable aspects of him.
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:49.800]   He was also an unbelievable brute and killed many people unnecessarily.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:55.360]   And there are lots of figures from history that we sort of cover that over with.
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:00.640]   Can we mention Churchill briefly?
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:08.600]   Because he is one of the, you could make a case for him being one of the great representers
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:12.440]   or great figures historically of Western civilization.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:17.160]   And then there's a lot of people from, not a lot.
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:22.520]   I have like three friends and one of them happens to be from London and they say that
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:26.520]   he's not a good person.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:27.560]   - Why?
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:33.320]   - So listen, this friend, we did not discuss, this is an opinion poll of the three friends,
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.480]   but I do know that there's quite a bit--
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.280]   - There's a backcash going on at the moment.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:42.280]   - At the moment and in general, there's a spirit like reflecting on the darker sides
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:47.360]   of some of these historical figures, like challenging history through, it's not just
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:56.360]   critical race theory, it's challenging history through, well, are the people we think of
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:59.480]   as heroes, what are their flaws?
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:05.280]   And are they in fact villains that are convenient?
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:12.880]   Sort of were there at the right time to accidentally do the right thing?
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:15.200]   - Accidentally?
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:21.280]   I hope this isn't the representative fair summation of your friend in London's views.
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.520]   - No, she's going to be quite mad at this, but I didn't say the name, so it could be
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.520]   any friend.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.520]   It could be--
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.520]   - But we know it's a she.
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.520]   - It's my girlfriend from Canada.
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:30.520]   Well, see, I--
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:31.520]   - You've given that away.
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:36.600]   - Well, that's, of course, I would not, I made that up completely.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:42.200]   It's all, just like my girlfriend in Canada, she's completely a figment of my imagination.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:48.360]   Nevertheless, Winston Churchill is somebody, I mean, just looking at, reading the rise
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:57.060]   and fall of the Third Reich is an incredible figure that to me, so much of World War II
[01:27:57.060 --> 01:28:02.560]   is marked, leading up to the war is marked by stunning amounts of cowardice by political
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:09.840]   leaders and it's fascinating to watch here this person clearly with the drinking and
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.840]   a smoking problem.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:11.840]   - What was it?
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.840]   I don't understand why that's a negative.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.680]   - No, I didn't say, you see--
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.760]   - Yeah, you throw it in as if it is.
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.720]   - No, well, it's called humor.
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.600]   I'll explain it to you one day what that means.
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:22.600]   But he stood--
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:25.340]   - I'll explain dry humor.
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:27.040]   - He stood up.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:35.640]   He stood up to what we now see as evil when at the time it was not so obvious to see.
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:40.800]   So, that's just a fascinating figure of Western civilization.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.320]   I'd love to get your comments.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:45.480]   - The real criticisms, I mean, smoking and drinking.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:50.200]   The real criticisms of Churchill are quite easy to sum up and I do so in the War on the
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.200]   West, actually.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:54.280]   I say these are the things that they now use against him.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:57.760]   You do enough to avert the Bengal famine in 1943, for instance.
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:01.720]   That's been shot down by numerous historians, including Indian historians.
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:08.080]   In the middle of a world war, Churchill did what he could to get grain supplies diverted
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:12.600]   from Australia to Bengal.
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:13.920]   The famine was appalling.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:14.920]   It was caused by a typhoon.
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:18.040]   It was not caused by Winston Churchill.
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:25.320]   And the idea that some, basically Indian nationalist historians have pumped out in recent years
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:34.440]   and just anti-Churchill figures that he actually wanted Indians to die is just total calumny.
[01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:39.080]   And when people claim, some people claim that, I mean, there was a few very ignorant scholars,
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:44.840]   nevertheless with some credentials, who claim that Churchill wanted the Indian population
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:47.360]   to basically be genocided.
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:52.640]   And it's complete nonsense, not least by the fact that during the period which in question
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:56.320]   the Indian population boomed.
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:59.940]   So that's one of the main ones.
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:03.480]   Another one is that he had some views that we now regard as racist.
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:10.160]   He definitely regarded races as being of different characters and that there were superior races
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:19.560]   and as it were, the white European was a superior culture.
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:26.440]   He was born in Victorian England, so he has some Victorian attitudes.
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:29.920]   These are things in the negative side of the ledger and as with all history, you should
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:32.240]   have a negative and a positive side of the ledger.
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:35.160]   Positive side of the ledger includes he almost certainly did more than any one human being
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:37.360]   to save the world from Nazism.
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.040]   So that should count as something.
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:46.080]   And one of the reasons I talk about Churchill in this regard is to stress that if you get,
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:49.560]   I'm not trying to stop anyone doing history at all.
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:53.480]   I don't think the revisionism of recent years about Churchill or the founding fathers of
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:56.920]   America or anyone else is anything I want to stop.
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:00.320]   I find it interesting, I find it interesting not least because it's so sloppy on occasions,
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:02.360]   but I find it interesting and it's important.
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:05.080]   And we should be able to see people in the round.
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:10.720]   But that includes recognizing the positive side of the ledger.
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:15.480]   And if you can't recognize that side, you're doing something else.
[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:17.040]   You're doing something else.
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:18.840]   It's not history.
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:23.560]   It's some form of politicking of a very particular kind.
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:26.200]   And I think it's the same thing with the founding fathers.
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:31.120]   There are some people for instance, certainly since the 90s who have pushed the Sally Hemings,
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:35.680]   Thomas Jefferson story to show that Thomas Jefferson was some kind of brute.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:41.480]   As a result, we see Jefferson's statue being removed from the council chamber in the city
[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:45.720]   we're sitting in last November by council members who said that Thomas Jefferson no
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.640]   longer represents our values.
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:56.600]   If you can't recognize greatness of Thomas Jefferson and that he had flaws, I mean, that's
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.680]   not a grown up debate.
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:01.600]   And weigh them and weigh them in the context of the time.
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:06.320]   But let me sort of throw a curveball at you then.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:10.960]   What about recognizing the positive and the negative of a fellow with nice facial hair
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:12.560]   called Karl Marx?
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.400]   - Sure, sure.
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:19.240]   I mean, I have a section in the "War in the West" as you know, where I go for Karl Marx
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:22.520]   with some glee.
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:29.400]   So he seems to have gotten some popularity in the West recently.
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:30.400]   - Not just recently, yeah.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.800]   I mean, he's had a resurgence recently.
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:33.800]   - Yes, resurgence.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:41.120]   - Well, that's because whenever things are seen to go wrong, people reach for other options.
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:44.200]   And when for instance, it's very hard for people to accumulate capital, it's not obvious
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.960]   that they're gonna become capitalists.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.760]   And so one thing that happens is people say, let's look at the Marxism thing again, see
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:52.960]   if that's a viable goer.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:58.040]   And my argument would simply be, point me to one place that's worked.
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:06.240]   - Well, the argument from the Marxist or the Marxian economists is that we've only really
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:08.640]   tried it once, the Soviets tried it.
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:12.240]   And then if there's a few people that kind of tried the Soviet thing.
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:13.880]   - Cuba tried it?
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:16.760]   - Well, they basically, it's an offshoot of the Soviet.
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:18.320]   - Sure, they tried it.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:19.320]   - Yes, they've tried it.
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:21.320]   - They tried it in Venezuela.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:23.560]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:27.640]   - So let's just quickly say, how did all these experiments go?
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:31.280]   - They did not, well, they failed in fascinating ways.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.280]   - They did, but they failed.
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:33.280]   - Yes, they failed.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:37.040]   - And we should stress, so grossly failed.
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:42.940]   So grossly failed that they threw millions and millions of people into completely thwarted
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:46.720]   lives that were much shorter than they should have been.
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:52.480]   - Yeah, so the lesson to learn there, you can learn several lessons.
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:34:00.000]   One is that anything that smells like Marxism is going to lead to a lot of problems.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:06.240]   Now another lesson could be, well, what is the fundamental idea that Marx had?
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:10.520]   He was criticizing capitalism and the flaws of capitalism.
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:13.600]   So is it possible to do better than capitalism?
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:16.960]   And that's, if you take that spirit, you start to wonder.
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:24.200]   That might actually become relevant in, I don't know, 20, 30, 50 years when the machines
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:27.760]   start doing more and more of the labor, all those kinds of things, you start to ask questions.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:31.920]   - You finally might get to Marx's dream of what the average day would look like.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:32.920]   - Yes.
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:36.560]   - Well, there's gonna be an awful lot of literary criticism then.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:41.720]   If you remember, that's what Marx said that we would be doing in the evening, the laborer
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:42.720]   in the evening.
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:47.800]   - He didn't know Twitter was a thing or Netflix, so he would change.
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:51.160]   - Are there things we could learn from Marx, plausibly, possibly?
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:54.000]   I can't think of anything myself offhand.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.040]   But to have a critique of capitalism isn't by any means a bad thing in this society.
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:03.320]   I'd rather that it was a critique of capitalism that showed how you improve capitalism, a
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:07.400]   critique of free market that showed how people could get better access to the free market,
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:10.880]   how you could ensure, for instance, that young people get onto the property ladder, things
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:11.880]   like that.
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:13.160]   Those are constructive things.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:16.480]   The people who say we must have Marxism, I mean, don't know what the hell they're talking
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:20.120]   about because that never leads to any of those things.
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:22.080]   - Haven't learned in the past.
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:23.200]   - It's never learned in the past.
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:29.240]   And at some point, you've got to try to work out how many attempts you make at this damn
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:34.800]   philosophy before you realize that every attempt always leads to the same thing.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:41.240]   We could pretend that fascism has never been properly tried and that it was unfortunate
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:46.040]   what happened in Nazi Germany, but that wasn't real fascism.
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:51.360]   And in Mussolini's fascism, it didn't go all that well, but it was a bit better.
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:54.880]   And maybe we could try a bit more Franco fascism.
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:58.720]   Nobody would have any time for this crap, nor should they.
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:02.240]   The people who try that are reviled and quite rightly.
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:04.840]   So why do we tolerate it with the Marxism thing?
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:08.840]   And it's a great mystery to me the way that people do tolerate it.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:14.000]   Always, always in this stupid way of saying we haven't done it yet.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:20.120]   If you keep trying the same recipe and every time it comes out as shit, it's that the recipe
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.120]   is shit.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:24.920]   - Well, sort of, I'm trying to practice here by playing devil's advocate practice, the
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:29.960]   same idea that you mentioned, which is when you say the word Marxism, should you throw
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:32.400]   out everything or should you ask a question?
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:34.720]   Is there a good ideas here?
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:40.640]   And the same, it's weighing the good and the bad and being able to do so calmly and thoughtfully.
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:41.640]   - Sure.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:46.360]   Do you know the famous George Orwell comment on the Stalinist?
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:47.360]   Do you know?
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:48.360]   - No.
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:51.360]   - That's one of my favorite quotes.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:57.680]   George Orwell in the early '40s gets into an argument with a Stalinist, who's obviously
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.000]   a Marxist.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.080]   And this is after the show trial, it's '37.
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:11.360]   This is when it's very clear what Marxism in the Russian form is.
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:16.800]   And Orwell is in the discussion with this Marxist and it goes on and on.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:22.240]   And eventually Orwell says, well, what about the show trials and what about what's happened
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:29.240]   in Ukraine and the famines and much more and the purges and the purges and the purges.
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:35.560]   And eventually the Stalinist says to Orwell, what Orwell knows he's going to say all along,
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:40.320]   which is he says, you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:43.640]   And Orwell says, where's the omelet?
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:49.320]   - Oh yeah, that's a good, that's a really good.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:52.680]   - Look at this by this stage, okay?
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:54.680]   How many- - Where's my damn omelet?
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:38:02.800]   - How many just messy, big, bloody, eggy piles have the Marxists created by now in country
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:05.440]   after country?
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:10.280]   Always next time they're going to produce the great omelet, but they never have and
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:14.760]   they never will because the whole thing is rotten from the start.
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:19.320]   But let me just also say one thing about, because of course Marx isn't as nice as he
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.320]   sounds.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:24.760]   And that's one of the things that I try to highlight in the book is if we're going to
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:28.040]   do this reductive thing of people in history and saying, well, they had views that were
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:32.080]   of their time and we must therefore condemn them for them.
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:34.400]   So fine, let's do the same thing with Marx.
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:37.360]   And there were things I quote in this book from Marxist letters, not least letters to
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:44.320]   Engels and indeed in his published writings, he was writing for the American press in the
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:54.000]   50s, the way he has horrible views on slavery and colonialism and much more.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.800]   But the main thing is, I mean, the horrible things he says about black people and the
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:59.480]   constant use of the N word.
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:03.520]   In fact, when I was doing the audio book for the "Wall of West," I had to decide, will
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:05.800]   I read out the quotes from Marx or not?
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:11.640]   If I had read them out, I'd have been canceled because people would have just said, you've
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:15.720]   been using the N word so much in this passage.
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:20.880]   And I slightly thought of doing it so that I could say I was only quoting Marx to try
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.040]   to hit the point home.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.320]   In the end, of course, I was sensible and decided not to.
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:27.760]   But Marxist letters are disgusting on these terms.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:35.400]   Since I highlighted this in this book and some of the media picked it up and have popularized
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:38.840]   this thing I'm trying to put into the system, which is if you're going to accuse Churchill
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:43.400]   of racism, if you're going to accuse Jefferson of racism, Washington of racism, and so on,
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:44.400]   what about Marx?
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:48.120]   The two things that Marxists have said since this came out has been, first of all, why
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:49.480]   are you saying this about Marx?
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:54.400]   He was a man of his time, like everyone else.
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.260]   And the second thing they say is, we don't go to Marx for his horrible, abhorrent views
[01:39:58.260 --> 01:39:59.260]   on race.
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:03.000]   They're talking about mixed race people as guerrillas and so on.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.360]   We don't go to him for that.
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:06.240]   We go to him for his economic theories.
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:13.840]   I say, okay, well, we don't go to Thomas Jefferson for his views on slaves.
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:21.560]   We don't go to Churchill for the precise language he used at points in the 1910s about Indians.
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:22.920]   Or his health advice.
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:23.920]   Or his health advice.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:27.120]   Actually, I do go to him for that.
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:28.120]   But-
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:29.120]   That explains so much.
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:31.900]   But let's have some standards on this.
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:36.120]   And that's why I'm very suspicious of the fact that the people don't do this with Marx,
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:39.760]   because I think what some people are trying to do, and this may sound conspiratorial,
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:41.440]   but I really don't think it is.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:45.960]   I think that some people are deliberately trying to completely clear the cultural landscape
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:51.700]   of our past in order to say there's nothing good, nothing you can hold on to, no one you
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:52.700]   should revere.
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:53.880]   You've got no heroes.
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.400]   The whole thing comes down.
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:56.400]   Who's left standing?
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:59.600]   Oh, we've also got this idea from the 20th century still about Marxism.
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:02.840]   Or the 19th and 20th centuries.
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:03.840]   And no.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:04.840]   No.
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:09.880]   You will not have the entire landscape deracinated.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:13.160]   And then the worst ideas tried again.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:17.200]   So basically destroy all of history and the lessons learned from history and then start
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:22.320]   from scratch and then it's completely any idea can work and then you can just take whatever.
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:26.040]   Well, and the thing is there are always some people with pre-prepared ideas.
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:27.960]   And I mentioned this also with the post-colonialists.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:30.760]   The post-colonialists were really interesting.
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:36.440]   Because when the European powers were moving from Africa and the Far East, post-colonial
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:42.280]   movements had one obvious move they could have done, which was to say since the European
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:46.560]   powers have left, we will return to a pre-colonial life.
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.560]   Which in some of their places would have been returning to slave markets and slave ownership
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:52.160]   and slave selling and much more.
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:54.400]   But put that aside for a second.
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.520]   They could have said we have an indigenous culture which we will return to.
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:05.000]   Just uniformly in the post-colonial era, you had figures like France Fanon, you had European
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:10.680]   intellectuals like Sartre who said the Western powers are retreating from these countries
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:15.560]   and therefore we should institute in these countries what but Western Marxism.
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:21.720]   Well, it's not obvious to me that like the bad ideas would be the ones that emerge, but
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:25.040]   it's more likely that the bad ideas would emerge in this kind of context when you erase
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:27.280]   history, when you erase tradition.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:33.480]   When you erase history and you leave some ideas deliberately uninterrogated.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:42.960]   I mean, as I say, find me one in a hundred American students who've heard of any of the
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:47.240]   communist despots of the 20th century.
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:53.160]   I mean, name recognition in, there was a poll done a few years ago in the UK and like name
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:43:02.040]   recognition among children, school children for Stalin, let alone Mao.
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:09.680]   I mean Mao who kills more people than anyone, 65 million Chinese perhaps.
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:16.600]   How many students in America know what Mao was, who he was, where he was, nothing.
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:18.120]   Or the atrocities committed.
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:19.120]   Where the atrocities were committed.
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:24.480]   And I worry about that because it means that we might have learned one of the two lessons
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:26.360]   of the 20th century.
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:30.440]   We think we've learned one of the two lessons of the 20th century.
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:32.200]   We actually haven't learned that lesson.
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:36.520]   We've learned a little bit of it and we've not learned the other one at all because that's
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:41.680]   why we still have people in American politics and elsewhere actually talking about collectivization
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:46.840]   and things as if there's no problem with that and as if it's perfectly obvious and they
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:49.760]   could run it and they'd know exactly where to stop.
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:51.840]   What are the two lessons of the 20th century?
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:54.840]   Fascism and communism.
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:44:00.720]   Yeah, I mean I'm not exactly sure what exactly the lessons are.
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:02.000]   No, it's not clear.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.040]   If the lessons were very clear we'd be better at it.
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:10.720]   Well one is your book broadly applied of madness of crowds.
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:12.040]   That's one lesson.
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:14.360]   How so?
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:19.360]   Something like large crowds can display herd-like behavior.
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:21.360]   Yes, be very suspicious of crowds.
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:22.360]   Yeah, in general.
[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:29.000]   I mean you apply it in different, more to modern application in a sense but that's rooted
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:34.640]   in history that crowds can, when humans get together they can do some quite radically
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:35.640]   silly things.
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:40.560]   Elias Kennetty's very good on that, crowds and power.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:48.000]   And Eric Hoffer who's a sort of self-taught amazing, not to say autodidactic writer, the
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.400]   true believer and so on.
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:51.560]   He was extremely good on that.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.760]   But the reason I mention the two things, no I mean we should have realized the two nightmares
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:57.640]   of the 20th century, fascism and communism.
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:01.800]   That we should know how they came about and we're interested in learning how one of them
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:02.800]   came about, fascism.
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:08.640]   And we know some of the lessons like don't treat other people as less than you because
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.400]   of their race.
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.400]   That's one lesson.
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:17.600]   But we've done some good at learning that.
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:23.600]   But the second one, not to do communism again, not to do socialism.
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:29.600]   I think we're way away from knowing because we don't know how it happened.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:32.160]   And the little temptations are still there always.
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:39.320]   Look at the people saying I'm going to expropriate your property.
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:40.520]   People do things they don't like.
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:43.040]   They will get, we can't wait to take your property.
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:47.600]   - Well there's a sense, there's an appealing sense.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:52.640]   Every ideology has an appealing narrative behind it that sells the ideology.
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:46:00.320]   So for socialism, for communism, it seems unfair that the working class does all of
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:05.200]   this work and gets only a fraction of the output.
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:07.200]   It just seems unfair.
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:11.480]   - If they do get a fraction of the output, yes.
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:12.480]   - Yes.
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:16.400]   And so it seems to be more fair if we increase that.
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:24.360]   If the workers own all of the value of their output and the things that are more fair seems
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:26.760]   to be a good thing.
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:31.960]   - I'd say, well yeah, I mean fairness is, I like fairness as a term.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:36.920]   No, I much prefer fairness because it's a much easier thing to try to work out.
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.920]   It's quite amorphous itself as a concept but everyone can recognize it.
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:50.600]   So for instance, should the boss of the company earn a million times that of the lowest paid
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:51.600]   employee?
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.960]   It doesn't seem fair.
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:47:00.920]   Should they earn maybe five or ten times the salary of the lowest paid employee?
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:01.960]   Yeah, possibly.
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:02.960]   That could be fair.
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:12.440]   There are certain sort of multiples which are within the bounds of reasonableness.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:20.320]   I think actually that's the much bigger problem in capitalism at the moment as I see it, is
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:26.920]   the not untrue perception that a tiny number of people get a lot of the, accrue a lot of
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:38.200]   the benefits and that the bit in the middle has become increasingly squeezed and is at
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:40.960]   danger always of falling all the way down to the bottom.
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:46.200]   I mean I think in the snakes and ladders of American capitalism for instance, it's a correct
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:51.600]   perception to say that the snakes go down awfully far.
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:58.640]   If you tread on the snake, you can plummet an awfully long way in America.
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:05.120]   And the deal in the game was that the ladders took you high and there's a perception, and
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:12.080]   again it's not entirely wrong, that the ladder system on the board is kind of broken.
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:14.920]   So what you're saying is you're a Marxist.
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:17.000]   I'm not saying I'm a Marxist.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:22.880]   You heard that here first in the out of context blog post you're going to write about this.
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:28.840]   I get back to this point, the way to critique capitalism if it's gone bad is to get better
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:29.840]   capitalism.
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:33.320]   Free markets where they're not fair should be made fair.
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:39.280]   Never decide that the answer is the thing that has never produced any human flourishing,
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:41.200]   i.e. Marxism.
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:45.880]   So as you describe in the madness of crowds, the herd-like behavior of humans that gets
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:54.200]   us into trouble, you as an individual thinker and others listening to this, how can you,
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:58.800]   because all of us are amidst crowds, we're influenced by the society that's around us,
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:02.680]   by the people that's around us, how can we think independently?
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:13.400]   How can we, you know, if you're in the Soviet Union at the beginning of the 20th century,
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:20.520]   if you're in, I don't know, Nazi Germany at the end of the 30s or 40s, how can you think
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:27.840]   independently given, first of all, that it's hard to think independently, just intellectually
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:33.760]   speaking, but also that it just becomes more and more dangerous.
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:39.680]   So the incentive to think independently under the uncertainty that's usually involved with
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:44.160]   thinking is, I mean, it's a silly thing to say, but on Twitter there is a cost to be
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:49.760]   paid for going against the crowd on any silly thing.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:55.440]   We can even talk about, what is it, Will Smith slapping Chris Rock.
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:59.040]   You know, there's a crowd that believes that that was unjustified.
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:01.960]   I forget what the crowd decided.
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:04.480]   - Crowd split on that one, it's safe to have one opinion either way.
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:05.680]   - Okay, it is, right.
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:10.680]   But there is, you put it very nicely, that there's clearly a calculus here and that you
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:14.760]   can measure on Twitter in particular, you can measure kind of the crowd, a sense of
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:16.440]   where the crowd lays.
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:17.440]   - Michael Jackson.
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:22.440]   - Well, oh boy.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:27.960]   I don't want to, this is not a legal discussion, I don't have my lawyer present.
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:28.960]   I don't even have a lawyer.
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:30.680]   - The man in question is dead.
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:35.120]   But I think most people who are not just diehard fans would concede that Michael Jackson had
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:43.600]   a strange relationship with children and was almost certainly a pedophile.
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:44.960]   - Did the crowd agree on that?
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:48.160]   - No, the crowd hasn't agreed because he's too famous and we all love thriller.
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:49.640]   - Yeah, we do.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:52.360]   So you said people who are not fans, I just don't.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:57.920]   - No, I'm a fan of Michael Jackson, but I think he was almost certainly a pedophile.
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:01.680]   But nobody wants to give up dancing to bad at weddings.
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:05.560]   So they just kind of added in, it's fine.
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:06.560]   Seriously.
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:10.760]   - But see, your law does not apply to Bill Cosby.
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:17.520]   - Ah, well, he was of course one of the most famous people in America, but maybe he wasn't
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:18.520]   regarded as talented.
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:22.280]   - Oh, wow, there's depth to this calculation.
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:26.240]   - Oh yeah, there's a genius opt-out in all cultures.
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.600]   There's a genius opt-out in all cultures.
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:28.600]   Look at Lord Byron.
[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:31.600]   Lord Byron shagged his sister.
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:32.600]   Doesn't affect his reputation.
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:34.960]   In fact, if anything, it kind of adds to it.
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:41.640]   - But then again, this kind of war against the West, genius actually makes you more likely
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:43.920]   or no to get canceled.
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:47.840]   So if you look at the genius of Thomas Jefferson or--
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:51.200]   - Well yes, because if you haven't done anything remarkable, nobody will come looking for you
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:52.200]   past tremendously.
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:53.200]   - Okay.
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:54.200]   - Yeah.
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:55.200]   - So a genius can get you in trouble eventually.
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:56.200]   - Sidle through life.
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:57.200]   - Okay.
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:51:58.200]   - Sidle through life with nobody noticing.
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:06.200]   You're totally harmless and then die and hope you haven't used any carbon.
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:13.800]   But you were asking about how to survive the era of social media, as it were, and the crowds.
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:17.120]   And there's a very simple answer to that.
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:21.240]   Don't overrate the significance of the unreal world.
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:24.760]   - Oh, come on, but this is still human psychology.
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:26.040]   Because you want to fit in.
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:27.480]   There's a, you want to--
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:28.480]   - Why?
[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:31.840]   - Because you like people and you're just as a--
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:34.840]   - Why not just like a small number of people and ignore the rest?
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:35.840]   - Yeah, that's--
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:36.840]   - That's what I do.
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:37.840]   - Well, I--
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:39.440]   - I mean, I actually like most people.
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:40.680]   This isn't a general thing.
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:44.000]   I don't have detestation for most people at all.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.600]   Most people I come with I enjoy speaking with and being with.
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:54.680]   But in terms of storing your sense of self-worth in absolute strangers, big mistake.
[01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:55.680]   - Yeah.
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:58.880]   - So, me, that's, this is now, this turned into a therapy session.
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:03.840]   Because for me, and I think I represent some number of population, is I'm pretty self-critical.
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:06.520]   I'm looking for myself in the world.
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:10.680]   And there is a depth of connection with people on the internet.
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:11.680]   I mean, I have some--
[01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:13.360]   - I think there's a shallowness of it.
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.360]   - It's shallow connection.
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:15.360]   Interesting.
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:16.360]   I--
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.360]   - Put it this way.
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:21.080]   If you became very ill tomorrow, would any of them help?
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:22.080]   - On the internet?
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:23.080]   No.
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:24.080]   - No.
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:25.080]   - No.
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:26.080]   - No.
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:27.080]   - No.
[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:28.080]   - But then at the end of the day, yeah, you're right.
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:30.080]   Very close friends would help, family would help.
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:31.080]   Yeah.
[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:32.080]   - Yeah.
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:33.080]   - And perhaps that's the only thing--
[01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:44.040]   - You can't store significant amounts of trust or faith or belief or self-worth in places
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:46.360]   which will not return it to you.
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:47.440]   - Okay.
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:50.080]   So let's talk about the more extreme case, the harsher case.
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:57.880]   When you talk about the things you talk about in the war on the West and madness of crowds,
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:03.920]   I mean, you're getting a lot of blowback, I'm sure.
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:09.760]   As for the listener, you just shrugged lightly with a zen-like look on your face.
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:16.920]   So you don't, all you need is Sam Harris to say that you're brilliant and you're happy.
[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:20.040]   - No, I'm very, I love Sam.
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:21.040]   - Yeah.
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:25.840]   - I'm deeply pleased when he flatters me, and he's nice about me, but no, I don't just
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:26.840]   reliance on him.
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:31.840]   No, I mean, why would I mind?
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:34.960]   I mean, maybe it's self-selecting.
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:40.760]   If I didn't have the view I had about that or whatever armory it is that I have on that,
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.720]   I wouldn't do what I did maybe.
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:47.320]   - I mean, have you been to some dark places psychologically because of the challenging
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:52.160]   ideas you explore, like significant self-doubt, just kind of?
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:55.400]   - I can't say I've been unaffected by everything in my life.
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:55:01.240]   By any means, that would make me an automaton of some kind.
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:05.640]   There's definitely times I've got things wrong and regretted that.
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:14.200]   There's times I've, there was a period around the time I wrote my book, "The Strange Death
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:22.320]   of Europe," which was a very, very dark time.
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:26.080]   It wasn't because I was having a dark time in my life, but because of the book I was
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:27.080]   writing.
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:32.080]   - Oh, because of the places you had to go in order to write the book.
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:33.080]   - Yeah.
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:37.560]   Well, I was contemplating the end of a civilization.
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:43.220]   Occasionally now, I have maybe slightly too pat at this stage, but sometimes readers come
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:48.000]   up to me in the street or whatever and say, "I love 'The Strange Death of Europe.'"
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:51.200]   And will say, "Very depressing book to read, however."
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:56.840]   I would say, "Well, you should have tried writing it."
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:56:05.480]   But it was because it has chunks of it which I'm very proud of, in particular about the
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:12.160]   death of religion, the death of God, the loss of meaning, and the void.
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:17.240]   And that's difficult stuff to write about and to grapple with.
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:23.920]   And there is a sort of, I haven't re-read that book since it came out, but I think there
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:29.720]   are passages in it which reveal what I was thinking very clearly in the poetry of it
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:35.080]   as it were, as well as the detail.
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:46.440]   But yeah, I can't say, I'm used to saying what I think and what I see.
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:51.240]   And if there's any pushback I've got from that, I'm completely consoled that I'm saying
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:55.000]   what I see with my own eyes.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.160]   - That's your source of strength, is that you're always seeking the truth as best you
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:00.160]   see it.
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:07.720]   - I can't agree to go along with a lie if I've seen something with my own eyes.
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:14.640]   - So speaking of Sam Harris, and I mentioned to you offline, I talk to a lot of smart people
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:20.720]   in my private life on this podcast, and a lot of them will reference you as their example
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:23.500]   of a very smart person.
[01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:34.060]   So given that compliment, do you ever worry that your ego grows to a level where you're
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:38.220]   not, what you think is the truth is no longer the truth?
[01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:44.580]   Is this kind of, it blinds you?
[01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:51.060]   And also, on top of that, the fact that you stand against the crowd often, that there's
[01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:56.340]   part of it that appeals to you, that you like to point out the emperor has no clothes.
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:59.540]   - I get a certain thrill from the friction.
[01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:07.700]   - That sometimes both your ego and the thrill of friction will get you to deviate from the
[01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:10.620]   truth and instead just look for the friction.
[01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:13.940]   - Could do, could do for sure.
[01:58:13.940 --> 01:58:18.020]   I try to keep alive to that.
[01:58:18.020 --> 01:58:25.220]   Early in my career I realized that, for instance, I didn't want to make enemies unnecessarily,
[01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:29.020]   any more than strictly necessary, because there was a very large number of already necessary
[01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:30.020]   enemies.
[01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:35.020]   And I remember once, I won't go into the details, but I already had one sort of thing I'd done
[01:58:35.020 --> 01:58:39.540]   that week, and then another thing came out, and I just thought, I can't do that.
[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:46.300]   And I remember thinking, don't be the sort of person who's forever creating storms.
[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:51.180]   And I tried to make sure I wasn't, and I think I pretty much stuck to that.
[01:58:51.180 --> 01:58:59.540]   But to answer your question, well, the first thing is I'm as confident as I can be that
[01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:04.220]   I wouldn't fall into the trap you described for two reasons.
[01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:10.780]   One is that I don't think of myself as a wildly intelligent person, partly because I'm very,
[01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:14.300]   very aware of the things I know nothing about.
[01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:26.260]   For instance, I have almost no knowledge of the details of finance or economic theory.
[01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:28.100]   I mean, the real details.
[01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:30.900]   I don't mean the big picture of the kind that we were just discussing earlier.
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:44.700]   But if you put the periodic table in front of me, I would struggle to do more than a
[01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:47.700]   handful.
[01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:53.780]   I am very conscious of huge gaps in my knowledge.
[01:59:53.780 --> 01:59:59.220]   And where I have gaps or chasms, I tend to find I have a disproportionate admiration
[01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:01.100]   for the people who know that stuff.
[02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:05.500]   I'm wildly impressed by people who understand money, really understand it.
[02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:10.340]   They sort of think, "How the hell do you do that?"
[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:17.260]   And the same thing with biologists, medics, stuff I just know very little about.
[02:00:17.260 --> 02:00:19.740]   - And that's a source of humility for you, just knowing that.
[02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:24.860]   - Yes, I think I'm okay on that stuff, but Jesus, if you got me on the general knowledge,
[02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:32.620]   I would say that some years ago, there's a thing in the UK called University Challenge.
[02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:38.140]   I was asked some years ago on to, there's a sort of celebrity, one of former students
[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:43.540]   of the universities or colleges, asked to go back for the Christmas special.
[02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:47.100]   And I was asked to be one of the people from my old college to go back and compete in the
[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:49.300]   sort of celebrity alumni one.
[02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:51.860]   And the only reason I actually wanted to do it was because I discovered that Louis Theroux
[02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:53.660]   had been to my college before my time.
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:55.980]   And he'd agreed to be on the team.
[02:00:55.980 --> 02:00:57.700]   And I thought, "I'd love to meet Louis Theroux.
[02:00:57.700 --> 02:00:59.500]   That'd be great fun."
[02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:02.020]   And anyhow, and I said, "Well, I really don't want to do it."
[02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:03.260]   And they said, "Come on, you'd be great."
[02:01:03.260 --> 02:01:04.260]   I said, "I wouldn't.
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:07.700]   I'd show myself up and be a total asshole and ignoramus."
[02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:13.820]   And as it was, I sat down my flat and I watched some past episodes of University Challenge.
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:20.580]   I realized I'd just sat in mute for the whole half hour.
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:25.620]   I just couldn't, the first question was about physics and the second one was about...
[02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:31.020]   As it was, I watched the one and I could answer the first two or three questions of the one
[02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:35.860]   that actually went out because they made it a bit simpler.
[02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:39.140]   But I mean, I'm terribly conscious of the fact, and I said to the producers, I said,
[02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:42.140]   "I can't go on because I just couldn't answer the questions."
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:46.220]   These unbelievably smart students seem to be able to answer on a whole range of things.
[02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:51.620]   So I'm perfectly aware of my limitations.
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:53.340]   - You contemplate your limitations.
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:56.860]   - Yeah, and they're forever before me.
[02:01:56.860 --> 02:01:59.500]   Not hard to find in every day.
[02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:08.540]   And then on top of that, I suppose it's, in a way, you know that line from Rudyard Kipling's
[02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:13.940]   alternately brilliant and slightly nauseating poem, "If."
[02:02:13.940 --> 02:02:14.940]   There's a line-
[02:02:14.940 --> 02:02:17.060]   - You just enjoy a good poem, can't you?
[02:02:17.060 --> 02:02:18.060]   - Well, no, it's not-
[02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:19.060]   - Where's the noise?
[02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:23.260]   - I can enjoy a great poem, but I mean, a good poem.
[02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:26.340]   This is slightly off, but-
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:30.620]   - This goes to your criticism of Dostoevsky.
[02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:33.780]   Take Douglas' criticism with a grain of salt.
[02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:40.940]   - Maybe I've read it too many memorial services and things, but that line is a good piece
[02:02:40.940 --> 02:02:46.620]   of advice, "If you can learn to meet triumph and disaster and greet these two imposters
[02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:47.620]   just the same."
[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:48.620]   That's a good line.
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:53.420]   It's a good line, as Kipling often did, an amazing turn of line.
[02:02:53.420 --> 02:03:01.220]   But I do think that it's a very sensible thing to try to greet triumph and disaster and regard
[02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:04.020]   them as imposters and greet them just the same.
[02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:10.060]   And actually, anyone who knows me knows that I never, partly it's because I have a sort
[02:03:10.060 --> 02:03:15.140]   of belief in the old gods, and at the moment that I thought that I was at the moment of
[02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:22.200]   triumph, the fates would hitch up their skirts and run at me at a million miles an hour.
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:31.220]   But it's also because anyone who knows me knows I never have a moment when I say, "That's
[02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:32.460]   just great.
[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:37.340]   I feel totally fulfilled and victorious."
[02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:41.860]   I mean, it happened to me recently when "War in the West" went straight to number one in
[02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:43.420]   the bestseller list.
[02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:45.620]   - How long did that last in terms of your self-satisfaction?
[02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:46.620]   - It didn't happen.
[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:49.980]   - Not even for a brief moment?
[02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:51.720]   - No.
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:55.420]   When I first saw that it was selling, I had that moment of elation.
[02:03:55.420 --> 02:03:58.100]   I thought, "Good, I've done it.
[02:03:58.100 --> 02:03:59.100]   It's out."
[02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:03.300]   And I did have a moment of elation then, definitely.
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:07.340]   But it doesn't last, partly because I tell myself it mustn't last.
[02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:12.780]   - Because as you said, fate hitches up its skirt.
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:15.500]   Is that skirts?
[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:20.620]   You brits with your poetry, even when it's nauseating.
[02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:27.300]   As of 2022, this year, what's your final analysis of the political leadership and the human
[02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:32.460]   mind and the human being of Donald Trump?
[02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:34.900]   - I sort of avoided this for years.
[02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:35.900]   - Just talking about Trump?
[02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:37.300]   - I tried to avoid talking about Trump for years.
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:39.740]   It's the same reason I tried to avoid writing about Brexit.
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:44.460]   - Do you think that Trump, just sorry on a small tangent, do you think that Trump's story
[02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:47.660]   is over or are we just done with volume one?
[02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:48.660]   - I've no idea.
[02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:54.580]   The people I know who know him say that he's running.
[02:04:54.580 --> 02:05:03.100]   And I think that in general, Republicans have to, do have a choice in front of them.
[02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:11.380]   One friend put it to me recently, said, "You've got to go in with your toughest fighter."
[02:05:11.380 --> 02:05:15.700]   And I understand that instinct.
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:20.740]   And I also think it's a very dangerous instinct, because what if your toughest fighter is also
[02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:23.940]   your biggest liability?
[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:28.220]   What's the best way to get out the Democrat vote in 2024 than to have Donald Trump running?
[02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:32.820]   - And the people that are doing the war in the West, they're pretty tough fighters.
[02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:34.340]   - They are.
[02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:39.180]   And I'm cautious about this because I know every way I tread is dangerous, but let me
[02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:40.180]   just be frank.
[02:05:40.180 --> 02:05:41.180]   - Tread gracefully.
[02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:50.020]   - I'll tread as gracefully as I can in my Wellington boots, in my galoshes.
[02:05:50.020 --> 02:05:52.500]   Here's the thing.
[02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:54.620]   I think everybody knows what Trump is.
[02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:57.060]   I think we all knew for years.
[02:05:57.060 --> 02:06:02.740]   And I feel sorry for the conservatives who had to pretend that he was something he wasn't.
[02:06:02.740 --> 02:06:09.700]   I felt sorry for the ones who had to pretend that, for instance, he was some devout Christian
[02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:16.660]   or a man of faith or a man of great integrity or all of these sorts of things.
[02:06:16.660 --> 02:06:21.580]   Because in the public eye for years, it'd been obvious that wasn't the case.
[02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:26.520]   But he has something extraordinary.
[02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:33.140]   One thing is a method of communication that you've just got to say was unbelievable.
[02:06:33.140 --> 02:06:36.140]   - In one fundamental way that you can't look away for some reason.
[02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:37.140]   - Can't look away.
[02:06:37.140 --> 02:06:45.660]   I mean, watching him clear everyone out of the way in 2016 was thrilling because those
[02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:47.340]   people needed clearing away.
[02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:53.260]   I mean, it's just horrifying what America's going to give us another Bush.
[02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:57.420]   What's so great about this family?
[02:06:57.420 --> 02:06:58.420]   America's going to give us another Clinton.
[02:06:58.420 --> 02:07:01.540]   We're going to get to choose between a Clinton and a Bush.
[02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:05.020]   Mark Stein said, "We'll just wait for the day the Clintons and the Bushes into Mary
[02:07:05.020 --> 02:07:08.860]   and then we can really have a monarchy again."
[02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:12.140]   So I was very pleased to see him clear them away.
[02:07:12.140 --> 02:07:18.780]   I was very pleased to see him sort of raise some of the issues that needed raising.
[02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:24.860]   I thought it was a sort of breath of fresh air and I wished it wasn't him doing it.
[02:07:24.860 --> 02:07:28.060]   And then there was a question of him governing and it was just perfectly clear he didn't
[02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:30.540]   know how to govern.
[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:35.380]   What he did have, however, what he does have is an incredible ability to fight.
[02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:38.460]   And some of the forces he was arraigned against were arraigned against him.
[02:07:38.460 --> 02:07:41.580]   My gosh, they would have taken down anyone else.
[02:07:41.580 --> 02:07:51.420]   I mean, they'd have probably done some similar BS against Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio.
[02:07:51.420 --> 02:07:56.580]   They'd have said, some people admitted, they'd have accused all these people of racism and
[02:07:56.580 --> 02:07:59.180]   misogyny and everything else as well, just like they did Mitt Romney, just like they
[02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:01.380]   did John McCain.
[02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:06.660]   But Trump was the one ugly enough and bruisy enough to fight.
[02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:17.980]   And also a willingness or a lack of willingness to play sort of the civil game of politics
[02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:23.700]   at a party when politeness gets you in trouble.
[02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:28.260]   You show up and everybody's polite and you just out of momentum want to be being polite
[02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:33.500]   and all of a sudden you're on an island with Jeffrey Epstein and it gets you into a huge
[02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:34.660]   amount of trouble.
[02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:39.660]   But so Trump has these sort of extraordinary qualities, but I just, you know, look, he
[02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:44.580]   screwed up during his time in office because he didn't achieve as much as he should have
[02:08:44.580 --> 02:08:45.580]   done.
[02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:47.900]   And you could say that about every president, but I refuse to acknowledge that two years
[02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:52.420]   when he had both houses in the beginning, he just didn't know what levers to pull.
[02:08:52.420 --> 02:08:56.920]   You know, I mean, he was sitting in the office behind the Oval Office tweeting, watching
[02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:57.920]   the news.
[02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:00.740]   I'm sorry, that's not a president.
[02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:06.180]   And he couldn't fill and didn't fill positions because people knew, I mean, people who were
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:10.900]   very loyal to him, he would just, you know, he'd get them to do something loyal and then
[02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:12.780]   destroy them.
[02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:17.500]   And I think, and then we get onto the thing about, and here we get onto the, you know,
[02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:22.340]   what of course is very, very fractious terrain, but, you know, I covered the 2020 election
[02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:27.700]   and I was traveling all around the states and I went to Trump rally and all sorts of
[02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:28.700]   stuff.
[02:09:28.700 --> 02:09:34.700]   And I, I mean, I was in DC on election night and, um, when, and it got very ugly at one
[02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:39.900]   point, um, in so-called black lives matter Plaza, when it looked like Trump might win
[02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:44.500]   when Florida came in and got really, I could feel the air were very, very heated.
[02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:48.980]   And I, some Antifa people started getting into black block and this sort of stuff.
[02:09:48.980 --> 02:09:54.780]   And I thought this town was going to burn, you know, if, if Trump wins and in the aftermath
[02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:58.420]   of the vote, I was willing to hang around and watching for a bit.
[02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:00.820]   And then I saw it, it was going to drag on.
[02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:04.260]   And I saw some of his people and others and people told me they had great evidence of
[02:10:04.260 --> 02:10:06.460]   vote rigging and all this sort of thing.
[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:11.540]   And I'm afraid I'm one of those people who doesn't believe that the evidence that they
[02:10:11.540 --> 02:10:16.340]   presented is good enough to justify the claim that he won the election.
[02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:19.700]   And I, and people say, have you seen 2000 mules?
[02:10:19.700 --> 02:10:23.340]   And have you seen, look, the evidence isn't there.
[02:10:23.340 --> 02:10:27.060]   But the, the election was won by Donald Trump.
[02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:34.260]   And I think that what he did on January the 6th was unbelievably dangerous.
[02:10:34.260 --> 02:10:38.900]   And you know, here it is possible for us to hold two ideas in our head at the same time.
[02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:46.220]   January the 6th was not nothing, nor was it an insurrection and attempt to stage a coup.
[02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:53.260]   And there's a vanishing number of people in the U S or as Eric Weinstein said, that the
[02:10:53.260 --> 02:10:57.740]   it's like, this is the, the, the roof that you have to walk along.
[02:10:57.740 --> 02:11:03.740]   And like the, the sides are very steep if you fall off either side.
[02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:10.380]   Is there some sense given the forces that are waging war in the West, you said this
[02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:17.220]   feeling perhaps because of Antifa or something else that this town is going to burn and maybe
[02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:22.980]   a continued feeling that this town is going to burn with the January 6th events.
[02:11:22.980 --> 02:11:30.820]   Are you worried about the future of the United States in the coming years because of the,
[02:11:30.820 --> 02:11:33.780]   the, the, there's a feeling of escalation.
[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:41.300]   Is that just a war of Twitter or is there, is there a real brewing of something?
[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:42.620]   Oh, it's real.
[02:11:42.620 --> 02:11:45.740]   And how, well, let me then respond to that.
[02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:47.700]   How, what is the hopeful?
[02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:55.500]   If you, if you 10 years from now, look back at the United States and say, we turned it
[02:11:55.500 --> 02:11:58.580]   around, what would be the reason?
[02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:01.220]   What would be the ways, the mechanisms that we do so?
[02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:06.780]   I'll tell you, since I, since I wrote this book, there are two things in particular that
[02:12:06.780 --> 02:12:12.500]   I've been really pleased that a specific type of specialists has approached me on to say
[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:17.400]   that things I've written about actually have more application than I realized.
[02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:19.820]   One is the gratitude issue.
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:26.040]   A number of people have approached me who have gone through AA, Alcoholics Anonymous.
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:27.820]   They sometimes say, have you ever been to AA?
[02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:31.780]   And that's a bit personal question.
[02:12:31.780 --> 02:12:37.360]   But they say, but the reason they ask it is because they say, well, because if you go
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:44.740]   to drug rehabilitation or alcohol anonymous, Norm MacDonald said, it doesn't sound very
[02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:45.740]   anonymous.
[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:48.560]   It's like when you say your name and you tell everyone the worst things you've ever done.
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:50.480]   That's the opposite of anonymous.
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:55.640]   Anyhow, but they say, look, because if you go to these things, apparently you're asked
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:13:01.520]   to as part of your recovery, say what you're grateful for, like list what you're grateful
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:02.520]   for.
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:05.300]   I didn't know that by the way, until, until, until the book was out.
[02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:08.280]   And so that turned out to have more application than I knew.
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:12.160]   The other thing though, is that I say that it's absolutely crucial in America that we
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:14.560]   try to find things that we agree on.
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:18.280]   And a couple of times since the book came out, I've been approached by people who marriage
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:22.680]   counselors, um, but we've also said, I mean, we've been through marriage counseling.
[02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:25.200]   Again, that's a very personal question.
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:27.800]   Stop asking me personal questions.
[02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:30.960]   No, but they, and I say, well, why?
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:38.360]   Because this is, this is one of the things that we do in couples therapy is trying to
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:41.800]   find things you agree on.
[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:47.920]   And I think this is very important in America and it's made much harder by the fact, and
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:52.560]   I've said this many times, but forgive me if I'm repeating myself, but it's made much
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:57.600]   harder by the fact that having different opinions is very last century.
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:03.160]   Now we all have different facts or at least the two sides have different facts.
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:07.920]   One half of the country, roughly, or let's say 40%, 30%, whatever you want to put it
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:12.040]   with a tired minority in the middle.
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:16.280]   One segment of the country believes that Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election and that the
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:19.840]   Russians interfered and got Donald Trump into power.
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:22.680]   Another half of the country believes that Donald Trump won the 2020 election.
[02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:26.220]   If you can't agree on who wins elections, it's very hard to see who you, what you agree
[02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:27.840]   on as a country.
[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:32.440]   That's one of the reasons I mind the war on American history and Western history is one
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:36.120]   of the things you have to agree on is at least some attitude towards your past.
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:37.120]   You don't have to go on everything.
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:41.920]   But like the public square has to have public heroes who are agreed to be heroes to some
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:45.460]   extent, warts and all.
[02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:49.760]   If you don't have that, if actually you think for instance like half the country thinks
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:55.000]   founding fathers were pretty good, the other half thinks they were absolutely rotten, racist
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:56.000]   and so on.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.720]   If half the country basically thinks it would have been better if Columbus had taken a different
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:05.360]   turn, never found America, gone back home and said, "I don't know, nothing out there,"
[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:06.360]   that would have been better.
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:13.680]   And the other half is pretty glad in the end that we've got America.
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:16.720]   You know, you've got to agree on something.
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:20.560]   And I just see in America, so I do think we've got to try to find things to agree on, like
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:23.240]   a reasonable attitude towards the past.
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:24.240]   That's why that matters.
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:29.600]   And again, I stress, I'm not trying to say that everything in the American past was good.
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:33.400]   God knows that wouldn't stand up for a second of scrutiny or self-scrutiny.
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:35.200]   But nor was it all bad.
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:40.760]   This wasn't a country formed in sin and in an eradicable sin.
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:47.680]   It wasn't founded in 1619 in order to make the country wicked and incapable of escaping
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:48.680]   that wickedness.
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:53.020]   You know, these are things that will matter enormously in the years ahead.
[02:15:53.020 --> 02:16:00.280]   Because if you can't agree on anything, including who your heroes are, like the whole thing
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:01.880]   is just one massive division.
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:06.240]   And we'll see what I think we're already seeing, which is people basically going to states
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:09.160]   where it's more like the life they want to live.
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:11.600]   And some people say to me, well, that's okay.
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:16.560]   And the genius of the founding is that it allows for that.
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:22.760]   That's possible, but it's also, it eradicates part of what has been American public life,
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:27.160]   which is the ability to look at each other and discuss face to face.
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:31.440]   And I see things like this bomb placed on America the other week with the Supreme Court
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:37.200]   leak, the draft leak as being just a further example of that.
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:39.720]   I'm very, very worried about it in America.
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:45.000]   And because if America screws up everything, everything else in the world goes.
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:52.600]   - Yeah, there's the degree to which America is still the beacon of these ideas on which
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:59.200]   the country was founded and has been able to live out in better and better forms, sort
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:03.240]   of live out the actual ideals of the founding principles versus like--
[02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:05.160]   - And with the desire to improve.
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:06.160]   - Yeah, constantly.
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:07.840]   - An imperfect union.
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:15.080]   - Yeah, well, as I generally have hope that people want to sort of, in terms of gratitude,
[02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:20.920]   people are aware of how good it feels to be grateful.
[02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:22.520]   It's a better life psychologically.
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:26.000]   The resentment is a thing that destroys you from within.
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.920]   So I just feel that people will long for that and will find that.
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:33.760]   That's the American way.
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:39.000]   Some of the division that we reveal now has to do with new technologies like social media
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:45.440]   that kind of is a small kind of deviation from the path we're on because it's a new,
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:48.000]   we got a new toy, just like nuclear weapons.
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:51.160]   - Yeah, which are relatively new.
[02:17:51.160 --> 02:17:54.560]   But we need to find reasonable attitudes towards these things.
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:18:00.480]   And that's why I say like it matters how you imbibe feedback on social media because we're
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:02.120]   all going through it to some extent.
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:03.120]   - We're learning.
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:04.120]   - And we're learning.
[02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:08.520]   And we've got to learn how to do this without going mad.
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:15.440]   I say this as my minimalist call to friends in this era was the main job is not to go
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:16.440]   insane.
[02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:17.440]   - Yeah.
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:18.440]   Yeah.
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:24.360]   And yeah, like walk towards sanity.
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:29.080]   Because I'm sure there's a Hunter S. Thompson quote in there, like insanity on the weekends
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:30.320]   can be at least fun.
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:38.640]   Okay, do you have advice for young people that just put down their TikTok and are listening
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:43.520]   to this podcast in high school and college about how to have a career, how to have a
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:45.400]   life they can be proud of?
[02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:52.320]   - It's a very broad question, but of course, I mean, I can give specific advice for people
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:56.760]   who want to be writers and so on, but that's a bit niche maybe.
[02:18:56.760 --> 02:18:59.000]   - Writers will be very interesting, sorry to interrupt.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.520]   Also how to put your ideas down on paper and think that the ideas develop them and have
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:09.680]   the guts to go to a large audience, especially when the ideas are sort of controversial or
[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:10.680]   dangerous or difficult.
[02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:13.440]   - Well, the main thing to do is to read.
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:18.880]   When I was a schoolboy, I'd ever have a book in my pocket, a side pocket of my jacket or
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:23.560]   any side pocket and would read.
[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:30.320]   That wasn't just because I was swattish in some way, but because I discovered, probably
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:32.760]   at some point in my early teens, I discovered something.
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:34.680]   I read about this once.
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:44.480]   I discovered that books were dangerous, which was a thrilling discovery.
[02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:49.680]   I discovered that they could contain anything and also people didn't know what you were
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:50.680]   reading.
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:57.320]   I remember I got far too young an age, I read "The Doors of Perception" of Aldous Huxley
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:03.600]   and I didn't make head or tail of it probably, but I knew that it was about something really
[02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:07.280]   interesting and dangerous.
[02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:16.280]   I thought constantly when I read poetry or read history, I was just constantly thrilled
[02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:21.540]   and wanted to know more.
[02:20:21.540 --> 02:20:26.460]   If you want to become a writer, you have to be a reader.
[02:20:26.460 --> 02:20:28.640]   You have to read the best stuff.
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:35.760]   Obviously, people disagree or agree on what that is and you'll find the people that really
[02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:37.600]   impress you.
[02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:46.440]   But I know that I just came across certain writers who just knocked me off my feet.
[02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:52.940]   When you find those people, read everything and cling on to them and find other people
[02:20:52.940 --> 02:20:59.800]   like that, find other writers like that, people who are connected by history or scholarship
[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:01.720]   or circles or whatever.
[02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:04.040]   For you, was it fiction or nonfiction?
[02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:07.720]   Was there particular books that you just remember or just give you pause?
[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:13.160]   Well, I remember that the first book that absolutely threw me was "The Lord of the Flies"
[02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:16.960]   of William Golding, which used to be a signed text and everyone's a bit snotty about because
[02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:19.960]   it's so popular.
[02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:24.960]   But I was thrown because I think it was the first adult book I read in that I had been
[02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:30.840]   used to the world of children's literature of everything ends up fine in the end, the
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:34.320]   lost all get found.
[02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:39.720]   This was the first book I read where that's not the case, where the world turns out differently.
[02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:46.000]   I remember for days afterwards, I was just in a state of shock.
[02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:53.360]   I couldn't believe what I'd just discovered and partly because I sort of intuited it must
[02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:54.360]   be true.
[02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:59.760]   Of course, that is not to say that "The Lord of the Flies" has lots of scholarship on what
[02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:04.640]   children do in the situation of being on the island when they do congregate.
[02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:09.000]   But yes, that was a sort of introduction to the adult world and it was shocking and thrilling
[02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:12.200]   and I wanted more of it.
[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:14.760]   It was dangerous.
[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:16.480]   It was dangerous.
[02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:22.120]   And then of course, when I became interested in sex, let alone when I was gay, I read books
[02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:25.920]   were a very, very good way to learn about what I was.
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:33.760]   And that was even more dangerous in a way and I thought, "Nobody knows what I know."
[02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:34.760]   - You discovered sex?
[02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:36.160]   That was an invention in books?
[02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:37.160]   What do you mean?
[02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:42.080]   - No, what I mean is that one of the things that gay people have when they're growing
[02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:47.200]   up is that you have this terribly big secret and you don't think the world will ever know.
[02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:49.840]   You hope the world will never know.
[02:22:49.840 --> 02:22:56.560]   And it's been called by one psychologist, "The little boy with the big secret."
[02:22:56.560 --> 02:23:03.480]   And so if you discover that other people have the same secret, there's a sort of, "Thank
[02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:06.100]   God for that."
[02:23:06.100 --> 02:23:09.520]   But I mean, that's just a version of what everybody gets in reading in a way, which
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:15.320]   is the thrill of discovery that somebody else thought something you thought only you'd thought.
[02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:20.480]   I mean, one of the greatest thrills in all of literature is when a voice comes from across
[02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:24.840]   the centuries and seems to leave a handprint.
[02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:29.080]   - It makes you feel a little bit less alone because somebody else feels, sees the world
[02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:30.960]   the same way, is the same way.
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:37.900]   - That's what C.S. Lewis said, "We read to know we're not alone."
[02:23:37.900 --> 02:23:42.720]   But we don't only read to know we're not alone, we read to become other people.
[02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:46.640]   I mean, I think I saw in books a version of the life I wanted to live, and then I decided
[02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:48.320]   to live it.
[02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:52.800]   And I'm fortunate enough to have done so.
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:58.320]   I wanted to live in the world of ideas and books and debate.
[02:23:58.320 --> 02:24:01.960]   I wanted to live in the debates of my time.
[02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:06.840]   And I remember when, like a lot of people, I read Auden when I was young.
[02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:09.840]   And certain lines obviously stuck with me.
[02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:17.960]   But that poem of his, which everybody knows and which he hated, September 1st, 1939, I
[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:21.440]   remember certain lines in that just whacked me.
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:23.280]   What's that one?
[02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:30.400]   Sitting on a dive, for a second, as we degrade and alone at the end of a low, dishonest decade.
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:34.160]   But of course, there's a problem with that line, which is you kind of want to be living
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:36.600]   at the end of a low, dishonest decade as well.
[02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:39.200]   It sounds sort of cool in a way.
[02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:41.400]   You're the only person who sees it.
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:43.560]   But so yeah, anyhow, there's a diversion.
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:47.640]   But the point is, if you want to be a writer, you've got to be a reader.
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:52.960]   And apart from anything else, you discover the lilt of language and the things you can
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:53.960]   do.
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:25:00.180]   And I've read people who, and I still do, who I think, my God, how did you do that?
[02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:04.340]   In fact, books for me now, and articles and other things, fall into two categories.
[02:25:04.340 --> 02:25:07.400]   One is I know how you did that.
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:10.640]   And the other is I don't know how you did that.
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:17.400]   And the best feeling as a writer is when you do the second one.
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:19.560]   And it happens occasionally in my writing life.
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:22.760]   - We almost like return to something you've written, or like right after you write it.
[02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:24.040]   - No, the moment you write it.
[02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:26.240]   - You wonder, how did I do that?
[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:27.240]   - Yes.
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:32.800]   That's the most, I've never said that before, that's the happiest thing in writing.
[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:37.800]   Very occasionally, this sounds, but I mean, I've occasionally finished something.
[02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:44.520]   Funny enough, it happened some years ago in a long piece I wrote about the artist Basquiat.
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:47.880]   I finished the piece and I gasped.
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:54.640]   I didn't know, because that's also a thing with writing is you, it's not, sometimes people
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:56.440]   say you need to write in order to know what you think.
[02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:58.560]   That's not quite true.
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:03.400]   And that's a very bad piece of advice for some writers who don't know what they think
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:10.560]   and it's not going to become clearer if they just start typing.
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:16.880]   Sometimes it is true that you, there's a thought that's just waiting there and a clarity that
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:20.780]   comes across and suddenly the sentence emerges in your brain.
[02:26:20.780 --> 02:26:25.760]   And by the time you typed it, you just go, yes.
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:27.480]   That's the greatest feeling as a writer.
[02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:30.040]   It's like it came from somewhere else.
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:36.440]   - That's what Bakunin says about what's the moment, it's Tom Stoppard's favorite quote
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:42.240]   about Bakunin saying what happens in the moment where the writer's pen, when he pauses, where
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:45.120]   does he go in that moment?
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:50.000]   - Yeah, that's so interesting.
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.680]   'Cause I think the answer to that question will help us explain consciousness and all
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:58.280]   those other weird things about the human mind.
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:26:59.640]   So that was advice for writers.
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:03.720]   I didn't really give any advice to people in general.
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:06.320]   - You want to give health advice to Churchill?
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:09.840]   - No, I don't want to give health advice.
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:15.320]   - Clearly, because you implied that Churchill was one of your early guides in that aspect.
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:21.760]   So when you discovered your sexuality, let me ask about love.
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:30.640]   Far too personal of a question to ask a Brit, but what was that like, and broadly speaking,
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:35.440]   what's the role of love in the human condition?
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:37.160]   Sex and love.
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:42.400]   And for you personally, discovering that you were, and maybe telling the world that you
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:44.960]   were gay.
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:47.640]   - I'm very perilously personal.
[02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:51.680]   I do actually have a sort of rule that I don't talk about in my personal life.
[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:52.680]   Rules are meant to be broken.
[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:57.360]   - Okay, well I'll break it a little bit.
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:01.160]   One of the ways in which growing up and realizing you're gay differs from growing up and being
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:08.160]   straight is that it's almost inevitable that your first passions will be unrequited.
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:13.600]   - Oh wow, I never thought about that, yeah.
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:18.800]   - Now that's not to say, I mean, there's plenty of unrequited love among young men for young
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:21.840]   women, young women for young men, plenty of that.
[02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:30.200]   But it's almost inevitable if you're gay that your first passions will be totally unrequited.
[02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:33.800]   Because the odds are that the person in question will not be gay.
[02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:37.600]   - So the experience of love is mostly heartbreak.
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:40.880]   - Is heartbreak and disappointment.
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:43.360]   - Heartbreak can be beautiful too, formative.
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:46.760]   - Well again, it comes back to the thing of if you're a writer or something, because you
[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:49.040]   can always do something with it.
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:53.840]   That's why all writers are sort of not to be trusted.
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:56.560]   - I didn't trust you the moment you walked in here.
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:29:04.200]   - No, I mean, it's a famous problem with writers, because you always think, well I could use
[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:05.200]   that.
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:08.360]   It's a dangerous thing and all writers should be aware of it.
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:10.240]   - It's almost like a drug, right?
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:12.280]   - No, it's not like a drug.
[02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:20.240]   It's the fear that all things, even the greatest suffering, could be material.
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:22.560]   - What's the danger in that exactly?
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:27.080]   That seeing the material in the human experience, you don't experience it fully?
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:30.760]   - You don't experience it fully and you might be using it.
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:35.280]   I had a friend who wrote a poem about a friend who died in a motorcycle accident in Sydney
[02:29:35.280 --> 02:29:36.640]   in the 60s.
[02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:40.040]   And he said he knew at the moment he was told that his friend's death, a tiny bit of him
[02:29:40.040 --> 02:29:42.320]   thought I could use this for a poem.
[02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:45.520]   And he did and the poem was wonderful, but there's always that slight guilt for writers
[02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:47.800]   of, am I going to use that?
[02:29:47.800 --> 02:29:50.200]   Anyhow, that's a divergence.
[02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:52.880]   - Life is full of guilty pleasures and I think that's one of them.
[02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:57.960]   Because if you feel that guilt, really what you're doing is you're capturing that moment
[02:29:57.960 --> 02:30:02.880]   and you're going to impact the lives of many, many people by writing about that moment,
[02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:06.600]   because it's going to stimulate something that resonates with those people, because
[02:30:06.600 --> 02:30:11.000]   they had similar kinds of memories about a loss and a passion towards somebody that they
[02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:12.000]   had to lose.
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:15.840]   So don't, you know, but there's a good sign perhaps.
[02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:21.960]   - More obvious perhaps problem is reporting from war zones or bad places and wanting to
[02:30:21.960 --> 02:30:25.000]   find bad stories because it's useful.
[02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:28.280]   And there is a definite guilt you get from that sort of thing.
[02:30:28.280 --> 02:30:31.360]   Like the worse the situation, the more useful.
[02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:32.360]   Anyhow.
[02:30:33.120 --> 02:30:36.640]   No, so that's sort of the only difference that happens from growing up being gay.
[02:30:36.640 --> 02:30:44.920]   And it means that most, certainly in my generation, most gay men came to sexual or romantic maturity
[02:30:44.920 --> 02:30:46.240]   later.
[02:30:46.240 --> 02:30:52.640]   And there's lots of explanations of that maybe being one of the reasons for perceived or
[02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:57.360]   otherwise promiscuity among gay men, which is I think more easily persuaded by the fact
[02:30:57.360 --> 02:31:04.680]   that gay men behave like men would if women were men.
[02:31:04.680 --> 02:31:11.080]   - That's one explanation, but it's both a feature and a bug that you come to sexual
[02:31:11.080 --> 02:31:12.840]   flourishing later in life.
[02:31:12.840 --> 02:31:17.720]   That could be seen as a, in the trajectory of human life, that could be a positive or
[02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:18.720]   a negative.
[02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:19.720]   - Yeah.
[02:31:19.720 --> 02:31:24.920]   - But what's broadly speaking is the role of love in the human condition, Douglas.
[02:31:24.920 --> 02:31:30.440]   - Well, it's the nearest thing we have to finding the point.
[02:31:30.440 --> 02:31:31.440]   - What is the point?
[02:31:31.440 --> 02:31:32.480]   What's the meaning of life?
[02:31:32.480 --> 02:31:33.480]   Let's go there.
[02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:36.400]   - So what's the meaning is a hard one, of course.
[02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:40.760]   Where is the meaning is slightly easier.
[02:31:40.760 --> 02:31:43.800]   And I'd say that everyone can find that.
[02:31:43.800 --> 02:31:47.120]   You gravitate towards the places you find meaning.
[02:31:47.120 --> 02:31:49.560]   Now there's a conservative answer to this, which is quite useful.
[02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:53.480]   And it's certainly more useful than any others because the conservative answer is find meaning
[02:31:53.480 --> 02:31:59.800]   where people have found it before, which is a very, very good answer.
[02:31:59.800 --> 02:32:05.120]   If your ancestors have found meaning in a place of worship or a particular canon of
[02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:16.680]   work, go there because it's been proven by time to be able to give you the goods.
[02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:24.720]   Much more sensible than saying, "Hey, I don't know, discover new ways of meaning."
[02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:37.000]   But love is probably the nearest thing we can have to the divine on earth.
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:43.840]   And of course, the problem of what exactly, what type of love we mean is an issue.
[02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:47.840]   - But that goes to the fact that you don't like definitions anyway.
[02:32:47.840 --> 02:32:51.320]   - I do like definitions, I just think they need to be pinned down.
[02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:57.680]   But let's not go there at the moment because it's...
[02:32:57.680 --> 02:32:59.720]   - That's not pinned down love at the moment?
[02:32:59.720 --> 02:33:03.480]   - Well, no, because as you know, I mean, because of the different varieties of love and the
[02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:06.840]   fact that we have one word for it in our culture and that it means an awful lot of things and
[02:33:06.840 --> 02:33:09.400]   we don't delineate it well.
[02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:22.240]   But let's say human love with the greatest fulfillment in sexual love with another person
[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:31.800]   is probably the greatest intimation you can have of what might otherwise only be superseded
[02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:35.200]   by divine love.
[02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:43.600]   And it's the sense that all young lovers have, which is that they've just walked through
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:47.440]   the low door in the garden and found themselves in bliss.
[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:56.240]   And that this is, there's a beautiful, beautiful poem of, can I read it to you?
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:33:57.240]   - Yes, please.
[02:33:57.240 --> 02:33:58.840]   - I'll try to find it.
[02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:07.360]   There's a beautiful poem of Philip Larkin's, which slightly says what I'm, I'm trying not
[02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:10.680]   to duck your question by referring to other people, but...
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:13.320]   - Maybe that's the best way to answer the question.
[02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:14.320]   - Could be.
[02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:16.840]   - Is to read a poem.
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:26.860]   - So there's a poem by Philip Larkin called High Windows, which is remarkable because
[02:34:26.860 --> 02:34:37.360]   he came to sexual, he had a rather unhappy sex life, but he came to sexual fruition in
[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:41.720]   the 40s and 50s and all the hell that that involved.
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:49.840]   And he took what I regard as being a really remarkable and important view on the sexual
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:53.320]   revolution in the 60s, which is that most people of his generation, most older people
[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:59.760]   resented the young, they resented the freedom they had, and actually they pretended the
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:02.000]   freedom was terrible and it was always getting lightly done.
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:05.400]   And Philip Larkin, rather surprisingly, he was a very conservative person, took a different
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:10.400]   view and he says it in this poem, and the opening of the poem is, he says, "When I see
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:16.920]   a couple of kids and guess who's fucking her and she's taking pills or wearing a diaphragm,
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:23.640]   I know this is paradise, everyone old has dreamed of all their lives, bonds and gestures
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:30.280]   pushed to one side like an outdated combine harvester, and everyone young going down the
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:34.480]   long slide to happiness endlessly.
[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:41.320]   I wonder if anyone looked at me 40 years back and thought, that'll be the life, no God anymore,
[02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:47.080]   sweating in the dark about hell and that, or having to hide what you think of the priest,
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:52.920]   he and his lot will all go down the long slide like free bloody birds.
[02:35:52.920 --> 02:36:00.000]   And immediately, rather than words, comes the thought of high windows, the sun comprehending
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:09.680]   glass and beyond it the deep blue air that shows nothing and is nowhere and is endless."
[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:12.880]   The divine, he found it.
[02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:18.480]   He found it in seeing a couple of young kids and knowing that one of them was wearing a
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:19.480]   diaphragm.
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:21.240]   Do you see what I mean?
[02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:25.280]   First of all, it's very counterintuitive, but secondly, there's the point that sex had
[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:29.400]   been so tied up with misery.
[02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:32.920]   I mean, people don't remember this now when they talk about the past.
[02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:38.040]   I mean, one of my favorite books, Stefan Zweig's The World of Yesterday, descriptions of what
[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:42.560]   it was like trying to have sex in pre-First World War Vienna.
[02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:46.280]   All the men ended up going to female prostitutes.
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:49.680]   So many of them got syphilis and this was their first experience of sex.
[02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:54.880]   It was so goddamn awful and they were stuck with it all their lives.
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:59.600]   There's lots of stuff that's gone better in our last century and that's one of them.
[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:05.880]   But you ask about love, yes, I do think that love is basically the thing that gives us
[02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:08.200]   the best glimpse of the divine.
[02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:15.640]   - And by the way, sex, liberating sex, doesn't buy you love either.
[02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:16.640]   - No.
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:24.640]   I mean, it throws in an entirely, it threw in another set of problems.
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:30.640]   - If there's any meaning on top of all of that is we like to find problems and solve
[02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:36.760]   that as a human species and sometimes we even create problems.
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:42.400]   Douglas, thank you for highlighting all the problems of human civilization and giving
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:44.400]   us a glimmer of hope for the future.
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:45.400]   This is an incredible conversation.
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:46.400]   Thank you for talking today.
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:47.400]   It's a huge honor.
[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:48.400]   Thank you.
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:49.400]   - It was very kind of you to say that.
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:50.400]   Thank you.
[02:37:50.400 --> 02:37:53.880]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Douglas Murray.

[02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:02.640]   And now let me leave you with some words from Douglas Murray himself.
[02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:06.040]   Disagreement is not oppression.
[02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:08.040]   Argument is not assault.
[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:14.140]   Words, even provocative and repugnant ones, are not violence.
[02:38:14.140 --> 02:38:19.280]   The answer to speech we do not like is more speech.
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:20.280]   Thank you for listening.
[02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:21.400]   I hope to see you next time.
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:22.400]   Bye.
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:22.400]   - Bye.
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:23.400]   - Bye.
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:28.400]   - Bye.
