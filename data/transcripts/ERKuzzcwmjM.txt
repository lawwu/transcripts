[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.760]   - What's the deepest longing of the human heart?
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.900]   What's your deepest desire?
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.020]   What's the thing you want most?
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.580]   There's an answer to that question
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.260]   and it's the focus of today's episode.
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.980]   During the month of December leading up to Christmas,
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.380]   I wanna do something we've never done before.
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.140]   I've convinced Pastor John to read a few chapters
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.020]   from his excellent book, "Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ."
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.580]   I love that little book and this is my nudge
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.060]   to see if Pastor John will read the whole thing
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.000]   as his first audio book.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.380]   To that end, he recorded one chapter for us,
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.980]   for you, the APJ audience.
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.820]   You're hearing it for the very first time.
[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.100]   So here now is Pastor John reading chapter one
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.900]   from his wonderful book, "Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ,"
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.860]   a chapter that answers the question,
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.680]   what is the deepest longing of my heart?
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.500]   - The heavens declare the glory of God.
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.040]   Psalm 19, one.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.940]   God, who said, "Light shall shine out of darkness,"
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.540]   has shown in our hearts to give the light
[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.300]   of the knowledge of the glory of God
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.900]   in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.040]   Second Corinthians 4, six.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.780]   Chapter one, "Seeing and Savoring the Glory of God,"
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.100]   the ultimate aim of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.780]   The created universe is all about glory.
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.840]   The deepest longing of the human heart
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.300]   and the deepest meaning of heaven and earth
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.140]   are summed up in this, the glory of God.
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.100]   The universe was made to show it
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.160]   and we were made to see it and savor it.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.340]   Nothing less will do,
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.480]   which is why the world is as disordered
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.920]   and as dysfunctional as it is.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.920]   We have exchanged the glory of God for other things.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.300]   Romans 1, 23.
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.300]   "The heavens declare the glory of God," Psalm 19, one.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.800]   That is why all the universe exists.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.200]   It's all about glory.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.780]   The Hubble Space Telescope
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.120]   sends back infrared images of faint galaxies,
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.060]   perhaps 12 billion light years away,
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.100]   12 billion times six trillion miles.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.420]   Even within our Milky Way,
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.620]   there are stars so great as to defy description,
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.620]   like Eta Carinae,
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.340]   which is five million times brighter than our sun.
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.740]   Sometimes people stumble over this vastness
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.900]   in relation to the apparent insignificance of man.
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.140]   It does seem to make us infinitesimally small,
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.500]   but the meaning of this magnitude is not mainly about us.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.340]   It's about God.
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.140]   "The heavens declare the glory of God," says the Scripture.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.140]   The reason for wasting so much space on a universe
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.700]   to house a speck of humanity
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.460]   is to make a point about our maker, not us.
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.860]   Lift up your eyes on high and see who created these stars.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.340]   He who brings out their host by number,
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.740]   calling them all by name,
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.100]   by the greatness of his might,
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.780]   and because he is strong in power,
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.140]   not one of them is missing.
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.460]   Isaiah 40, 26.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.500]   "The deepest longing of the human heart
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.580]   "is to know and enjoy the glory of God.
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.820]   "We were made for this.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.460]   "Bring my sons from afar
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.700]   "and my daughters from the end of the earth,
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.140]   "whom I created for my glory," says the Lord.
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.100]   Isaiah 43, 6 and 7.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.740]   "To see it, to savor it, and to show it.
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.620]   "That is why we exist.
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.180]   "The untracked, unimaginable stretches
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.100]   "of the created universe are a parable
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.700]   "about the inexhaustible riches of his glory."
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.660]   Romans 9, 23.
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.660]   "The physical eye is meant to say to the spiritual eye,
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.820]   "'Not this, but the maker of this
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.540]   "'is the desire of your soul.'"
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.540]   St. Paul said, "We rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.660]   Romans 5, 2.
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.740]   Or even more precisely,
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.220]   he said that we were prepared beforehand for glory.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.220]   Romans 9, 23.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.020]   "This is why we were created,
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.380]   "that he might make known the riches of his glory
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.260]   "for vessels of mercy."
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.060]   Romans 9, 23.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.060]   "The ache of every human heart is an ache for this,
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.460]   "but we suppress it and do not see fit
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.100]   "to have God in our knowledge."
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.660]   Romans 1, 28.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.660]   "Therefore, the entire creation has fallen into disorder."
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.220]   The most prominent example of this in the Bible
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.240]   is the disordering of our sexual lives.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.060]   Paul says that the exchange of the glory of God
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.740]   for other things is the root cause
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.340]   for the homosexual and heterosexual disordering
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.500]   of our relationships.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.740]   Their women exchanged natural relations
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.500]   for those that are contrary to nature.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.140]   The men likewise gave up natural relations with women
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.860]   and were consumed with passion for one another.
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.700]   Romans 1, 26 and 27.
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.340]   "If we exchange God's glory for lesser things,
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.180]   "he gives us up to lived out parables of depravity,
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.660]   "the other exchanges that mirror in our misery
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.980]   "the ultimate sellout."
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.160]   The point is this.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.580]   We were made to know and treasure the glory of God.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.620]   Above all things.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.380]   And when we trade that treasure for images,
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.260]   everything is disordered.
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.500]   The sun of God's glory was made to shine
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.060]   at the center of the solar system of our soul.
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.660]   And when it does, all the planets of our life
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.060]   are held in their proper orbit.
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.060]   But when the sun is displaced, everything flies apart.
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.020]   The healing of the soul begins
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.260]   by restoring the glory of God to its flaming,
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.240]   all attracting place at the center.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.240]   We are all starved for the glory of God, not self.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:00.280]   No one goes to the Grand Canyon to increase self-esteem.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.860]   Why do we go?
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.840]   Because there is greater healing for the soul
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.840]   in beholding splendor than there is in beholding self.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.400]   Indeed, what could be more ludicrous
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.700]   in a vast and glorious universe like this
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.020]   than a human being on the speck called Earth,
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.940]   standing in front of a mirror,
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.940]   trying to find significance in his own self image.
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.240]   It is a great sadness
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.660]   that this is the gospel of the modern world.
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.840]   But it is not the Christian gospel.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.840]   Into the darkness of petty self-preoccupation
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.020]   has shown the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ,
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:54.420]   who is the image of God, 2 Corinthians 4.4.
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.220]   The Christian gospel is about the glory of Christ,
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.100]   not about me.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.140]   And when it is in some measure about me,
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.420]   it is not about my being made much of by God,
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.720]   but about God mercifully enabling me to enjoy
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.240]   making much of him forever.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:20.420]   What was the most loving thing Jesus could do for us?
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.620]   What was the endpoint, the highest good of the gospel?
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:31.100]   Redemption, forgiveness, justification,
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:36.260]   reconciliation, sanctification, adoption,
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.380]   are not all of these great wonders
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.520]   simply means to something greater,
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.580]   something final,
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.080]   something that Jesus asked his father to give us.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:56.100]   Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:02.020]   may be with me where I am to see my glory
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.820]   that you have given me, John 17.24.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:13.040]   The Christian gospel is the gospel of the glory of Christ
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.140]   because its final aim is that we would see and savor
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:23.540]   and show the glory of Christ.
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:28.540]   For this is none other than the glory of God.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.640]   He is the radiance of the glory of God
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.140]   and the exact imprint of his nature, Hebrews 1.3.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.940]   He is the image of the invisible God, Colossians 1.15.
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.020]   When the light of the gospel shines in our hearts,
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.060]   it is the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.900]   in the face of Jesus Christ, 2 Corinthians 4.6.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.900]   And when we rejoice in hope of the glory of God,
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.900]   Romans 5.2, that hope is our blessed hope,
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.900]   the appearing of the glory of our great God
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.900]   and savior, Jesus Christ, Titus 2.13.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:17.020]   The glory of Christ is the glory of God.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.300]   In one sense, Christ laid the glory of God aside
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.240]   when he came.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.600]   And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.500]   with the glory that I had with you
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.960]   before the world existed, John 17.5.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:39.820]   But in another sense, Christ manifested the glory of God
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.740]   in his coming.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.420]   The word became flesh and dwelt among us,
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.580]   and we have seen his glory,
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.380]   glory as of the only Son from the Father,
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.860]   full of grace and truth, John 1.14.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:58.860]   Therefore, in the gospel, we see and savor
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:05.100]   the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.380]   2 Corinthians 4.6.
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.740]   And this kind of seeing is the healing
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.340]   of our disordered lives.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.860]   We all, with unveiled face,
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.140]   beholding the glory of the Lord,
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.020]   are being transformed into the same image
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.960]   from one degree of glory to another, 2 Corinthians 3.18.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.840]   A prayer.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.660]   O Father of glory, this is the cry of our hearts,
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:40.900]   to be changed from one degree of glory to another
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.000]   until in the resurrection, at the last trumpet,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.740]   we are completely conformed to the image of your Son,
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.900]   Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.700]   Until then, we long to grow in grace
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.180]   and in the knowledge of our Lord,
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.060]   especially the knowledge of his glory.
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.420]   We want to see it as clearly as we see the Son
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.320]   and to savor it as deeply as our most desired pleasure.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.620]   O merciful Father, incline our hearts to your word
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.660]   and the wonders of your glory.
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:18.420]   Wean us off our obsession with trivial things.
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.840]   Open the eyes of our hearts to see each day
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.300]   what the created universe is telling us about your glory.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.900]   Enlighten our minds to see the glory of your Son
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.820]   in the gospel.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.400]   We believe that you are the all-glorious one
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.780]   and that there is none like you.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.860]   Help our unbelief.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.100]   Forgive the wandering of our affections
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.120]   and the undue attention we give to lesser things.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.860]   Have mercy on us for Christ's sake
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.300]   and fulfill in us your great design
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.960]   to display the glory of your grace.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.160]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.140]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.980]   Wean us from our obsession with trivial things.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.560]   A daily prayer that I need.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.420]   That is chapter one from Pastor John's book,
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.220]   "Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ."
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.220]   And wherever you're listening in the midst of your day,
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.240]   thanks for joining us.

[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.380]   Next up, a missions question.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.620]   Pastor John is in the studio.
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.560]   I'll ask him if the nations will be reached
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.900]   before Christ returns or after he returns
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.020]   and how does Revelation 14, six fit into the mix?
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.860]   It's a good question.
[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.420]   Up next time, I'm your host Tony Reinhke.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.620]   We'll see you on Friday.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:59.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
