[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.720]   - Welcome everyone to the 50th edition
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.080]   of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.180]   Today, our special guest is Craig Lazera.
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.860]   Craig is the Managing Director
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.600]   in the Core Product Management Group
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.960]   at S&P Dow Jones Indices,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.200]   where his responsibilities focus on providing
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.960]   thought leadership and educational outreach.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.820]   Today, we're gonna be discussing the SPIVA report,
[00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.380]   S&P Index versus Active.
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:44.220]   Hi everyone, my name is Rick Ferry
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.680]   and I'm the host of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.840]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.880]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.100]   Center for Financial Literacy,

[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.960]   coming up this October 12th through the 14th,
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.040]   featuring many speakers that I've had on this podcast
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.880]   and more.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.640]   Today, our special guest is Craig Lazera.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.080]   Craig is the Managing Director
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.640]   in the Core Product Management Group
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.700]   at S&P Dow Jones Indices,
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.840]   where his responsibilities focus on providing
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.920]   thought leadership and educational outreach.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.080]   Today, Craig and I are discussing something
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.540]   near and dear to the Bogleheads' heart,
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.680]   the active versus passive debate.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.600]   Should you only be using index funds
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.500]   or should you be using only active funds
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.440]   or should you be using a mixture
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.920]   of active funds and index funds?
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.780]   There's over a hundred years of data
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.520]   on active management versus index returns.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.600]   And this data has been remarkably consistent
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.400]   through the entire 100 year period of time.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.920]   Today, we're gonna be looking at the last 20 years
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.160]   when S&P has been publishing
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.560]   their detailed index versus active report
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.200]   and a second report which analyzes the persistence
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.560]   of outperforming actively managed mutual funds.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.960]   So with no further ado,
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.640]   let me introduce Craig Lazera.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.760]   Welcome to the Bogleheads on Investing podcast, Craig.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.600]   - Rick, thank you.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.200]   I'm delighted to be here.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.220]   - Craig, we've known each other for a long time
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.220]   and you've been at S&P Dow Jones Indices for a long time.
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.560]   And I wanna get into a little bit of your background
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.160]   as to what brought you there.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.960]   But in order to talk about S&P Dow Jones Indices,
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.780]   I think we need a little explanation
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.520]   of who is S&P Dow Jones Indices
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.840]   and why is it S&P Dow Jones rather than just S&P.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.680]   - Well, as you suggest, Rick,
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.520]   they're originally two different entities.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.240]   S&P, of course, stands for Standard & Poor's
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.780]   and the roots of the Standard & Poor's company
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.040]   go back to the, I think, the 1860s
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.720]   when Henry Varnum Poor published the first railroad ratings.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.960]   And S&P obviously is well known for its ratings business.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.040]   There was a company called Standard Statistics
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.040]   that I believe in 1923 began to publish an index
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.080]   of the U.S. stock market.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.440]   I think it had a relatively small number of names
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.960]   and it was the first capitalization weighted index
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.880]   ever computed on a daily basis.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.280]   And I believe that was 1923.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.420]   Somewhere along the line,
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.060]   the Standard Statistics company
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.480]   and Henry Varnum Poor's ratings company merged.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.600]   That's where it came to be Standard & Poor's.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.800]   And then this initial cap weighted index product
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.840]   that I mentioned, that started in 1923,
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.360]   morphed by, that we added names as,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.260]   or they added names as computing capabilities allowed.
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.840]   But in 1957, I believe in March, 1957,
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.400]   the Standard & Poor's company launched
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.760]   what was called then the Standard & Poor's 500,
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.300]   now the S&P 500.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.300]   And so the history of the 500 goes back to March, 1957.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.080]   And then obviously has come forward from there.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.760]   On the other side of the merger,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.920]   Mr. Dow, Mr. Jones started publishing their iconic indices.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.000]   I think in the 1880s, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.960]   started I believe in 1896,
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.640]   but the transportation average
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.060]   is actually a bit older than that.
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.460]   Those were price weighted,
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.360]   meaning in the days when the only computational equipment
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.440]   you had was a piece of chalk and a blackboard,
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.600]   you could add up the names or the prices of,
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.800]   I think it was a dozen stocks to begin with,
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.720]   and divide by 12 and got your answers.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.480]   So the Dow Company, it'll continue to evolve.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.400]   And obviously as indices and index funds
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.920]   became more important in the investing landscape,
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.420]   both companies developed substantial businesses
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.200]   in licensing indices
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   for the creation of investment products.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   In 2012, what was then called S&P Indices,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.720]   acquired Dow Jones Indexes
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.240]   and formed S&P Dow Jones Indices,
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.720]   which is technically now a joint venture company,
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.600]   about three quarters owned by S&P Global,
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.640]   which is the parent company
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.160]   that evolved out of the old S&P,
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.880]   and one quarter by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.760]   So we've been S&P Dow Jones Indices since 2012.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.960]   It's interesting because both S&P
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.880]   had a total stock market index
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.240]   and Dow Jones had a total stock market index.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.200]   And I think the difference between the two indices,
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.600]   even though they both have 4,200 names,
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.440]   one of them might have 4,201 names
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.360]   and the other one might have 4,200 names.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.600]   I mean, they're so similar.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.120]   But when you're looking at something like
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.080]   the Fidelity Total Stock Market Index
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.200]   or iShare Total Stock Market Index,
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.300]   one of them actually tracks
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.440]   the S&P Total Stock Market Index Fund
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.280]   and the other one tracks
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.480]   the Dow Jones Total Stock Market Index Fund,
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.640]   or the Total Stock Market Index, I should say.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.600]   And they're so very similar.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.600]   - Yeah, no, I remember when we did the merger,
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.400]   I was product manager for our U.S. equity products,
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.560]   which basically means the S&P 500.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.120]   And I remember looking at those very things.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.600]   You graph the S&P Total Market Index
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.440]   and the Dow Total Market Index.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.200]   And if you could put a spec between the graphs,
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.760]   you were lucky.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.560]   I mean, they both include all the stocks
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.880]   you can grab hold of and they're cap-weighted.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   So it's gonna come out to the same thing
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.440]   if you do the numbers correctly.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.920]   - Yeah, on this point, get outside of Dow Jones S&P
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.600]   and let's go to CRISP,
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.360]   which is the indices that Vanguard uses
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.680]   for their total stock market.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.400]   It's a University of Chicago
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.480]   Center for Research and Security prices, CRISP.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.120]   Same thing, I mean, very, very similar tracking.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.000]   Almost all the same stocks,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.520]   maybe entering the index,
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.200]   coming out of the index slightly different,
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.600]   but negligible.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.320]   And then even if you look at the Morningstar
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.840]   Broad Market Index and all of these companies
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.320]   that are creating indices for, say,
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.960]   the total stock market or the broad U.S. market.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.360]   The broad market would be a little bit
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.520]   of a smaller sub-component than the total market,
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.160]   but they're all very similar.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.960]   I mean, the correlation's at 99%
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.280]   and there might be a 0.1% difference in return,
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.280]   but they're all very close.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.560]   That's the history of S&P Dow Jones indices.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.120]   And what about your history?
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.560]   I mean, how did you end up there?
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.680]   - Yeah, well, I went to college at Princeton.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.440]   I majored in what we called then
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.720]   public affairs and economics.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.560]   Went from there to Harvard Business School
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.040]   and graduated in, well, more years ago
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.120]   than I care to admit to, but quite some time ago.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.520]   And did a year with a consulting firm in Boston
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.360]   and then joined an investment management company
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.400]   and have been in the investment management business
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.360]   ever since.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.440]   - And you received your Charter of Financial Analysts
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.560]   charter along the way?
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.040]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.840]   I received the charter in 1983, yes.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.760]   I have a four-digit charter number,
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.040]   which, as you know, Rick, is pretty low.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.360]   - Oh, let me think.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.200]   Do I?
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   No, I don't, I don't, no.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.480]   You're ahead of me. (laughs)
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.280]   And then you went into work in the investment industry.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.960]   - I started my career in the investment business
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.320]   on what we'd call the buy side,
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.720]   as in investment management companies,
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.720]   and spent a number of years at a variety of firms,
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.880]   tending to specialize in what was then considered
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.200]   quantitative analysis.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.680]   I think by today's standards, it wasn't all that advanced,
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.960]   but by 1984 standards, it was pretty good.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.160]   And so I was an equity quant for a while.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.000]   And in the mid '90s, I had the chance to join
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.840]   the old Salomon Brothers brokerage firm,
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.240]   kind of in a job that related to marketing
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.560]   and use of their quantitative research.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.560]   Salomon had started, in 1989, a set of indices
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.880]   that were designed to be float market cap weighted indices
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.280]   of the entire global stock markets.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.480]   I got to know that group.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.320]   They were related.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.440]   I eventually transferred into the department
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.960]   that managed and maintained those indices.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.640]   And those indices were ultimately acquired
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.040]   by Standard & Poor's in 2002, I believe.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.160]   Now, I had left Salomon prior to the acquisition,
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.600]   but luckily I've met a number of people at S&P,
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.240]   and when they were looking for some senior help
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.560]   in 2008, 2009, I was available
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.400]   and were able to make the match.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.160]   So I ended up joining S&P in June of 2009.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.280]   - So now you're at S&P Indices,
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.840]   which became S&P Dow Jones Indices.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.560]   And you and I have been talking for many years
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.320]   about the results of the SPIVA report
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.760]   that was started 20 years ago.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.200]   So let's talk about what SPIVA stands for
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:19.200]   and why this report got started and why it's important.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.920]   Easy question for SPIVA stands for S&P Index Versus Active.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.440]   It's an acronym.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.800]   Sometimes in the UK pronounced SPIVA.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.120]   So take your pick, depending on where our listeners are.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.600]   But the point of SPIVA, then 20 years ago and now,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.960]   is to ask the question,
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.320]   how have actively managed funds performed
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.120]   relative to benchmarks that are appropriate
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.520]   for their investment styles?
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.280]   What I mean by that is if you're trying to evaluate
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.800]   how large-cap US managers have done,
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.600]   you compare them to the S&P 500.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.080]   You want to ask how mid-cap managers have done,
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.640]   you might compare them to the S&P mid-cap 400
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.800]   and compare growth managers to a growth index,
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.640]   value of value index, and so forth.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.920]   But that was the notion that underlay SPIVA in 2002
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.000]   when it was first published.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.240]   And that is the notion that we continue with today.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.560]   - So when you talk about managers,
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.120]   you're talking specifically about mutual funds
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.600]   and exchange-traded funds, correct?
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.960]   - In the case of US SPIVA, yes.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.960]   Really, mutual funds, actively managed mutual funds.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.040]   The data for which we access from a database
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.200]   called the CRISP, you mentioned CRISP earlier,
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.240]   the Center for Research and Security Prices
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.920]   at the University of Chicago.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.200]   CRISP maintains what is called
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:43.040]   a survivorship bias-free database of fundraisers.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.200]   It's a mouthful to say, right?
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.640]   A CRISP survivorship bias-free database.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.320]   In the initial generations of SPIVA,
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.200]   it was focused on mutual funds.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.120]   We've expanded it somewhat institutionally since then.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.040]   You think of it as a mutual fund service initially,
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.440]   and you won't go wrong.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.360]   - Let's talk about the CRISP survivorship bias-free database
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.720]   because it was an important database.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.720]   This didn't exist until 1997 when Mark Carhart,
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:18.240]   who was a University of Chicago Booth School of Business,
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.960]   a PhD student, was doing a study
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.040]   on mutual funds for his thesis,
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:29.040]   and there wasn't any good historic mutual fund database
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.440]   that captured all of the mutual funds going back in history
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.640]   because so many mutual funds have merged
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.520]   or gone out of business.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:43.360]   So what he did with funding from Gene Fama,
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.160]   Nobel Laureate Gene Fama from the University of Chicago,
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.680]   went out as part of his PhD thesis,
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.680]   gathered information on mutual funds going back,
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.480]   as far back as mutual funds existed in the United States,
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.040]   and most of them have gone out of business over time.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.320]   It's included in the database.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.480]   So it is a survivorship bias-free.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   And the idea of survivorship bias,
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.720]   could you explain what that is?
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.000]   In a mutual fund database
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.480]   that doesn't have a survivorship bias-free,
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.320]   what happens with survivorship bias in these databases?
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.720]   - Let's suppose I'm working with a database
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.840]   that is not adjusted for survivorship bias,
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.920]   so it has survivorship bias built in.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.560]   What that means is I'm only able to look at funds
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.160]   that exist today.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.840]   If I want to say, how did these funds perform
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.080]   over the past 10 years, for example, the past 20 years,
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.800]   I'm only looking at the funds
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.960]   that did well enough to survive for 10 or 20 years.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.560]   What you really want to do and what this database does,
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.040]   as you suggest, is I want to be able to go back 20 years
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.960]   and say of all the funds that existed then, how did they do?
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.880]   Because as you pointed out, Rick,
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.840]   a fair number of them do not survive.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.760]   So if you examine only the returns of currently active funds,
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.720]   you're building in a bias
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.440]   because you're only looking at the funds
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.240]   that were most successful, or to be precise,
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.320]   that were successful enough to survive.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.480]   And we know very well that there are many funds
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.040]   that are not successful enough to survive.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:24.000]   And since you didn't know which ones those were 20 years ago,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.840]   the only fair way to do an evaluation
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.080]   is to use a survivorship bias adjusted database
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.320]   to go back 20 years
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.120]   and see what the fund landscape was like then.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.400]   And in your SPIVA report, you have all this information
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.200]   for all the different categories of how much,
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.840]   over one, three, five, 15, 20 year period of time,
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.000]   how many of these funds survived or changed styles.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.600]   That's another thing that you look at as well.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.080]   Some funds that say that their large cap growth
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.880]   end up being something else,
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.600]   or maybe they start out as mid-cap core,
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.280]   end up becoming something else.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.360]   So you also track a style survivorship.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.920]   Yeah, and that's important.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.880]   You might have a fund, let's say a successful fund,
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.160]   starts out as a mid-cap growth fund.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.080]   It's successful.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.680]   It begins to acquire assets.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.520]   And the manager thinks,
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.040]   "Well, if I'm gonna continue to be a mid-cap growth fund,
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.200]   "I've gotta stop taking assets,
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.080]   "or else maybe I should migrate up the cap scale
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.560]   "and use larger stocks,
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.400]   "which then I'm able to deploy the liquidity
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.160]   "that I now have access to."
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.000]   So yeah, that's a natural sort of thing to happen,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.520]   can happen organically as funds grow,
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.560]   or as managers change.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.960]   You know, manager tenure is limited in most of these places.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.480]   So things change.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.640]   So you looked at all of this.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.200]   I mean, you were very unbiased.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.080]   That's how you tried to do it.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.080]   You had to do it as fair as you possibly could
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.360]   to try to say, "Okay, let's take these funds
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.280]   "and compare them to this indice.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.920]   "And let's see how many survived,
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.320]   "how many were style consistent,
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:04.240]   "and how many outperformed the index,
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.280]   "and how many underperformed."
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.960]   And here, the data gets interesting
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.280]   because it is so consistent,
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.800]   not only over the last 20 years,
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.600]   but I've done a lot of work on this.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.560]   It goes back 100 years, how consistent this data is.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.000]   So why don't you tell us.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.360]   >> Yeah, the quickest way to answer your question,
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.960]   I think the adequate answer, a good answer is,
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.560]   what the data show is that most active managers
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.600]   underperform most of the time.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:37.080]   So if you look for the less of the last 20 years of SPIVA
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.920]   for the large cap US manager category,
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.680]   which is the largest category, that's why I picked that one.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.680]   If you compare those managers to the S&P 500 year by year,
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:55.200]   I think the average is something like 64%,
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.200]   in the average year, 64% of the large cap US managers
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.040]   underperform the S&P 500.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.080]   Now, some years it's more, some years it's less.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:10.080]   The last year in which a majority of large cap managers
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.880]   outperformed the S&P 500 was 2009.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.080]   In the 20 years of history of SPIVA,
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.240]   I think there were only three years
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.800]   when a majority outperformed.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.800]   So the result is, you know, suggests,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.960]   and you, Rick, you alluded to all the research
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.560]   that goes back, you know, 100 years,
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.000]   and, you know, a lot of research was published on this topic
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.960]   before index funds started in the '60s and '70s.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.760]   It's a very consistent finding
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.360]   that most active managers underperform a benchmark
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.880]   that is appropriate to their investment style.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.400]   - Now, one of the things that occurs
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   is that because less than 50% outperform,
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.560]   that over time, this compounds.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.080]   So by the time you get out to, say, five years,
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.920]   it's more than 65%.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.760]   - Exactly right.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.760]   In fact, we just released in early September
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.480]   our mid-year SPIVA.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.160]   So it covers the first six months of 2022.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.880]   So for the, and it was a relatively good six-month period.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.600]   Only, you know, 51% of the large cap managers underperformed.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.600]   And that's really quite good,
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.440]   considering the history I mentioned to you.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.440]   Going back a full year, so the year ended June 30th, 2022,
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.200]   55% of large cap managers underperformed.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.720]   Going back five years, 84% underperformed.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.840]   Going back 20 years, 95% underperformed.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.640]   So, and this is, again, very, very common.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.080]   Whatever you look at SPIVA data,
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.080]   you see that the percentage of underperformers goes up
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.160]   as the time horizon extends back.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.760]   You see the same thing if you look at mid-cap managers
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.600]   or small-cap managers or growth specialists
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.440]   or value specialists.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.680]   Very common effect.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.280]   - So this is important for investors
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.480]   who are long-term investors.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.360]   I mean, if you're gonna pick an active fund,
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.560]   the longer you hold it,
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.640]   the lower the probability it'll outperform the indice.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.800]   - Yeah.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.360]   - So if you're gonna be a long-term investor,
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.560]   if you just bought an index fund,
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.800]   the longer you hold it,
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.840]   the higher the probability that index fund
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.400]   will outperform the active managers in that category.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.240]   - Absolutely.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.680]   Another way to say that is,
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.800]   if you look, say, at our large-cap US category,
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.080]   where 95% of the funds underperform the S&P 500
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.840]   over the past 20 years,
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.080]   to turn that on its head and say,
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.600]   if you were an investor choosing a large-cap fund
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.160]   20 years ago,
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.840]   the chance that you chose one that did better
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.360]   than the index was one in 20.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.360]   So the odds are really quite overwhelming
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.920]   in the historical data
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.080]   that the longer you're holding period,
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:05.080]   the more likely it is that an active manager underperformed.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.840]   - Well, let's go to the next dimension of this,
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.320]   and that is that small minority that did outperform,
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.360]   that five or 10% that did outperform,
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.480]   they didn't outperform by very much
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.480]   relative to the 90% that underperformed.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.480]   And the reason I say this is because
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.800]   if the payoff for picking a manager that outperformed
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.040]   was like 10% a year excess return,
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.320]   then it might be worth trying to find those 10% managers
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.960]   because the payoff is so great.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.360]   But that's not what happens.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.400]   The payoff, if you actually find one of those 10%,
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.200]   is significantly smaller than the 90% that underperformed,
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.320]   how much they underperformed by.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.720]   So not only is it very difficult to find managers
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.600]   who are gonna outperform,
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.800]   and we'll get into that in a bit,
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.080]   but the payoff for doing it, you're not getting paid.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.200]   - No, exactly.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.120]   I mean, the odds are against you.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.160]   I mean, I think that that's a fair thing to say
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.040]   to an investor who's contemplating,
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.200]   should I invest in an index fund
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.400]   or in an active manager who follows the same style?
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.640]   If you want to invest in an active, that's fine,
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.520]   but realize the odds are against you.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.200]   - So there's a low probability of picking a manager,
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.000]   and then the payoff is low.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.160]   You also, though, look at this and say,
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.400]   well, some of those funds that are not performing well
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.720]   don't have much money in them,
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.720]   so why are we even counting them in this study?
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.600]   So you actually do the study two different ways.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.320]   You do it based on equal weighting all of the funds,
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.040]   as though all these active funds
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.000]   have the same amount of money in them.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.800]   And then you do cap weighting,
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.520]   which is, okay, let's look at the funds
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.760]   and see how much money there is actually in there
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.640]   so we can really find out what the investor experience is.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.080]   So could you explain the difference between the two?
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.760]   - If I'm trying to answer the question,
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.680]   how did the average large cap manager do?
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.840]   I've got, you know, let's say 1,000,
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.160]   I'm making the number up here, 1,000 funds to evaluate.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.520]   One way to do it, as you say,
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.480]   is take the returns of all 1,000,
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.840]   add them up, divide by 1,000.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.280]   That's equal weighted.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.160]   The problem with doing that is that you may have,
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.280]   you know, some funds that control $50 billion
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.760]   and another fund that controls $1 billion
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.480]   and you're treating them as if they're equally important.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.740]   So the other way to do it is what we call asset weighting,
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.880]   where you weight each fund's return
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.440]   by the amount of money
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.560]   or the amount of assets that the fund has,
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.960]   and then divide by the total value
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.240]   of all the assets across all the funds.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.420]   So that gives you an asset-weighted rate of return.
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.160]   And the difference between those numbers
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.240]   will tell you whether the larger funds are doing better
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.200]   or doing worse than the smaller funds.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.420]   If the asset-weighted number is 12%
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.320]   and the equal weighted number is 10,
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.640]   that tells you the larger funds, or at least some of them,
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.200]   the larger funds did better
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.740]   and the reverse if the numbers are reversed.
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.260]   And over the long enough time horizon,
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:13.120]   what you quite often see is that both the simple average
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.520]   and the asset-weighted average return of these funds
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.200]   is less than that of the index to which is being compared.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.480]   - But how much of a difference is it?
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.280]   I mean, is it better to get in bigger active funds
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.200]   than smaller active funds?
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.360]   - Depends on the period.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.240]   I don't think I could make a blanket judgment about it.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.120]   This last six months, for example,
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.760]   I mentioned we just published a SPIVA
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.700]   for the first six months of 2022.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.120]   The last six months,
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.640]   the asset-weighted average did less well
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.140]   than the equal weighted average,
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.520]   meaning the smaller funds did better.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.680]   But there have been years when the reverse has been true.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.120]   - So it's probably pretty equal then over time.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.480]   - I would think so, yeah.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.360]   I mean, I would think so.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.800]   - And you've also done,
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.800]   you've added this over the last few years.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.960]   You tried to do some risk-adjusted numbers.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.960]   So you're looking at sharp ratios,
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.440]   which is a function of adjusting for,
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.320]   call it the volatility of the funds.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.580]   - Yes.
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.800]   - And what has that shown?
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.640]   Has that, in other words, are the active funds,
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.120]   even though they're underperforming, they're less volatile?
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.280]   Is that a factor?
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.480]   - No, that is, in fact, just the opposite.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.920]   The average actively managed fund in the SPIVA database
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.040]   is more volatile than the index
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.180]   to which it's being compared.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.000]   Tim Edwards and I did a paper about this
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.360]   some years ago now.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.640]   It's called "The Volatility of Active Management."
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.240]   It's very clear that most active managers
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.040]   do not produce less risk than the benchmarks
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.440]   that you're comparing them to.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.100]   The one thing that is particularly interesting
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.280]   about that paper, as I'm recalling it,
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.120]   is that unlike returns,
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.400]   where a manager might have good returns one year
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.880]   and bad returns the next, and that fluctuates,
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.320]   the volatility profile of funds is fairly stable.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.200]   So if you have a fund that is relatively more volatile,
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.640]   say a large-cap fund, relatively more volatile
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.680]   than the S&P 500 this year,
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.440]   it's probably gonna be more volatile
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.680]   next year and the year after that,
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.600]   and probably the same for the years in the past.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.040]   So there's some stability in volatility of active funds,
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.920]   but there's no, I mean, some funds, yes, are less volatile,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.120]   but the majority are not.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:32.080]   - So you also do this for international equities
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.960]   and for U.S. bonds.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.880]   So let's start with the international equities first,
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.680]   which is a completely different database.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.320]   I mean, you're in a completely different market.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.120]   It has nothing to do with the U.S.,
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.720]   nothing to do with the original U.S. SPIVA.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.040]   Is the data the same?
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.920]   - The conclusion is the same, yes.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.840]   I mean, I can answer the question really in two ways.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.660]   One is that as part of U.S. SPIVA,
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.680]   we look at international funds or global funds
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.400]   that trade in the U.S., so same database,
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.760]   and that gets you the same answer.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.840]   But then our business has expanded internationally.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.880]   Other clients in other regions have said,
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.440]   well, what about Canada?
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.280]   What about Europe?
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.160]   What about Australia?
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.440]   And so we've begun to publish,
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.800]   we have now published SPIVA, I think,
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.960]   in 10 or 12 different regions,
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.680]   Europe, Australia, Latin America, Canada.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.560]   I'm sure I'm leaving things out, India.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:33.560]   And the conclusion is remarkably consistent.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.840]   I mean, there are exceptional years, yes,
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.520]   in all these places.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.880]   But if you look at long periods of time,
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.360]   even an interval as short as five years,
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.240]   the majority of active managers underperform
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.680]   a benchmark that is appropriate to their investment style.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.560]   It's very, very consistent.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.840]   - So let's go back, circle back to,
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.800]   investors here in the U.S. are investing
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.360]   in international or foreign stocks
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.080]   through foreign mutual funds
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.720]   that are managed here in the U.S.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.520]   - The conclusion is the same.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:10.120]   Yeah, there's no evidence that the managers
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.760]   of international funds do any better
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.800]   than the managers of domestically focused funds.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.760]   - Okay, I have to ask you this,
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.200]   because a lot of people say,
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.080]   well, yes, but not in emerging markets.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.400]   I mean, emerging markets, you can go out
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.560]   and you can find active managers
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.640]   that are gonna outperform.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.000]   I mean, do you find that to be true?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.400]   - Well, some, sure.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.680]   But there's no consistency there either.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.680]   I mean, I think the thing that makes SPIVA results
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:37.080]   what they are is that in most markets,
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.100]   including emerging markets,
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.040]   including all of the international markets I mentioned,
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.160]   in most markets, the investment business
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.200]   is very largely institutionalized.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.960]   Most of the money is controlled and managed
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.960]   by institutional, by which I mean mutual fund,
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:00.400]   pension fund, endowments, professional asset managers,
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:05.100]   which means that the managers of emerging market funds
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.280]   or the managers of Canadian funds,
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.600]   the managers of U.S. funds
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.960]   are competing against other professionals
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.960]   who have the same skillset, information access,
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.160]   computational ability, knowledge of the markets.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.720]   It's a fair game.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.460]   It's not like, as it might have been in the '50s,
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.640]   for example, it's not like one set of investors,
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.960]   the professionals, have access to information
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.960]   and trading data that is superior to that of others.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.040]   And so the ones with superior knowledge
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.920]   can take advantage of the ones with less knowledge.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.920]   Here, it's professionalized pretty much across the board.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.780]   - Well, here in the U.S. anyway.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:47.200]   - Certainly in the U.S., and increasingly globally too, yeah.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.500]   - But let's get into fixed income.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.980]   So you also do this with fixed income.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:55.980]   You look at treasury indices versus managed treasury funds
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:00.480]   and corporate bond funds versus corporate bond indices.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.960]   And does the data hold there?
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.820]   - Yes, although I would say it's more volatile there
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.460]   because in the following sense,
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.400]   if you're in an environment where interest rates
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.880]   are increasing, as we have been now,
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.800]   if most fixed income managers
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.360]   have a duration in their portfolio
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.200]   that is less than that of the index
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.960]   to which they're being compared,
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.800]   then a majority can outperform
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.480]   in periods when rates are increasing,
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.880]   and they will then underperform
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.880]   in periods when rates are decreasing.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.560]   So the importance of the maturity/duration decision,
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.080]   what's the average maturity of the bonds in the portfolio,
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.960]   is what I mean by duration.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.720]   The importance of duration in fixed income analysis
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.560]   is just overwhelming.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.280]   If you get that decision right, you can get a lot wrong
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.360]   and still be a really good bond manager.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.360]   And because it's so important,
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.560]   I think you see more fluctuation.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.640]   You'll see, in some categories, a large majority
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.720]   outperform one measurement period
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.140]   and then underperform in the next measurement period
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:11.040]   simply because the direction of interest rates is changing.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.720]   The other thing to keep in mind about fixed income markets,
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.280]   certainly government, the treasury markets in particular,
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.200]   is unlike the equity markets
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.080]   where basically all of the players are,
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.840]   you know what an economist might call,
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.600]   rational profit maximizer.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.440]   My fund, I'm trying to make a lot of money.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.280]   Your fund, you're trying to make a lot of money.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.640]   In the fixed income market,
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.480]   there is one very large player
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.920]   who is not a profit maximizer,
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.040]   that being the Federal Reserve.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.040]   So you have another presence in fixed income
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.040]   that sometimes, depending on his interest rate decision,
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.020]   sometimes helps the managers,
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.840]   sometimes hurts the managers.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.000]   But there is this other factor
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.040]   which you don't see in the equity world.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.480]   - I guess it would be also a little different
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:02.480]   because the dispersion of returns among bond managers
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.800]   is going to be much narrower.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.360]   - Much lower, much lower.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.840]   - Than the dispersion of returns of equity managers.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.000]   - Yeah, oh, very much so, very much so.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.440]   In fact, David Swenson, the late head of the Yale endowment,
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.000]   I think at one point was quoted as saying,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.240]   the difference in performance
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.040]   between a top decile bond manager
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.040]   and a bottom decile bond manager
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.080]   was so small that it wasn't worth your time
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.200]   to try to figure out who was who.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.920]   - (laughs) Very good.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.640]   Okay, so Spiva, congratulations on 20 years of data.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.360]   I will say that I've been following this market
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.360]   for 30 years, 35 years.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:44.360]   And it's remarkable that what S&P Dow Jones has done,
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.840]   your data has correlated so highly with others
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:54.840]   like Morningstar does the same study and the same results.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.680]   Now they might use different indices,
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.280]   but it's the same result.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:02.560]   And Vanguard does a annual study too.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.960]   And it's the same result.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.200]   So they're using different indices,
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.560]   but again, it doesn't really matter that much.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:13.560]   The results all come out to about the same
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.200]   and the results are this,
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.080]   can active funds beat the benchmark?
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:24.080]   The answer is yes, but not many,
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:28.400]   not by much, not for long,
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.640]   and the winners are not predictable.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:36.000]   And with that, let's get into the second study that you do,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.320]   which is called a persistence study.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.120]   So tell us about persistence.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.400]   - Okay, the persistence scorecard.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.200]   So-called uses the same database as SPIVA.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:52.200]   So it's the same CRISP survivorship bias-free database.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:57.280]   And the question that we asked in the persistence scorecard
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.600]   is really very simple.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.600]   It says, for example, let me identify all of the funds
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:08.080]   who were above average two years ago
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.440]   and say of those that were above average two years ago,
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.880]   how many were above average last year?
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.520]   We go back five years and say,
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.240]   of those who were above average five years ago,
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.160]   how many were above average four years ago,
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.360]   three years, two years, one, and so forth?
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.240]   - So what you're trying to measure here then
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.800]   is it does the outperformance carry forward?
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.840]   - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:31.840]   Recognizing that only a minority of active managers
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.000]   outperform in a given year,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.480]   if I focus on the more successful active managers
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.800]   in the historical data,
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.240]   will I be more successful going forward?
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.760]   The simple way to say,
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.600]   question that the persistence scorecard tries to answer is,
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.480]   do winners continue?
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.600]   Do losers continue?
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.820]   Is there persistence in skill?
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:55.560]   - Or does it ask, is there actually skill
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.920]   or is it randomness?
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.960]   - The way to think of it is this.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.640]   When you identify a manager who has outperformed,
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:08.140]   how can you tell whether his outperformance
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:13.060]   is a result of genuine skill or simply of good luck?
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.740]   And the answer to that question is,
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.260]   genuine skill should persist.
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.700]   Good luck is ephemeral, comes and goes.
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.500]   You're lucky this year, not last year, or not next year.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.820]   And so what the persistence scorecard does is to,
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:32.620]   at various time horizons and various breakpoints,
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:37.240]   look at funds which have outperformed historically
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.580]   and ask, did their outperformance continue?
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.700]   For example, there are many, many cuts
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.320]   in the persistence scorecard.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.980]   One thing we do is to say,
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.100]   let's go back to 10 years of data,
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.260]   take all the managers who were above average
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.900]   in the first five years and say,
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.260]   how did they do in the second five years?
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:00.260]   And obviously, if you were in the top half of the universe
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.940]   five years ago, in the first five years,
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.520]   and skill persists, the likelihood is
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.560]   you should have a lot higher probability
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.240]   of being in the top half of the distribution
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:14.240]   in the second five years than the managers
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.480]   who were in the bottom of the distribution
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.880]   in the first five years.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.040]   And what the persistence scorecard tells us is
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.720]   that there's relatively little persistence.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.520]   In other words, the example I just posed
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.320]   the last time we ran persistence,
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.760]   if you take, again, all large cap managers,
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.440]   go back 10 years, take the first five years,
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.000]   and say, of the managers who were above average
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.320]   in the first five years, how many of them
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.840]   were above average in the second five years?
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.320]   The answer was 42%.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.400]   - So less than half.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.600]   So this is like a random event.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.480]   I mean, if you think about it,
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.480]   it's like, well, it seems like half should be,
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.920]   at least half.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.520]   - Yeah, no, exactly right.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.000]   That's the default is half.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.400]   In other words, if the results are completely random,
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.920]   half of the managers are gonna be in the top half.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.840]   And it turns out that somewhat less than half
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.240]   of the top half managers from 10 years ago
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.760]   are still in the top half in the second five-year period.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.480]   - Now, what about the bottom half?
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.920]   Did any of the managers in the bottom half
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.880]   end up in the top half?
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.500]   - Oh, sure, sure.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.440]   - Well, I'm actually looking at the data right here,
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.360]   and it does look like the bottom half,
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.700]   a little less than 20% of the bottom half
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.340]   ended up in the top half.
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.280]   But about 15% of the bottom half
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.560]   ended up going out of business.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.960]   Whereas the top half, only about 6% went out of business.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.200]   So I guess what you could say about the top half
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.720]   is there's a lower probability
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.960]   they will merge or go out of business.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.080]   So they have that momentum,
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.160]   probably because they have a lot of assets in the fund
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.500]   if they're in the top half.
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.940]   - Yeah, and there's some persistence, I think,
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:55.940]   not of performance, but of stickiness of funds.
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.680]   If you're in a fund, you may not want to get out
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.200]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.280]   So if your historical success,
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.960]   if you look, let's say, at the large-cap funds
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.160]   do this five-year exercise,
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.400]   if you're in the top half in the first five-year period,
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:15.120]   you're less likely to go out of business or to liquidate.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.560]   You're not particularly likely, necessarily,
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.840]   to repeat in the top half,
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.400]   but you're likely to live, to persist,
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.880]   in terms of still being around.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.100]   Now, you also divided these down into quartiles.
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.020]   So you can look at the top quarter,
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.420]   and then the second quarter,
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.660]   and then the bottom three quarters,
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.100]   and then the bottom quarter.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:39.540]   And it doesn't appear, overall,
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.900]   that it's much different than random,
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.580]   what happens to a fund.
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.340]   - That's a very fair summary.
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.460]   Again, coming back to the way the exercise works,
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:50.460]   if skill is randomly distributed,
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.540]   or results are randomly distributed,
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.100]   in any given period, 25% of the managers
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.740]   are gonna be in the top quartile.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:02.940]   So if you look at large-cap U.S. managers, again,
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.940]   and say, look, in the first five years,
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.780]   what percentage of large-cap U.S. managers
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.340]   who were in the first quartile in the first five years
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.900]   repeated in the first quartile in the second five years?
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.740]   The answer, again, the most recent persistence scorecard
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:20.460]   was about 27%, not really much better than random.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.300]   - Random.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.340]   - Yeah, and if you go to look at mid-cap and small-cap,
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.820]   it's even worse.
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:28.100]   - A manager who has skill, like a bowling team,
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.140]   or a top tennis player, should continue.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.660]   I mean, they should continue to win.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.260]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:40.260]   The fact that the persistence scorecard says what it says,
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.740]   in other words, that there is no predictive value
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.120]   in historical performance,
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.860]   I mean, I think it says two things, Rick.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:52.420]   One is, it reminds us that what active managers
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.540]   are trying to do is very difficult.
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.220]   It's so difficult that most of them
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.500]   don't do it particularly well.
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:03.820]   And secondly, it reminds us, as investors
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:07.780]   who are potentially identifying funds to buy,
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:12.340]   that historical performance is not a good gauge
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.480]   of what will happen in the future.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.780]   - Some have said that fees are a good indication.
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.300]   In other words, if you have low fees,
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.080]   you have a higher probability of outperforming.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.140]   Do you work any of that into your studies?
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.020]   - It, yes.
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:29.500]   There's a, I guess I'll give you an answer at two levels.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.940]   One, we haven't done the study directly.
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.460]   I know Morningstar has, and the summary
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.420]   is exactly what you say.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:40.900]   If you were, instead of picking a fund
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.220]   based on past performance, if you picked a fund
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.180]   based on, I want something in the lowest quartile of fees,
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:49.780]   that's a more sensible strategy than picking a fund
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.400]   that has outperformed by a lot recently.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.200]   What we have done in SPIVA is,
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.600]   and we don't do it every six months,
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.960]   but we'll every year do what we call
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.840]   an institutional SPIVA.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.920]   And what we do in institutional SPIVA,
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.320]   among other things, is to take all of the funds
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.640]   that were in SPIVA, classic SPIVA that we were talking about
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.480]   and add back their fee.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.320]   - Ah, you do a gross, you do a gross.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.200]   - We do a gross of fees.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:22.760]   And not surprisingly, somewhat fewer managers
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:26.000]   underperform when you don't count their fees,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.080]   but it's still a majority.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.020]   I mean, I remember when the very first
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.560]   institutional SPIVA came out,
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.280]   I remember doing a meeting with a client
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.840]   and so I'll make it as simple as I can.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.800]   SPIVA tells us, classic SPIVA tells us
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.200]   that most mutual fund managers, net of fees,
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.920]   underperform most of the time.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.160]   Institutional SPIVA tells us
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.980]   that most institutional managers
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:53.680]   and most mutual fund managers, gross of fees,
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.400]   underperform most of the time.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.960]   The conclusion doesn't change.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.920]   I mean, the numbers change a little bit,
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:02.360]   but the conclusion doesn't change really at all.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.700]   - That's interesting.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.400]   I wonder how much of that is related
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.040]   to just the amount of cash
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.880]   that they have to have in a portfolio.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.720]   And bull markets occurring at times
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.160]   when there's cash in a portfolio,
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.160]   which is hurting performance and, you know,
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.800]   kind of an asset allocation decision
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.160]   as opposed to a stock selection decision.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.960]   - Part of it could be that,
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.680]   but we've done some work on this topic
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.120]   'cause we hear this objection all the time.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.440]   Well, you know, that index funds will outperform
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.560]   because they're fully invested in a rising market,
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.200]   but not in a falling market.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.400]   And if you look back at the falling markets
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.480]   in our historical database,
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:42.480]   look, for example, at, you know, 2001, 2002,
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.920]   the majority of managers underperformed.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.080]   2008, the majority underperformed.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.640]   So it's, the data don't really support.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.320]   - Can't make that argument about cash then, huh?
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.680]   - Yeah, it's, I mean, I think there's a slight advantage.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.440]   Sure, if the other thing to keep in mind, of course,
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.800]   is that, you know, we're at a point
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.720]   in the investment business now
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.440]   where sophisticated mutual fund managers,
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.800]   which I would think would include most of,
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.240]   most if not all of them, there are ways
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.600]   to equitize your cash.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.600]   If you have, you have to have a lot of cash on hand,
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.200]   you know, because you might get redemptions.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.360]   Well, you can buy index futures
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.960]   to so-called equitize the cash,
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.760]   give you the return of the equity market.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.160]   So I think that that wasn't possible,
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.560]   you know, 50 years ago, certainly,
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.640]   but certainly it is today.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.120]   And I think that that also, you know,
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.520]   rebuts that argument.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:41.120]   - Past performance is not an indication of future results,
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.560]   is really what the persistence studies show.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.520]   - That is a very good summary, yes.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.520]   - A lot of it is random.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.160]   Skill is very difficult to discern,
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.280]   very hard to go out and pick a manager
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.960]   that actually has skill.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.440]   And I get, one of the problems
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.000]   with trying to pick a manager that has skill
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.720]   is everyone is looking for these managers.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.400]   And if you actually identify somebody that has skill,
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.120]   the money is gonna just pile in,
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:11.120]   and that in itself could harm the performance of the fund.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.400]   We see that quite frequently.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.640]   - One thing I think we know for sure about fund flows
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:21.640]   is that the vast majority of fund flows
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:25.360]   come into funds that have recently done very well.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.640]   So especially if you think back to what you just said, Rick,
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.760]   that past performance is not a good indicator
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.640]   of future performance to allocate money
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.200]   based on past performance.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:40.520]   It's just saying you're almost asking to underperform.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.160]   Of course, that's what happens.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.160]   And it's understandable.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.680]   People want to buy something that has done well,
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.160]   except that the fact that it did well last year
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.920]   does not tell you much about how it's gonna do this year.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:57.360]   - So let's talk about a report that I did that you've read.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.200]   - Yes.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:02.240]   - So as a advisor for 35 years,
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.040]   if I just took client money
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.320]   and allocated it between stocks and fixed income,
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.720]   and then within the stock side,
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.000]   the U.S. stocks, international stocks,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.640]   and on the fixed income side,
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   treasury bonds, corporate bonds,
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.480]   or total bond market fund,
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:26.480]   and all I did was buy the cheapest index fund I could get
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.800]   on the U.S. stock side, total stock market index fund,
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.680]   or even an S&P 500 fund.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.840]   On the international side, a total international fund.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.160]   On the bond side, a total bond market,
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.120]   or if I wanted to have a municipal bond fund,
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.320]   a municipal bond index fund, or something similar to it,
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.440]   because Vanguard actually has actively managed
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.120]   municipal bond funds that are basically index funds
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.280]   because there's so many bonds in there.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.560]   But if that's all I did, what the study that I did,
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:01.120]   which is called the Case for Index Fund Portfolios,
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.520]   which actually came out 10 years ago
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.160]   with Alex Bankey as the co-author,
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.040]   if all you did was buy a portfolio of index funds
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.880]   and nothing else, forget about trying to pick active managers,
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:16.160]   forget about trying to pick managers
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.400]   who are gonna outperform the international market
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.120]   or the small cap market or whatever.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.360]   Just forget it, just buy all index funds,
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.960]   cheapest you can, and maintain your asset allocation.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:30.160]   The probability of the portfolio
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.240]   outperforming a portfolio that has either all active funds
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:38.320]   or some active funds in it is well over 90%.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:43.120]   And it's even higher in a portfolio sense
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.200]   than it is in each one of these silos,
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.080]   like large cap, mid cap, small cap.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.520]   When you put it all together in a portfolio,
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.440]   the probability of the portfolio
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.280]   outperforming a portfolio with active funds in it
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.680]   is actually higher than the individual silos
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.120]   because there might be a couple of active funds
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.360]   that you own that outperform,
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.240]   but the underperforming funds drag everything down.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.320]   So I've been pounding the table on this,
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.360]   and of course, Jack Bogle did for years,
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.200]   and the Bogleheads pound the table on this.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:18.120]   Just put together a few good index funds in a portfolio
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.360]   and hold it for the longterm and you'll be far better off.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.560]   Do you agree with that?
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.240]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.640]   I mean, I think the mistake people make,
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.960]   and what you addressed in your study, Rick,
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.120]   but the mistake people make is to say
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:37.560]   that diversification will help me.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.720]   So I'll pick an active US fund, for example,
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.880]   or maybe two active US funds,
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.400]   and then I'll diversify by picking an active
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:49.600]   international fund, an active bond fund, and so forth.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:53.920]   And the difficulty is that that works
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:57.560]   if the expected return or the expected benefit
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:01.040]   of buying those active funds is positive.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.800]   But if the expected benefit
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:05.040]   of buying the active funds is negative,
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.920]   which Spiva and other research demonstrate
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.200]   very clearly that it is,
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.760]   you're basically compounding the mistake.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.680]   I mean, another way to say that is,
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.240]   let's suppose I go into a casino,
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.920]   I go up to the roulette wheel and I put $10 on red,
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.960]   then I spend it, lose my money.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.600]   And the next roll, I go, I'm gonna put $10 on black now
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.960]   'cause I'm gonna diversify.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:34.280]   I mean, you're not diversifying anything except randomness.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.320]   What you identified in that paper,
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.840]   which is really important,
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:42.640]   is to my mind is conceptually similar argument
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:47.640]   to the reason why Spiva results are so much worse
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:51.760]   over a 20-year horizon than over a one-year horizon.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.520]   And that is that the probability of success
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.920]   is less than 50%.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.880]   I am a lousy basketball player.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.680]   So let's suppose that I was to get
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.720]   into a free throw shooting contest with Michael Jordan.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.400]   It's possible he might miss his first shot.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:13.000]   It's possible I might make my first shot.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.800]   So as the unskilled player,
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.360]   I don't want many, if we have to shoot 100 free throws,
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.320]   he's gonna beat me easily, easily.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.120]   Even 10, he's gonna beat me easily,
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.960]   but I might get lucky the first time or the second time.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:31.960]   So if you're a low-skill player, you don't want many trials.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:35.120]   You want relatively few.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.280]   - You wanna rely on luck.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.440]   - You rely on luck.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:41.760]   If you're a high-skill player, you want lots of trials.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:45.600]   And so in Spiva's case, lots of trials means,
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.240]   let's look not at one year, but at 20 years.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.880]   In the case of your paper, lots of trials means
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.840]   let's look at multiple asset classes,
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.600]   not just one asset class.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.200]   But they both point to the same conclusion,
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.680]   which is that the probability of success
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:04.480]   in picking an active manager is less than even.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.560]   That's why the results get worse over time.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.840]   That's why the results get worse
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.600]   when you use more asset classes.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.440]   - I think we made the conclusion in the paper
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.440]   that if you were going to go with active management,
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:17.240]   you put all your money on red and spin the wheel,
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.080]   like you were saying.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:21.600]   The more active managers you put in your portfolio,
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.680]   the lower the probability is that that portfolio
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.400]   will outperform a portfolio of index.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.120]   It's already low to begin with.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.160]   But as you add more active funds,
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.960]   the probability actually decreases.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.360]   And I'll just tell people that you can find this paper
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:37.240]   at my website at rickferry.com.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.920]   It's a case for index fund portfolios.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.240]   Again, the paper's 10 years old now.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.640]   It was published in 2012.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:44.920]   But the results are the same.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.760]   In fact, if we were to redo the study,
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.960]   or someone was to redo the study right now,
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:49.920]   going back 10 years,
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.640]   I think you'd find that the case
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:54.240]   for index fund portfolios was even higher.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.080]   - Absolutely.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.040]   - Than it was that we found in our paper.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:00.880]   Now, let me ask you about taxes.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.400]   Now, I know that you don't include taxes
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.840]   in your SPIVA report,
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.240]   but you probably have done some work on taxes,
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.080]   because a lot of individual investors
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.600]   have taxable accounts,
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:14.960]   and they have to pay taxes
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.200]   on capital gain distributions from mutual funds.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   So has S&P Dow Jones done any work on after-tax returns?
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:26.640]   - We have not done it ourselves.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.520]   I've certainly read some of the literature,
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.280]   and your question is the right one.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:35.520]   The thing to remember about index vehicles
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.720]   is that they typically are much more tax-friendly
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:42.480]   than actively managed vehicles,
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:47.120]   especially if you access them via an ETF,
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.440]   which has considerable tax advantages
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.360]   relative to a traditional mutual fund.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.560]   And since it's almost any index fund
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:58.480]   that you want to have access to
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:01.760]   can be got via an exchange-traded fund.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.440]   I'm not a tax authority or a tax lawyer,
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.480]   but it's what I do personally,
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.840]   and I can certainly recommend it
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.520]   as something for clients to think about.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.720]   - Yeah, it's interesting you think that.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.720]   We're off going on a little different topic here,
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.640]   but in my own personal portfolio,
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.680]   I only have exchange-traded funds.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.400]   Now, Vanguard's a little different
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.400]   because the ETF and the mutual fund,
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.720]   they're all the same.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:24.560]   It's all the same.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.640]   They're all treated the same for taxes,
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:29.040]   but if you're gonna buy an iShare or a Spyder
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.640]   or a Schwab fund,
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:35.080]   you're better off in a taxable account with the ETF
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.280]   because it doesn't spin off capital gains
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.680]   at the end of the year.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.080]   You only have to pay capital gains
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.960]   when you actually sell your shares.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.240]   You do have to pay taxes on the dividends,
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:47.240]   but not the capital gain distributions
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.960]   that you would see a lot in actively-managed funds.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:54.960]   So again, actively-managed funds in a taxable account
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.080]   creates another cost
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.040]   because of the capital gain distributions
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.040]   at the end of the year,
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:02.720]   and so all index funds all the time,
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.320]   whether it's your retirement account,
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:06.560]   whether it's taxable account,
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.120]   if you're gonna use it in your taxable account,
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:11.000]   using ETF certainly makes sense.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.120]   Any parting words for our Bogleheads listeners?
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.680]   I think the thing to keep in mind,
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:20.720]   and we've written about this a number of times at S&P,
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.080]   is two things.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.680]   One is the conclusion we've been talking about
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.080]   for the past hour or so,
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:29.080]   which is the majority of active managers
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.320]   underperform most of the time.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.440]   The second thing to keep in mind
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.720]   is this is not a coincidence.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:36.600]   It's not random that this happened.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.800]   There are good reasons why this happens.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.840]   We've talked a little bit about cost.
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.240]   I mean, index funds are cheaper
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.440]   than actively-managed funds.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:49.680]   The Investment Company Institute estimates every year
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:54.000]   the weighted average cost of U.S. actively-managed funds
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.760]   versus index funds is about a 60-basis point difference
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.280]   as of the most recent estimate.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.840]   That means, on average, an active manager
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.840]   starts 60 basis points in the hole.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.320]   It's a lot to make up.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.680]   The second reason, again, we mentioned this earlier,
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.840]   is the notion that in most of the world,
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:12.480]   certainly in the United States,
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.240]   the investment management business
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.640]   is very largely professionalized.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.920]   If you hire an active manager, let's say from Fidelity,
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.640]   and he's making a trade against an active manager,
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:26.520]   let's say from J.P. Morgan,
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.800]   the guy from Fidelity and the guy from Morgan
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   have access to the same information.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.040]   They read the same research.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.800]   They have the same Bloombergs on their desk.
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.840]   They probably went to the same MBA program.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.720]   They have the same CFA certificate.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.680]   There is a level playing field.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.600]   There's no reason to assume that one of these guys
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.800]   has an advantage over the other.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:49.520]   And that phenomenon of the professionalization
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.920]   was identified in kind of a famous article.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:56.680]   It was famous in the index world by Charles Ellis in 1975
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.240]   called "The Loser's Game."
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.640]   What Charlie did in that article,
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:03.120]   he surveyed the then post-war history
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.320]   of U.S. financial markets,
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.520]   so that was 30 years in 1975,
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:08.640]   and this is exactly what he said.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.840]   In the '50s, when the investment business
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:15.000]   was largely dominated by retail investors
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.800]   and relatively few professionals,
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.560]   it was possible for the majority of professionals
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.880]   to outperform because they had advantages
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.920]   that the retail investor didn't have.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:27.040]   As the business became increasingly professionalized
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:30.160]   in the '60s and '70s, that advantage went away
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.440]   because all of the managers got better,
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.680]   the professionalization took over,
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:38.680]   and we got to the point, even in 1975, let alone today,
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:43.680]   when it was impossible for any particular active manager
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.320]   consistently to have an advantage over the others.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:51.280]   That's why, by the way, index funds started in the 1970s,
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.640]   because professionalization was well along by then.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.200]   Some of the other arguments were just as good
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.440]   20 years later, but 20 years sooner,
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.840]   but that's the thing that happened.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:05.280]   So the fact that the majority of managers underperform
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:08.800]   most of the time is not random,
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:11.520]   it's not just a quirk of fate.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.600]   It happens for very good reasons.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:17.000]   Those reasons still exist, which means that the phenomenon
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.440]   is likely to continue to exist going forward.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.800]   So even though past performance
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.680]   is not a predictor of future returns,
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.760]   I feel safe saying that if you're in index funds,
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.800]   the future performance of index funds
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.200]   is going to be higher than actively managed funds.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.000]   In this case, past performance does predict future returns.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.480]   - I think that's a very fair statement, yes.
