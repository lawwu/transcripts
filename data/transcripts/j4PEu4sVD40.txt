[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820]   People whose favorite songs are their happy songs
[00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.700]   play it on their playlist about 175 times.
[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.880]   The people who love sad music play them about 800 times.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.080]   And they say that they feel connected to the sublime
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.180]   when they're listening to that music.
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.440]   The longing for what you lack is the very thing
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.800]   that gives you what you're longing for.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.160]   So the longing is the cure.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.520]   - The following is a conversation with Susan Cain,
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.200]   author of "Quiet, The Power of Introverts in the World
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.400]   "That Can't Stop Talking" and her most recent book,
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.720]   "Bittersweet, How Sorrow and Longing Make Us Whole."
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.880]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.480]   in the description.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.160]   And now, dear friends, here's Susan Cain.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.080]   You've written on your website that, quote,
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.060]   "I prefer listening to talking, reading to socializing,
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.320]   "and cozy chats to group settings."
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.120]   So I think this conversation in the podcast
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.520]   is gonna be fun.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.920]   What's a good definition of an introvert?
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.320]   Is something like those three things a good start?
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.500]   - It is a good start in terms of how introverts
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.260]   experience day-to-day life.
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.040]   I think a good definition is one that some of your listeners
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.800]   will have heard many times before,
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.320]   the idea of where do you get your energy?
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.120]   And for some people, they get their energy
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.640]   more from quieter settings, and for other people,
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.960]   they get it more from being out there.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.820]   So a good rule of thumb is to imagine that you're at a party
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.560]   that you're really enjoying, and you've been there
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.440]   for about two hours or so,
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.280]   and it's with people you really like,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.840]   and it's in your favorite place, so it's all good.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.760]   An extrovert in a setting like that
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.940]   is gonna feel charged up, and they're gonna be looking
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.440]   for the after party.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.000]   And an introvert, no matter how good a time they're having
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.840]   and how socially skilled they are,
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.000]   there's this moment where you just wish
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.680]   that you could teleport and be back at home.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.760]   - Yeah, and that the time before the start of the party
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.920]   to the time when that moment happens
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.160]   is different for different people.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.320]   So the shorter that is, the more of an introvert you are?
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.680]   Is that that kind of thing?
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.200]   - The shorter the moment until you get to the place
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.640]   where you've gotta teleport home.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.800]   - I've gotta teleport home.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.560]   - Yeah, and then for extroverts, it's the opposite.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.580]   They're gonna feel, maybe they're working on,
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.100]   I don't know, focused on producing a memo
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.560]   that's really intensely interesting to them,
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.280]   but if they're in that state of solitary,
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.400]   the solitary mode of really focusing,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.520]   they might get stir crazy a lot faster
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.100]   than an introvert would.
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.320]   And so it doesn't have so much to do
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.520]   with what you're good at as how you get your energy.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.680]   - And so for an introvert, the source of energy
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.880]   is what, silence, solitude, and for an extrovert,
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.200]   it's interaction with other people?
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.580]   - What I'd really say is that,
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.580]   and this is neurobiological as well,
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.980]   is that it has to do with how your nervous system
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.740]   reacts to stimulation.
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.620]   So for an introvert, you're feeling
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.380]   in a great state of equilibrium
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.460]   when there are fewer inputs coming at you.
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.960]   So they could be social inputs,
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.780]   but that's why an introvert in general
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.660]   would rather hang out with one close friend at a time
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.140]   as opposed to a big party full of strangers
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.060]   'cause that's just too many inputs for the nervous system.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.520]   And for an extrovert, the nervous system
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.960]   needs more stimulants, so if they're not getting enough,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.560]   they get that listless and sluggish feeling.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.640]   - So if you're just walking through the world,
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.760]   like people listening to this, but in general,
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.200]   how do you know if you're an introvert?
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.400]   Like how do you empirically start to determine
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.640]   if you are in large part an introvert?
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.560]   - Well, I would start by just asking that question
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.280]   of what happens to you at around the two hour mark
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.120]   where you're having a good time.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.940]   - Go to parties?
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.780]   - I mean, imagine.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.600]   - Go to parties every day.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.080]   - But I also find, I'm curious if you have
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.180]   a different experience from this,
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.840]   but from all the years that I've been out there
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.120]   talking about this topic, I found that most people
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.440]   really seem to know once they're being honest
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.020]   with themselves, and maybe that's the question to ask
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.680]   is like if you imagine that you have a Saturday
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.280]   or a whole weekend where you can spend your time
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.080]   exactly the way you want to with no professional obligations
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.880]   and no social obligations, who would you spend it
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.360]   with, how many people, what would you be doing,
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.040]   and what does that picture that you're painting
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.180]   start to look like?
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.840]   - Yeah, so there's nuance to this though,
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.060]   because I'm sure for extroverts to get energized
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.980]   by stimulation, whether that's stimulation
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.520]   with other people, like it depends
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.760]   what that stimulation is, right?
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.280]   Like maybe you're not surrounded by the kind of people
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.780]   that you enjoy being around, so you know,
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.400]   maybe that has to do less with whether some characteristics
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.720]   of your personality, more has to do with the fact
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.300]   of what your environment is like,
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.680]   that's always kind of the question,
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.640]   do you want to be alone because everybody around you
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.280]   is an asshole, or do you want to be alone
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.440]   because you get energized from being--
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.920]   - Well, I would hold the variables constant, I guess,
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.960]   I would say, you know.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.800]   - Keep the assholes constant and see.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.120]   And then there's the other thing you kind of observe
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.960]   that there's a lot of people that will say
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.520]   they get energized from being alone,
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.780]   like people are exhausting to them or something like that,
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.960]   but at the same time, when you see them at a party,
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.600]   they seem like the life of the party.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.640]   - I know, and I hear from those people all the time,
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.480]   there's so many people like that.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.240]   - What would you classify them as exactly?
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.600]   Is it ultimately as the source of energy?
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.800]   Is it the most important thing?
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.680]   Or like how the heck are they the life of the party?
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.520]   - It's a bunch of different things, you know,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.960]   so first of all, just to say like a big caveat
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.600]   to all of this is humans are just amazingly complex,
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.920]   so you can't like explain every individual human
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.840]   through these parameters,
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.680]   even though I think the parameters are really valuable.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.440]   But that person at the party,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.600]   it could be that they're more of an ambivert,
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.160]   so they kind of are more in the middle of the spectrum.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160]   It basically means someone who's not extremely introverted
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.560]   or extremely extroverted, they're kind of in the middle,
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.520]   so maybe at a party,
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.480]   their more extroverted side comes out.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.160]   Or it could be an introvert who's gotten really good
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.440]   at the skills of acting more like a pseudo extrovert,
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.000]   and they pull that up at the moments that they need it.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.520]   - So they've learned how to fake it.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.680]   - Yeah, oh, there's a lot of people like that.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.680]   And I know this because like I think out of all the people
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.240]   on this planet you could be talking to,
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.160]   I've heard from the most number of those people.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.840]   Like they all come and tell me about their experience
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.160]   out in the world presenting a face
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.760]   that's different from what they feel.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.880]   - So one of the things you talk about is,
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.000]   at least in the West, we've constructed a picture of success,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.200]   and that picture is usually one of an extrovert.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.200]   Like when you imagine somebody who's a leader,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.640]   who's a successful person,
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.000]   that person has some of the qualities
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.920]   you would associate with an extrovert.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.760]   And so there's a lot of incentive for faking it.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.400]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.000]   If you wanna be successful, you gotta be able to fake it,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.880]   to sort of hang with the rest of the team.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.080]   You have to be able to be outgoing
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.400]   and all those kinds of things,
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.800]   and not be drained by the interaction.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.440]   - Yeah, but I mean, there are also a lot of introverts
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.200]   who figure out ways to draw on their own strengths,
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.880]   and they're incredibly connecting and successful,
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.840]   and they're great leaders,
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.720]   and they're not actually faking it.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.080]   They're more just figuring out ways to do it their own way.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.840]   You see a lot of people like that.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.000]   - Is there advice, is there lessons you can draw from that,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.960]   from just observing how you can be an introvert
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.560]   and be in a leadership position?
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.400]   - Yeah, it's kind of like a mantra,
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.960]   figuring out what your own strengths are
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.840]   and how to draw on them.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.040]   I think of a guy I know, Doug Conant,
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.120]   who had been the CEO of Campbell Soup for many years.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.400]   He's very introverted.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.440]   He's quite shy also, by his own description.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.800]   And he really cares about people.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.640]   And so when he started at Campbell,
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.880]   the employee engagement ratings of the company
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.600]   were all the way at the bottom of the Fortune 500.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.000]   And by the time he stepped down 10 years later,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.600]   they were all the way at the top.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.520]   And it wasn't that he was going out there
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.640]   and schmoozing people, but he really did care.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.600]   So he would find out who were the people
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.520]   who had really been contributing,
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.240]   and he would write to them personal letters of thanks.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.480]   And these letters meant so much to people.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.680]   They would carry them around with them.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.560]   And during his time, the 10 years there,
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.640]   he wrote 30,000 of those letters.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.840]   So that was his way of doing it.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.920]   That was his way of drawing on his own strengths.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   And you know what?
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.120]   He did that together with, of course,
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.120]   you sometimes have to go outside your comfort zone,
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.160]   no matter who you are.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160]   So he was doing plenty of that too.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.560]   Kind of combination.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.040]   - Yeah, the writing process
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.080]   and focusing on the one-on-one interaction,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.280]   I can definitely relate.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.880]   There's something deeply draining,
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.520]   which concerns me about like Zoom meetings,
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.840]   because it's some weird brain manipulation.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.680]   - Wait, say more.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.840]   - Well, 'cause you're not really engaged,
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.440]   but it wears on you the same way that it does a party.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.520]   It feels like you're emptying that bucket
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.960]   for the introverts,
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.840]   even though they're not participating at all in the meeting.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.320]   I mean, I suppose that's true for physical meetings too,
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.600]   but with Zoom meetings, remote meetings,
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.360]   it's so much easier to invite a larger number of people
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.480]   into the meeting.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.400]   So you're draining more and more of the introvert energy.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.760]   And probably extrovert too,
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.320]   but the introvert definitely.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.440]   I mean, it's interesting.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.320]   I would love to understand that more,
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.200]   because there's more and more push towards remote work
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.900]   without, I think, a deep understanding
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.400]   of why these meetings are so draining on people.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.040]   I just anecdotally have heard from that.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.060]   But maybe that's because the managers,
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.860]   the people who arrange the meetings,
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.680]   are just not sufficiently yet aware
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.280]   of the draining nature of them,
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.240]   so that they pull in too many people,
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.640]   they schedule them too regularly,
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.880]   so they need to adjust, that kind of thing probably.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.800]   - I think people are starting to realize,
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.680]   but I would say one reason that Zoom is so draining
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.680]   is because you can see your own self-presentation
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.320]   the whole time if you choose to.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.720]   And when you go into in-person, you can't.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.800]   So you're kind of freed of thinking about that.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.640]   - Oh, that's brilliant.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.740]   - So it's like an extra cognitive load
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.700]   that you're bearing the whole time.
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.080]   - Oh, yeah, that's brilliant.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.920]   - And you might wanna turn off the camera
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.800]   so you can't see yourself,
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.120]   but then you feel like, well, I have the ability to,
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.700]   so I probably should be doing it.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.960]   And then that alone is a decision that you're making.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.200]   - Yeah, there's probably studies on this now happening,
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.680]   either have happened or are happening,
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:07.680]   the effect of seeing your own face on camera,
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.840]   'cause it's reminding you
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.560]   that you're supposed to be acting a certain way.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.560]   And that is especially a stressful thing.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.600]   - Yeah, you can't be in the moment as much.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.280]   But I mean, for you, you make the decision
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.000]   to do all your podcast interviews in person, right?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.920]   And so--
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.120]   - And that's even when it's very costly.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.560]   If there's any kind of chemistry that contributes at all
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.400]   to the conversation,
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.080]   which I think most conversations have chemistry,
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.160]   even the boring work meetings, there's something there.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.000]   Because yes, you're trying to solve a particular problem
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.760]   at this particular time,
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.100]   but underneath it, there's a team building that's happening.
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.520]   And honestly, people also have told me about this,
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.880]   why they enjoyed the Zoom meetings during the pandemic,
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.080]   is like, they're lonely.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.480]   It's annoying to have to sit and listen
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.760]   to folks talk about nothing and so on,
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.840]   but they tune in anyway,
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.160]   because it's kind of lonely to sit there by yourself.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.520]   And that, I mean, there's a deep connection there
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.760]   when you're with other people.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.420]   And that is especially true when they're in person,
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.360]   which is a huge concern for me for more and more offices
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.580]   from a capitalist perspective,
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.240]   realizing, hey, why do we have these large office spaces?
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.840]   Why do we have to get people together?
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.040]   But I think in some deep sense, we do.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.640]   But then you also talk about that once we do,
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.160]   we wanna protect the introverts.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.240]   Like you don't want the open space, office space,
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.760]   which was a big fad for a while.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.400]   I don't know where people stand on that at this point.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.900]   - Yeah, I think people are figuring it out
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:52.280]   in a post-pandemic context, but I mean, I know what you mean.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.080]   So before I became a writer,
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.760]   I was a corporate lawyer for like seven years,
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.360]   and literally the only thing I miss from those years
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.360]   is hanging out with people at the office.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.080]   Like, I don't know, just some of the funniest moments
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.680]   I've had in my life came from being at the office
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.000]   until midnight with the other people I was working with.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.520]   So I know exactly what you're talking about.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.160]   Though I will say the offices there at that firm
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.720]   and at most firms in those days,
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.160]   everybody had their own office.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.640]   So it was like a dorm room,
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.960]   where it was like a long hallway
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.520]   with everybody in their own little dorm room.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.000]   So you had tons of privacy,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.920]   but you would also come out and hang out with people.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.640]   - You could just kind of roam whenever you want.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.680]   - And whenever you roam, that means you're kind of open.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.760]   You're looking for trouble.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.160]   You're open for interaction.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.360]   - And the extent to which you would keep your door open,
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.560]   you know, was it wide open or was it half a jar
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.520]   or just a little bit, those were all signals.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.280]   - So is there, 'cause you said re-energize,
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.080]   is there, do you like to think,
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.840]   and again, the human mind is complicated,
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.200]   but do you like to think of it as like a bucket
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.720]   that gets refilled for introverts in terms of energy,
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.720]   of social interaction that they're able to handle?
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.520]   Do you think of it like that,
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.280]   as a bucket that gets emptied and needs to be refilled?
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.560]   - I think of it, yeah, more or less,
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.360]   'cause I use the metaphor of a battery
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.880]   that gets recharged or not.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.920]   It's basically the same thing, different metaphor.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.760]   But yeah, but just to add on that,
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.000]   that there is a layer of complexity to that
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.640]   because you could be somebody
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.280]   who doesn't want the kind of social life, let's say,
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.080]   where you have to be like on and presenting
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.120]   and interacting with tons of people all the time,
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.720]   but you'd get really lonely if you were just by yourself.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.360]   You know, so what you want is to maybe be in the company
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.760]   of a couple people you know really well.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.640]   Like for me, the pandemic was not actually that hard
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.560]   for me personally.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.600]   I mean, I lost family, but I mean,
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.720]   from the point of view of what we're talking about,
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.480]   it wasn't that hard because I live with my husband
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.080]   and my kids.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.140]   So I knew it was hard on the kids and I felt badly for them.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.920]   But for me, I was like, you know what?
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.880]   I have a lot of social life right here in the house.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.720]   - That's why you love your husband.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.280]   - And I can focus and do my work.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.780]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.980]   - That's the cool thing about the pandemic.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.280]   I think it helped people figure out
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.960]   how much they love their family.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.240]   - I think that's true.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.680]   - And a lot, it gives you a chance
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.880]   to really reconnect with kids,
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.160]   with your kids, like really spend time with them.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.360]   Which is fascinating to watch.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.920]   Like people actually, it did strengthen the family unit
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.960]   in an often beautiful way.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.560]   Which just sucks to have to leave behind at this point.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.320]   - Yeah, and I think that's part of what people
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.000]   are not gonna wanna go back to,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.660]   that we need to solve for,
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:44.120]   to the extent that work becomes non-remote again.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.000]   I think people have just realized how precious
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.400]   those aspects of their lives are.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.160]   And you know, for somebody who's in a sort of
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.000]   conventional office job where you're going home
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.040]   and seeing your kids for an hour before bedtime,
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.000]   and that's your interaction with them,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.400]   that's kind of a ridiculous way to set things up.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.640]   - It's cool that you can get,
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.960]   I think a lot of places give you the option now.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.120]   Which is interesting, you get to optimize
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.400]   that element of your life.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.080]   You take the commute and the office work
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.360]   and then the social interaction there,
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.760]   do you focus on the work at home?
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.120]   It's also lonely at home,
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.640]   but then you get to see your kids if you have kids.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.240]   That's part of the optimization,
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.640]   is like I have some options now
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.600]   and I'm gonna try to optimize
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:30.120]   solitude, loneliness, happiness, productivity,
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.840]   seeing family, seeing coworkers,
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.760]   the chemistry with the team building with the coworkers
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.320]   versus just the raw exchange of information
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.320]   with the coworkers.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.640]   It's fascinating to see how that kind of evolves.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.520]   - Yeah, and then there's the third space idea
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.640]   of the spaces where you're in a coworking space
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.240]   or a cafe or something like that.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.640]   You've got other people around you,
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.320]   but you're not exactly interacting with them,
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.440]   but they're very much there.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.960]   And that's huge too.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.360]   I don't think we think about that enough.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.320]   - Yeah, that energy's there.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.800]   I lived in Manhattan for 17 years before we had kids.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.520]   And I absolutely loved it.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.680]   I loved it, the feeling of all that energy all around you,
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.200]   but you could be anonymous within it.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.280]   To me, it was perfect.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.120]   - Yeah, it's beautiful.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.240]   I worked this morning for a few hours,
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.560]   programmed for a few hours at a Starbucks.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.880]   And first of all, wearing suits,
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.400]   Manhattan is the one place you can kind of fit into
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.760]   'cause everyone's wearing suits.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.760]   - Do you wear suits every day?
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.920]   - Well, these days, unfortunately,
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.400]   'cause I get recognized,
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.520]   I wear usually not suits when I just on my own life.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.760]   But yeah, I love it.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.840]   I love the way it feels.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.840]   I don't know.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.360]   And the way I think about the world when I wear a suit,
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.600]   I take it seriously as if my life is gonna end today.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.960]   Like this is what I would want to wear.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.800]   Not for physical appearance,
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.880]   but just for some reason it makes me feel like focused.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.720]   I don't know.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.200]   - So even if you're not gonna see anyone,
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.120]   you would still put the suit on when you're doing your work?
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:07.960]   - Especially then.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.800]   - Really?
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.560]   - Especially then, yeah.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.680]   Yeah, I really love doing that.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.960]   - So it like tells you seriousness of purpose,
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.800]   something like that?
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.800]   - Like everything's elevated now?
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.640]   - I don't know what it is.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.080]   I don't know what I imagine exactly,
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.680]   but it's some kind of platonic form
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.520]   of like a mixture of James Bond
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.440]   and like, I don't know who else, Richard Feynman.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.280]   Can I think about when I think about a suit?
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.640]   - You know, I think of Leonard Cohen,
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.040]   but he was always wearing suits too, but you know.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.720]   - Leonard Cohen is definitely one of my,
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.240]   is a tragic human, is a beautiful human being.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.560]   Through his words, through his own private life.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.560]   Yes, I definitely would think about Leonard Cohen.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.940]   So small talk, that's another thing.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.840]   Is that part of the equation of introvert versus extrovert?
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.680]   - Well--
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.120]   - How much people enjoy small talk?
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.840]   - I kind of went into this whole thing thinking that it was,
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.520]   but from what I've seen, most people,
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.080]   my study is that most people don't like small talk.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.840]   I think that's why people like your podcasts,
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.880]   'cause you're like, forget the small talk,
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.440]   I'm going deep into it from the very beginning.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.600]   - Yeah, so it's actually, the picture you're painting
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.160]   is like the way you started, like with your,
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.000]   with the book "Quiet," and the way you are today
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.680]   is you realize the picture may be more complicated.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.600]   - Yeah, everything's more complicated.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.280]   I will say with the small talk thing
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.080]   that I'm curious if you have this experience,
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.760]   but I find it fantastic to have a career
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.760]   where I'm known for anti-small talk kinds of topics
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.560]   because it means that anywhere I go,
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.040]   like if I show up at a conference or something like that,
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.680]   no one does small talk with me.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.040]   They're like telling me about the deep truth of their lives
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.120]   from the first "Hello," and I love that.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.840]   And in normal life, you have to like wade through a lot
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.240]   before you know if people are ready to go there.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.200]   - Yeah.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.020]   - Do you have that experience too?
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.160]   - No, definitely, definitely,
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.160]   with people that know me for sure.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.880]   - But you forget how many people feel like they know you
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.160]   because of your podcasts.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.640]   - Oh, that's what, no, that counts.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.160]   'Cause I'm a huge fan of podcasts,
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   and I feel like before I ever became friends with Joe Rogan,
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.840]   I felt like I was friends with him
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.160]   'cause I was a fan of his podcast.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.200]   And so like, it was, I feel like it's a friendship.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.640]   I know it's a one-way friendship
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.120]   with all the people I listen to in podcasts,
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.000]   and even people who are no longer with us, like writers.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.400]   I feel like I have a relationship with them.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.360]   Maybe I'm insane.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.120]   - No, I totally feel that way.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.800]   That's the whole reason I became a writer.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.440]   - Like I'm friends with Leonard Cohen.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.800]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.160]   - And he's not aware of it.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.440]   - No, but I think that's the whole reason
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.800]   for writing or making music or whatever people do.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.920]   It's to be able to have those kinds of connections
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.160]   that don't require having to be in a room together.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.760]   'Cause there's only so many people
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.800]   you can be in a room with in your lifetime.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.800]   - The hard thing is, unfortunately,
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.080]   because I value human connection so much,
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.960]   and I only have, just like you mentioned,
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.440]   sort of a small circle of people I'm really close with.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.040]   By design, it always hurts me a lot
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.400]   to say goodbye to people.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.280]   Like you meet people,
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.720]   and you can tell they're beautiful people.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.560]   They're amazing.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.600]   There's something so fascinating about them.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.160]   They've had a complicated life.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.480]   Like you could see in their eyes
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.760]   and the way they tell their story in just a few sentences.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.920]   They've gone through some shit,
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.040]   but they also found some elements of beauty.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.760]   And then you get to realize,
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.000]   okay, well, there's a fascinating human here.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.440]   And all you get to say is a few words here and there.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.640]   It was like a funny little joke,
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.160]   maybe a dark joke here and there.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.680]   And then you just say goodbye,
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.360]   maybe hug it out, and you go on your way.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.120]   So that's a hello and a goodbye,
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.040]   and your paths will never cross again.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:13.040]   That makes me a sad walk away.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.840]   But I guess I wouldn't have it any other way,
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.760]   I suppose, is the reality is.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.520]   In your book, you talk about that sorrow,
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.960]   that sadness not being such a bad thing.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.000]   - Yeah, and when you just said that,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.040]   I just thought of this one moment in my life
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.560]   that I haven't thought of for 20, 30 years or something.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.360]   But it was when I was in law school,
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.280]   and a classmate of mine had his friend
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.560]   come to visit for the weekend,
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.000]   and the three of us hung out a lot,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.440]   and we just had an amazing time.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.560]   And then this other guy,
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.080]   who wasn't gonna be coming back anytime soon, if at all,
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.000]   sent a postcard to me.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.080]   And the only thing written on the postcard
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.840]   was this quote from Oscar Wilde.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.160]   And I don't remember the exact words,
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.320]   but it basically said that there's no pain as intense
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.600]   as the sorrow of parting from someone
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.960]   to whom you've just been introduced.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.880]   - Yeah.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.280]   - And there was something so intense about that,
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.680]   and so true.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.600]   I think partly also,
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.480]   because when you've just been introduced to somebody,
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.400]   you don't yet know their difficulties.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.200]   So you're seeing the most sparkling version of them,
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.560]   you're seeing a platonic version of love and friendship.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.400]   - And your imagination fills in the rest
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.040]   in some beautiful way that matches perfectly
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.000]   the kind of thing you're interested in.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   That's how I feel about one spoonful of ice cream,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.880]   and that's why you always finish the whole tub,
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.320]   and you regret all of it.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.400]   You do cite, what did you write this?
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.000]   I think this is on your website,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.560]   that one of the best things in the world
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.160]   is that sublime moment when a writer, artist, or musician
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.960]   manages to express something you've always felt,
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.200]   but never articulated,
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.440]   or at least never quite so beautifully.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.280]   So that's the Oscar Wilde line is one line like that,
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.200]   but just a line from a song,
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.560]   or maybe a piece of art that just grabs you.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.120]   Is there something that jumps out
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.760]   into memory like that for you?
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.960]   - I don't know if I have an exact line, though.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.920]   I mean, that feeling that you just quoted
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.400]   happens to me all the time.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.840]   I'm just bad at recalling exact instances, but--
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.680]   - Me too.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.520]   (both laughing)
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.720]   On the spot.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.960]   - But the writer Alain de Botton
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.480]   regularly makes me feel that way.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.960]   He's just this beautiful essayist
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.880]   and observer of human nature,
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.120]   and he's just constantly expressing things
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.560]   in this gorgeous way that you've experienced yourself.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.480]   And you feel like,
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.600]   I don't know, it's just this grand act of generosity.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.080]   You feel less lonely,
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.560]   you feel this deep sense of communion.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.280]   It's such an elevating experience.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.600]   - Even when it's a melancholy line.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.240]   - Maybe especially when it is.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.640]   - Yeah, what is that?
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.840]   (Lyle laughing)
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.960]   - There's a,
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.200]   so Jack Kerouac, "On the Road"
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.160]   definitely makes me feel that way,
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.820]   like every other line in there.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.760]   "Forlorn rags of growing old."
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.880]   - Do you know, I never read that book,
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.120]   so what was it about that book that made you feel that way?
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.400]   - Well, okay, well, since you asked,
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.040]   I'm going to linger on this.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.360]   So, there's a story,
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.120]   it's kind of the book,
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.960]   the kind of defining book of the beats,
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.440]   of the beat generation.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.440]   And it's basically a story of a writer
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.840]   who takes a road trip across the United States
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.580]   a couple of times,
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.040]   and experiences a few close friends
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.200]   and a few strangers along the way.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.880]   And there's a lot of just those
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.200]   melancholy goodbyes along the way.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.100]   You meet all these people with interesting lives.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.600]   Some of them are defined by struggle,
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.360]   some of them are defined by drugs, drinking,
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.080]   women, all that kind of stuff.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.120]   And still, he just kind of dances around all of that,
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.900]   and is defined by the goodbyes and the passing of time.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.880]   So a lot of the really powerful lines are basically like,
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.580]   there's one on there, again, I don't remember exactly,
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:10.580]   but he meets a beautiful girl at a rest stop,
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.640]   and the girl is getting,
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.100]   or a woman is getting on a different bus
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.520]   than he's getting on.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.520]   And so it's that feeling of falling in love
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.160]   for a second, and realizing that fate
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.840]   is just ripping that out,
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.440]   which is similar to this idea of,
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.480]   it sucks to say goodbye just when you met,
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.420]   but it's especially true when you fall in love
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.840]   just a little bit with that stranger,
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:43.660]   with all the possibilities that could lay there.
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:48.200]   So there's a few lines I've written down.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.080]   I went down this whole rabbit hole of thinking,
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.240]   what are the lines that grabbed me?
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.760]   A couple of lines from "On the Road."
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.120]   So one is, "What is that feeling
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.200]   "when you're driving away from people
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.540]   "and they recede on the plane
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.880]   "till you see their respects dispersing?
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.200]   "It's the two huge worlds vaulting us, and it's goodbye,
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.400]   "but we'll lean forward to the next crazy venture
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.640]   "beneath the skies."
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.600]   So this is him talking about leaving a particular city.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.720]   The spoiler alert towards the end of the book,
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.140]   rather the end of the book, line I return to often.
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.440]   It's more poetry, but it's a feeling
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.240]   that captures the book, I would say.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.240]   "The evening star must be drooping
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.520]   "and shedding her sparkler dims on the prairie,
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.640]   "which is just before the coming of complete night
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.920]   "that blesses the earth, darkens all the rivers,
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.740]   "cups the peaks and folds the final shore in,
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.520]   "and nobody, nobody knows what's going to happen to anybody
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.260]   "besides the forlorn rags of growing old."
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:51.520]   And it just captures this kind of in-the-moment appreciation
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.640]   of the beauty of the world and the sadness
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.640]   over the fact that time passes
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.560]   and you leave the people you love behind,
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.480]   you leave the places you love behind,
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.880]   or at least the way they were at the time
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.520]   that you really enjoyed them, and you just leave all that.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.600]   Just the sadness you feel when you,
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.980]   something about it, like look at her picture,
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.760]   look at your kids grow up,
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.140]   look at your old friends getting old.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.440]   Something makes you realize that time passes
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.240]   and somewhere deep in there is probably a realization
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.160]   of your mortality and it just makes you somehow first sad
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.480]   that everything comes to an end,
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:33.280]   and then that's immediately followed
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.120]   by sort of an appreciation of the moment,
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.760]   like a gratitude that you get to experience this moment.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.120]   - Yeah, I know it exactly.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.380]   I mean, that's the whole reason that I wrote "Bittersweet."
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.340]   It's all about that.
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.540]   (both laughing)
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.700]   So I know intensely what you're talking about.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.960]   And by the way, my husband loves the book
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.920]   "A Movable Feast" by Ernest Hemingway,
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.040]   which I also haven't read,
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.040]   but it talks about that same thing,
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.500]   groups of people traveling around together
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.180]   and the group coalesces into some magical formation,
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.680]   and then one person leaves the group
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.720]   and it's never gonna be the same again,
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.160]   and then they move on to the next one.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.760]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that's the deepest essence
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.060]   of human nature,
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:17.040]   the feeling of longing for some kind of state
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.400]   of perfect completeness, completion, perfect love,
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.040]   the Garden of Eden, all of it,
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:27.960]   and the feeling that you're never gonna quite attain it,
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.160]   but you get glimpses of it here and there,
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.220]   and that those glimpses are some of the best things
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.360]   that ever happened to us.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.920]   And there's a fused with sadness
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.660]   because they're not the real thing,
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.520]   or they're not the full thing, they're just a glimpse.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.280]   It's a glimpse of what we long for.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.040]   - So the sadness that we might feel
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:50.000]   is always connected to the ways in which we fall short
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.360]   from the perfect thing that we're,
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.720]   like there's always a thing you're longing for,
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.640]   and the sadness has to do with getting a glimpse of it,
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.800]   but not quite getting a hold of it.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.120]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.840]   - So it's always losing.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.320]   - It's always losing, but it's also always,
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.280]   but it's not, that sounds really depressing,
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.760]   but it's not, you know it's not depressing
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.160]   'cause you experience this all the time.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.560]   It's also, those are the most beautiful moments
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.400]   I think life offers.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.380]   I mean, it's intense, intense beauty in those moments,
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.000]   because it's getting closer to the real thing
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:25.960]   that we long for.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:31.440]   - So what about, like, loss, losing love?
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.200]   Is that also?
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.040]   (Lex laughs)
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.960]   A beautiful thing?
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.920]   - Well, the moments you're talking about,
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.920]   I think it's easier to appreciate the beauty of it all
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.480]   in the moment, because you're experiencing,
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.520]   you're kind of experiencing the loss and the love
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.820]   all at the same time.
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.920]   Whereas if you're talking about straight up loss,
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.640]   like a betrayal or a bereavement or whatever it is,
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.140]   that's, it's different, it's quite overwhelming.
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.880]   - So losing a loved one kind of thing.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.880]   - Losing a loved one.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.400]   I mean, I will say that the truth that I think
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.760]   that we can come to after a lot of time on this earth
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.720]   is the idea that love exists not only
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.280]   in its particular forms, so not only in the form
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.040]   of the one person, you know, that one person we love
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.640]   or that other person we love, but love itself is a state
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.620]   that we have access to, and so over time,
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:40.280]   the loss of person A can heal and you can tap into
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.460]   a kind of bigger river of love.
[00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.240]   - Yeah, I mean, I had this, this comes from Louis,
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.360]   Louis C.K., in a show, damn, I love that line.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.180]   I mean, there's, he talks to an older gentleman,
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:59.480]   and Louis is all sad about losing a loved one
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:04.540]   or getting rejected, essentially, like a breakup,
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.760]   and then the older gentleman gives him advice,
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:13.280]   saying, basically criticizes Louis for saying,
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.160]   "Why are you moping around?
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.920]   "'Cause this is the most, this is the best part.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.760]   "Like, losing love is the best part."
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.460]   'Cause that's, the real loss is when you forget.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:28.140]   Like, feeling shitty about having gone through a breakup
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:32.860]   is when you most intensely appreciate
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.400]   what that person meant to you.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:40.340]   Like, you most intensely feel love in some strange way
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.340]   by realizing that you've lost it, by missing it,
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.640]   wishing, at this moment, I wish I had that.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.820]   Like, that feeling, that's when you feel that love the most,
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:55.100]   the absence of it, and so the older gentleman gives advice
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.740]   that that's the best part, and it can,
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.340]   if you're good with it, it can last for the longest.
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:05.540]   It could be the most sort of prolonged experience
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.400]   of deep appreciation and emotion and so on.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:14.140]   So that's kind of a, that's a nice way to look at loss,
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:18.540]   which is a reminder of how much somebody meant to us.
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.180]   - Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of truth in that,
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.140]   because, yeah, you wouldn't care so much
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.660]   if it weren't something that mattered to you,
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.220]   so it's always a signpost to the direction
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.480]   you really wanna go to.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.620]   That's always what it is.
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.100]   Yeah, and it's interesting to see the way
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:42.100]   that the mystical versions of many of the great religions
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.380]   all point in this direction.
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.220]   You know, whether you were looking at Sufism
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.340]   or the Qabbalah or in Christian mysticism,
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:54.860]   you see this idea that the longing for what you lack
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:58.300]   is the very thing that gives you what you're longing for.
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.740]   So the longing is the cure.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.780]   I mean, that's the way the Sufi poet Rumi puts it.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.540]   The longing is the cure.
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:05.820]   You know, and he says, "Be thirsty."
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.460]   Like, be as thirsty as you possibly can.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.900]   That's what you wanna be.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.300]   - The good stuff is the wanting, not the having.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.820]   Yeah, yeah, of course, tell that to a person
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.380]   that just broke up, and they'll be like,
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.740]   "Shut up, asshole.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.560]   "We don't need your advice, this sucks.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.780]   "I wish I had her or him back."
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.320]   - Yeah, no, absolutely.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.120]   Those are the kinds of life lessons
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.620]   that only work when you kind of step away for a while.
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:35.320]   They don't work in the moment of excruciation.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.240]   There is something about the fact of knowing
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.520]   that all humans are in that experience together
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.620]   that is also incredibly uplifting.
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:48.900]   But that takes time for people to realize.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:54.380]   You know, like heartbreak in your early teenage years
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.300]   or something like that could feel like
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.260]   this is completely the most novel
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:04.260]   and the most dramatic pain that any human has ever felt,
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.020]   right, or maybe even when you're younger.
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:10.620]   And then one of the things you realize
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.060]   is that everybody goes through this.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.960]   That can be an awakening to the fact
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.540]   that we're all in this together,
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.740]   this human condition is not just a personal experience.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.580]   It's an experience we all share.
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.980]   And that's a kind of love, the unity of it.
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:25.900]   - Yeah. - That you can get
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.740]   to experience. - That's a really
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:27.580]   deep kind of love.
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:32.580]   And I feel like we're prevented from perceiving that love as,
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:36.300]   it's actually like the most obvious kind of love,
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.480]   and it's right there, and it happens all the time.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.140]   But we're prevented from perceiving it
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.100]   because we're not really supposed
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.660]   to talk about things like that.
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:45.380]   It's like there's something unseemly about it.
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.180]   - Well, it's also, in the West,
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.060]   it's an individualist society,
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:53.900]   so there's a pressure to sort of see the individual
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:58.900]   as a distinct sovereign entity that experiences things.
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.660]   And the unity between people is not obviously
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.580]   sort of communicated or talked about
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:06.600]   or is part of the culture.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.060]   - Yeah, it's not part of the culture,
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:12.380]   and yet you see it in our behaviors because we're humans.
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.460]   So why do people listen to sad music?
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:19.100]   I mean, one reason is they're hearing expressed for them.
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.460]   Like the musician is basically saying to them,
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.700]   this thing that you have experienced,
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:28.420]   I've experienced it too, so have lots of other people.
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.700]   But they're saying it all without words,
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.980]   and it's transformed into something beautiful.
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.340]   And there's something about that
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.460]   that's just incredibly elevating.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.900]   And people don't know it, but there's one study
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.620]   that I have in Bittersweet that found
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.180]   that people whose favorite songs are their happy songs
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:50.060]   play it on their playlist about 175 times.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.460]   But the people who love sad music
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.260]   play them about 800 times.
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:58.460]   And they say that they feel connected to the sublime
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.800]   when they're listening to that music.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.260]   - What do you think that is?
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.340]   So what is that?
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:08.140]   What is it in music that connects us
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.640]   to the sublime through sadness?
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.780]   - I mean, I have a bunch of different theories.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:19.260]   The whole reason I started writing this book
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:24.260]   is because I kept having this reaction reliably to sad music.
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.540]   And I realized that for people who I knew
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.100]   who were religious believers,
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.020]   the way they described their experience of God
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.280]   was what I was experiencing when I would hear that music.
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.660]   Like all the time, it happens over and over again.
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.100]   - So you wonder what that is?
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.580]   - And yeah, so I started wondering what that is.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:48.300]   And lots of people have tried to figure out
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.400]   what that's all about.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.540]   And there are different theories that it's expressing.
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:57.420]   It's like a kind of catharsis for our difficult emotions.
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.500]   That it's, as we were saying,
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.160]   a sense of being in it together.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:06.140]   We don't react in that sort of uplifted way
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:10.140]   when you just see like a slideshow of sad faces,
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.620]   which is something researchers have actually tested.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.180]   No one really cares when they're seeing the slide
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.340]   of the sad faces.
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.420]   But the sad music, they're really reacting.
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.900]   And also, they don't really react
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.500]   when they're hearing music expressing
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.900]   other negative emotions,
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.980]   like martial music or something like that.
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.640]   It's just the sad music that gives people
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.260]   this elevated sense of wonder.
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.660]   So I think it's the combination of the sadness
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.260]   and the beauty.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:37.420]   And I think it's just tapping into the essence
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.740]   of the human source code,
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.860]   which is a kind of spiritual longing.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.300]   Whether we're atheists or believers,
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.620]   there's this feeling of longing for a state
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.500]   and a place of perfect love and perfect unity
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.660]   and perfect truth and all of it.
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:54.180]   And like an acute awareness that we're not there
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.020]   in this world.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.220]   And in religions, we express that through the longing
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.380]   for Mecca or Eden or Zion.
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:06.140]   And artistically, we express it with Dorothy longing
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.660]   for somewhere over the rainbow.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:12.020]   Or Harry Potter enters the story at the precise moment
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.860]   that he's become an orphan.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.820]   So he's now gonna spend the rest of his life
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.780]   longing for these parents who he can never remember.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.380]   And there's something about that state
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.820]   that's at our very core.
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.760]   And I think that's why we love it so much.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.740]   - Well, it could be, you could have the Ernest Becker theory
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:33.140]   of denial of death, where at the core of that,
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:37.980]   the warm of the core, as Jung said, is the fear of death.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:42.020]   So where the longing for the perfect thing
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:45.980]   has to do with sort of becoming immortal,
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:50.980]   is reaching beyond the absurdity, the cruelty of life,
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:56.100]   that all things come to an end
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:01.100]   for no particularly good reason whatsoever,
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.220]   one we can rationally explain.
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.940]   - I know, you know, I wonder about that all the time.
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.820]   Like, I know obviously there's that idea from Becker
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.340]   and throughout philosophy and the tale of Gilgamesh
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.380]   about the idea that the thing we're longing for
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.960]   most of all is immortality.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.300]   But I feel like it's not only that.
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:25.300]   I think it's more so or also, let's say,
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:30.780]   a longing for the lions to lay down with the lambs, finally.
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:34.420]   You know, for like the fundamental calculus of the universe
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.460]   to just be different, where life doesn't have to eat life
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:38.740]   in order to survive.
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:42.060]   And yeah, just a completely different situation.
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:42.900]   - I wonder.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.620]   - That immortality would not solve.
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:46.820]   - I wonder.
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.820]   That could be a very kind of modern thing,
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.980]   'cause surely so much of human history
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.180]   is defined by violence and glorified violence
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:02.540]   that doesn't give inklings of this lions and the lambs.
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.980]   So much of-- - It's in the Bible.
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.100]   I mean, I know all the other stuff is in the Bible too.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.420]   - There's other stuff in the Bible,
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.780]   and the Bible, that particular aspect
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.900]   doesn't necessarily reveal the fundamental motivation
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.240]   of human nature.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.780]   There could be deeper stuff, you know.
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:23.420]   But yeah, that is a beautiful picture.
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:28.420]   But is it just about humans, or is it about all of life?
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:29.820]   And you have to think about
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.420]   what does the perfect world look like?
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.360]   It's not just the lions and the lambs laying together.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.420]   How many lions and how many lambs?
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:42.260]   - Right, right.
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:46.780]   - And you know, having just had a few
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.860]   very technical conversations about Marxian economics
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:53.580]   versus Keynesian economics versus neoclassical economics,
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.620]   what does the economic and the government system
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.660]   look like for the lions and the lambs
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.180]   that we're longing for?
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.380]   So then you start to build society
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.620]   on top of all those things,
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.420]   but still you return to this.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.340]   What are we longing for?
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.980]   And what's the role of love in that?
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:13.540]   What's the role of that sad, melancholy feeling,
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.820]   the feeling of loneliness?
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.420]   Is the feeling of loneliness fundamental
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.740]   to the human condition?
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:24.460]   Are we always striving to channel that feeling of loneliness
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.300]   to connect with others?
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.740]   We want that feeling of loneliness,
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.620]   otherwise we wouldn't be connecting.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:35.200]   Is that fundamental, that feeling like you're alone in this
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.540]   even when you're with other people,
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.660]   sort of alone together.
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.660]   You're born alone, you die alone.
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:41.300]   Maybe loneliness is fundamental.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.460]   - I think the longing for union is fundamental.
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.300]   It's just that it looks so different for different people.
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:51.580]   And coming back to what we were talking about
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:55.100]   at the beginning, union looks incredibly social
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.380]   for a lot of people and hardly social at all for others,
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.300]   but everybody needs some version of union.
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.940]   - Yeah, people have been telling me recently
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.820]   about polyamory and all those kinds of things.
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.220]   So having probably grown up in a certain part of the world,
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.780]   I'm very monogamy-centric,
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.540]   not in a judgmental way, just for me,
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:18.380]   what makes me happy is one person for my whole life.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.860]   Basically, just dedication.
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.500]   'Cause I've just seen through relationships
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.380]   with people and objects in my life,
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:31.660]   the longer we stay together, the deeper the tie.
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:36.220]   So that's just an empirical thing.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:40.180]   And yes, that probably is a personalized thing.
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.220]   That's just true for me.
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:43.100]   It could be very different for others.
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:46.540]   Maybe it's connected to the introverted thing, maybe not.
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:49.860]   Who knows?
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:53.380]   Before I leave, 'cause you mentioned songs, sad songs.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.060]   What are we talking about?
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:59.460]   What's a good, what song do you remember last crying to?
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:03.140]   - Oh, gosh, well, I mean, as you know, I--
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.380]   - Don't say Taylor Swift.
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:08.180]   - I literally dedicated my book to Leonard Cohen.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:10.700]   He's played such a huge role in my life.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.420]   I love him, I love him.
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.820]   And I've loved him with this crazy love
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:19.060]   that I've never been able to understand for decades.
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.980]   I think I understand it a little better now, but.
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:21.980]   (both laughing)
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:25.140]   - So you're better friends with him than me, I'm jealous.
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:30.140]   So does it make you, is it the musician or the human too?
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:34.380]   Because the human is a tortuous soul in a way.
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.340]   - I'd say it's the musician.
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.180]   It's the musician.
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.700]   I actually was thinking about this the other day.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.140]   Obviously he's not alive anymore,
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:44.020]   but I was kind of running the thought experiment.
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.660]   If he were alive still and I had the chance
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:49.900]   to meet him in person, would I wanna do that?
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:53.180]   And I'm not really sure that I would
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:58.180]   because he represents for me symbolically everything.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:04.180]   Well, everything, I'll end the sentence right there.
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.580]   And so, and I think that's okay.
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:10.100]   I think people can express something through their art
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.260]   that they might or might not express
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.660]   if you were just hanging out with him and having a coffee.
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.580]   And I'm happy to know him that way.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.620]   - He can express himself, I'm sure,
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.500]   in the way that you know him as over coffee too.
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.660]   - Yeah, maybe you would. - It just requires
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:30.660]   like a focus of remembering,
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:31.940]   like a deep focus of connection.
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:35.560]   That's why when I interact with folks,
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:41.560]   it's so draining for me because I'm putting all my,
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.960]   whatever weapons I got in terms of deeply
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.520]   trying to understand the person in front of me.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.560]   And doing that dance of human interaction,
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:55.560]   the humor, the intense kind of delving into who they are,
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:46:02.360]   which requires navigating around small talk type of stuff
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.960]   and just like compliments and so on in general.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.840]   Like people, depending on the culture,
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:08.840]   depending on the place,
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.240]   they'll sometimes flower stuff with smiling
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.440]   and like compliments like, "Oh, I love you.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.040]   "This is great."
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.000]   Like that's all great,
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.920]   but you wanna get to the core of like,
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.640]   what are the demons in the closet?
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.320]   Let's talk about it.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.560]   And that can be exhausting.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.720]   That can be really exhausting.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.160]   So from a Leonard Coe perspective,
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.360]   you get more and more famous.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.120]   It can be hard sometimes
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.560]   because he probably is also an introvert.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:35.440]   - Oh yeah, I know he was an introvert
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:39.320]   because he actually tweeted about my book when it came out.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.080]   So that was a precious moment for me.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.160]   Something about we should all be listening to the quiet.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.880]   I can't remember exactly what he said.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.680]   But yeah, yeah, no, he definitely was.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.960]   - He struggled with depression,
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.320]   which I wonder if that's something
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:55.400]   that's also connected to introversion.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.120]   But perhaps not actually.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.400]   Perhaps that they're very disjoint and also--
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.800]   - It's connected to sensitivity
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.040]   and many sensitive people are introverts.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.160]   So it's kind of like a Venn diagram.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.360]   It's about 80% of highly sensitive people are introverted,
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.080]   but then some are extroverts.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.280]   And then not all introverts are sensitive.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.720]   So it's complicated.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.200]   But he was definitely a sensitive type.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.240]   - Well, there's on top of that,
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.480]   you see like the percent of artists
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.600]   relative to the average that suffer from depression.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.160]   So creative people is very high.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.400]   - Very, very high. - It's crazy.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.120]   - Yeah, and then the number of artists
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.840]   and successful artists who were orphaned
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:32.680]   when they were young,
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.560]   who lost one parent or both parents,
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.080]   it's like an astronomical number.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.240]   I have it in the book.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.440]   I don't remember the percentage, but huge.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.360]   And he was one of them.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.040]   He lost his father when he was nine.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:45.120]   And his first act of poetry was,
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.160]   his father made suits.
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.040]   That's why I thought of him
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.960]   when we were talking about you in your suit.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.720]   And he took one of his father's bow ties
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.240]   and wrote a poem in his honor
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:01.400]   and buried the poem and the bow tie in the backyard.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.200]   And that was like his first creative act.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.080]   - You know that song, "Chelsea Little Number Two"?
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:07.920]   - Sure.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.280]   - Where he met, I guess it's about Janis Joplin.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.280]   - Janis Joplin, yeah.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:18.000]   - What a fun, intense, and cool person she is.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:18.960]   - Yeah.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.920]   - So I guess-
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.960]   - Have you ever seen, I'm sorry to interrupt you,
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.480]   but have you ever seen his son, Adam Cohn
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.960]   and Lana Del Rey perform that song together?
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.920]   - Oh, wow, no.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.880]   - It's incredible.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:31.880]   I have to send it to you.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:32.720]   - Yeah.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.840]   So that for people who don't know,
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.600]   I mean, maybe I don't know.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.320]   It goes, "I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.560]   You were talking so brave and so sweet,
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:46.120]   giving me head on the unmade bed
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.360]   while the limousines wait in the street."
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:53.360]   There's a good line in there about being ugly.
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.520]   - Oh yeah, we are ugly, but we have the music.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.840]   - No, before that, from a guy's perspective, it was-
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:03.200]   - Oh, you told me again, you preferred handsome men.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.120]   But for me, you would make an exception.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.120]   Yeah, so good.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.920]   - Well, she continued that thread in later
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.560]   because I think she said that he was lousy in bed.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:14.400]   - Oh, is that right?
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.160]   - Yeah, she publicly said that.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.640]   Which is like, oh man, did there...
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.520]   (laughing)
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.000]   Just, okay, for people who don't know,
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.280]   I think this is a true story about them interacting
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:29.600]   and being together for a very brief time.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:31.200]   I don't know, dating, but just connecting,
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.560]   falling in love, or in this very particular way
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.440]   that I think famous musicians, poets can,
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.640]   which is like, it's impossible
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.800]   for that kind of thing to last.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:47.040]   But they did for a brief moment.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:51.240]   There's like a sadness to it because it's so momentarily,
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:53.880]   but it's so epic.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:54.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:55.960]   - And that these two paths cross,
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:56.880]   and then you just look at it,
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.520]   we know these famous people,
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.080]   and it's interesting to watch.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.480]   - Yeah, and you don't even have the impression
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.400]   that they're thinking it's gonna last.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.560]   They more know that it's like a blaze of an intersection,
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.680]   and the limousine's already waiting
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.700]   while they're in the middle of it, and then it's done.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.340]   And he's talked about how his music,
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:20.640]   he said something like,
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.800]   some people are more inclined to say hello with their music,
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.720]   but I'm rather more valedictory.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:27.560]   That's what he said.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.400]   - What does valedictory mean?
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.140]   - Like saying goodbye, like the valedictorian's address.
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.120]   - Interesting.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:38.080]   - You know, so many of his songs really are about some form
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.940]   of parting, or goodbye, or an imperfection, or something,
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.580]   or like the broken hallelujah.
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:46.040]   - Yeah, that song.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.120]   - But the thing that's so incredible about him
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:54.720]   is the way that he's taking all of that
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.600]   and pointing it in the direction of transcendence.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:02.200]   Like it's not just pure sadness, it's sadness and beauty,
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.960]   and that's the thing.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.720]   - Yeah, there is a feeling of transcendence
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.720]   in a lot of the songs.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.600]   It's like sadness and transcendence, you're right.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:15.600]   It's a goodbye, but you're moving on to some bigger thing,
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:19.200]   but in a sort of ethereal way.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:23.460]   Like not like a proud, arrogant way.
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:28.000]   - Yeah, so his favorite poet was Garcia Lorca.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.040]   He actually named his daughter after him.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.480]   His daughter's name is Lorca.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:36.480]   And he talks about how there's some poem
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:40.400]   that Lorca had written that made him realize
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.200]   that the universe itself was aching,
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.320]   but the ache was okay because that's the way
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.260]   you embrace the sun and the moon.
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.860]   (Lex laughing)
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:51.420]   And that's what I think is,
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:55.900]   that's why I think there's this whole rich vein
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:52:00.380]   in this bittersweet tradition that he embodies
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:02.340]   that's like the essence of beauty.
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:05.260]   It's the way you embrace the sun and the moon.
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.660]   - The song "Hallelujah," I return to that often.
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:10.140]   Have been meaning to play it.
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:14.260]   I have now a friend who wants to sing it with me.
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.140]   - Are you a singer?
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:17.300]   - Hmm.
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:20.900]   (Lex laughing)
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:22.540]   When somebody says they're a singer,
[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:23.900]   do they have to be good?
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:25.100]   (Lex laughing)
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:26.420]   Because then no.
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:27.500]   But I would say yes.
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.900]   I was in a band for a while.
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:29.740]   I sang for a while.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:33.940]   I was always bad, but I enjoy it.
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:34.780]   I enjoy it.
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:35.660]   I enjoy lyrics.
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:37.180]   I enjoy words.
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:40.620]   When sung or spoken, they capture something.
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:42.840]   They could get in that moment.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.500]   Tom Waits is a huge favorite of mine for that reason.
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:51.340]   Although he often, his lyrics are often not that simple.
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:54.940]   I'd rather have a bottle in front of me
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:56.420]   than a frontal abottomy.
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:53:01.420]   He's always playing with just like these weird word play.
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:06.300]   Especially in the English language, it's trickier to do.
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.060]   I'm fortunate enough to know another language,
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.700]   which is Russian, so I get to understand
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:14.800]   that certain languages allow for more word play than others.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.240]   English, for that reason, I don't think has a,
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:23.400]   like a culture of, you know what?
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.320]   I need to push back on what I'm about to say,
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:30.240]   but there was no culture of word play
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.040]   until hip hop came along.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:37.120]   So like distorting words in interesting ways
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.540]   for there to be a rhythm, a rhyme,
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:42.320]   and at the same time, you're capturing
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.800]   some really powerful message plus humor.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.680]   All of that mixed in.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.720]   Actually, hip hop does a really good job of this,
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.000]   but there wasn't a tradition.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.160]   If you look at poetry in the 20th century,
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.600]   there wasn't really a tradition of that
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.960]   in the United States, but there was
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.600]   in other parts of the world and certainly in Russia.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:00.440]   - Interesting.
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.320]   - Empowered also, not just by the language,
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.960]   by the fact that you go through a world war
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.840]   where tens of millions of people die.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:09.720]   Something about mass death of civilians
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.800]   that inspires great literature and music and art.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:13.960]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:16.040]   'Cause you start telling the real truth, I think.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:16.880]   - Yes.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.720]   (laughing)
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.520]   There's no more reason for small talk.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.600]   (laughing)
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.440]   - That's funny.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:25.640]   I always have thought that if I could choose
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:28.540]   any other medium besides writing, it would be singing.
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:31.000]   But then-- - Are you a singer?
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.520]   - No, I mean, like I'm really not.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.460]   I just love the idea of it.
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:35.600]   But then I also think, you know,
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.240]   I'm fundamentally a shy person,
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:40.000]   so I think it's much better that my medium is writing
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:40.840]   instead of singing.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.600]   So like, it all worked out.
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:46.640]   - That said, you're also an exceptionally good public speaker
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:51.440]   and you're not supposed to be, mathematically speaking.
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.640]   - Mathematically speaking?
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.680]   - You're not supposed to be a good public speaker.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.440]   - Oh, you mean because of shyness or?
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.400]   - Yeah, because of shyness, because of introversion,
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.760]   because of all those kinds of things.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.680]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:03.200]   But lots of introverts are public speakers, actually.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.700]   Like this is one of, I knew this from the studies,
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.800]   but then also when I started going out
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.120]   on the lecture circuit, I realized that all my fellow
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.520]   speakers at all these conferences I was going to,
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.640]   they're all introverts, 'cause, you know,
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:17.200]   they're all people who like spent years
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.100]   figuring out some idea and now they're out there
[00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:19.940]   talking about it.
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:22.160]   - Oh, they're in their head figuring out the idea?
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.920]   - Yeah, yeah. - So how do you explain
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.080]   that the public speakers, would you say
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.880]   the good public speakers are usually introverts?
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.120]   - No, I think there's just different styles of it
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.640]   and I think that we just have,
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.260]   when we hear the word public speaker,
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:40.260]   we have a really limited idea of who that person would be.
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:44.940]   So for me, I used to be very phobic about public speaking
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:47.940]   and part of the reason for it was because I thought
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:50.100]   that being the kind of person I was
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:54.140]   didn't equal being able to be a good public speaker,
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:56.020]   'cause you're only imagining, you know,
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:58.840]   like the super kind of out there showman.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:02.260]   But I think there's another style of public speaking
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:06.920]   that's more reflective and thoughtful and conveying ideas
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.360]   and people like that too.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.840]   - Is there advice you can give on how to overcome that?
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:15.280]   Like if you're a shy person, how to be a public speaker?
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:18.700]   - I can totally give that advice because I used to,
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.560]   before I would give speeches, you know,
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.180]   if I had to do it in law school,
[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:24.000]   if I knew like today was the day
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.560]   when I was gonna get called on in a law school class,
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:29.360]   I literally one time vomited on my way to class.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:30.920]   That's how nervous I used to be.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:36.180]   And yeah, the way to do it is through desensitization.
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:37.700]   You know, it's like been figured out.
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:39.260]   It's the way to overcome any fear.
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:42.460]   You have to expose yourself to the thing you fear,
[00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:44.580]   but in very small doses.
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:47.420]   So you can't start by giving the TED Talk.
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:50.220]   You have to start, I started by going to this class
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:52.380]   for people with public speaking anxiety,
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:55.180]   where on the first day, all we had to do
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:58.540]   was stand up and say our name and sit down.
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.100]   I was like, that's the victory.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.700]   - That's fun to watch all those people with anxiety.
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:07.520]   Okay, that's the first step and then step,
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.760]   one step at a time.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.360]   - Yeah, and then like with this class,
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.560]   you go back the next week
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:15.340]   and he would have us come to the front of the room
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:18.840]   and stand up with other people standing next to us
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.800]   so that you didn't have the feeling
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.480]   of being all alone in the spotlight
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.400]   through others sharing it with you.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.760]   And you would answer some questions
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.160]   about where do you grow up?
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.120]   You know, where do you go to school?
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.540]   And you declare victory and you're done.
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:33.380]   And then little by little by little,
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:35.540]   you keep ratcheting up the exercises
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.900]   until you get to the point where you can do it.
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:39.900]   And then you start having successes and you realize,
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.240]   oh, you know, actually I can do this.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:46.540]   - What about like writing versus improvising?
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:47.940]   Because I knew a few people,
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:49.500]   sort of the colleagues of mine
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:50.900]   that were working on TED Talks
[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:54.420]   and it feels like you're supposed to like
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:56.820]   write the thing like way ahead of time
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:58.820]   and you practice it and they help you
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:00.300]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:02.500]   I don't think I've ever practiced a speech
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.900]   once in my life or a lecture or any of that.
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:06.580]   Like I know it's really good to do,
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:10.860]   but do you find that relieves some of your anxiety
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:13.660]   preparing well or are you now able to do
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.860]   not preparing well at all?
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:19.860]   - I definitely like to prepare before,
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:23.260]   but the kind of preparation that I've done for my TED Talks
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:25.300]   is completely different from what I've done
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:26.220]   for everything else.
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:29.460]   'Cause TED Talks are more like a theatrical event
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.460]   where it's like a one person show.
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:34.060]   And of course, if you were gonna go on Broadway
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:36.620]   with a monologue, you would know every word.
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:37.860]   So it's kind of like that.
[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:40.380]   And so I would rehearse it over and over
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:41.660]   the way you would do that.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:43.140]   - Isn't that more anxiety?
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:43.980]   - Yes. - Like knowing
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:44.900]   every single word?
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:47.260]   - It's so much anxiety because yeah,
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:49.340]   you're not even so freaked out about being on stage
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:51.140]   so much as what if I forget something?
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:52.720]   - Yeah. - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:57.020]   I mean, they do things like the last TED Talk I gave,
[00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:59.100]   I actually did forget something halfway through.
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.300]   Like I just couldn't remember the next line.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:05.620]   And so I had to walk over, like over there were my notes.
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:10.620]   And so I did that and the audience like very kindly clapped
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:13.340]   while I did that and then I came back to the spotlight
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:15.100]   and kept going and they edit that out.
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:16.900]   - Nice, so there's a failure mode.
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:18.220]   That's okay. (both laughing)
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:21.940]   But still, it seems really stressful.
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:24.900]   Like I'm now, I'm not sure if I'll ever publish it,
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:29.900]   but I've been, mostly it's for a personal journey,
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:35.700]   but I've been working on a series on, wait for it,
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:37.740]   Hitler and the Third Reich.
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:40.560]   Sort of looking at the historical context of everything
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:42.700]   because my family was so much affected
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.420]   by that whole part of history.
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:47.780]   So for me to rigorously, I've read a lot
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:51.340]   about Stalin and Hitler and for me to force myself,
[00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:53.380]   one of the best ways to force yourself
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:56.940]   to really consider material is to have to talk about it.
[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:57.780]   - Totally, yeah.
[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.460]   - And so that's why I'm doing it,
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:04.180]   but I'm playing with ideas of some of it,
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:08.540]   maybe like 20% is written down on paper,
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.300]   but the rest of it is my thoughts in the moment.
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:15.220]   And it's a difficult balance to strike
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.620]   'cause if you write a lot, you're going to be more precise,
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:20.340]   you're going to be more accurate,
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.980]   but you're going to miss some of the deep,
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:25.420]   like honest emotion.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:29.060]   The silences won't be correct.
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:32.340]   Or the silences between the words
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:36.380]   won't capture the depth of feeling.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.300]   Unless if you're somebody like me,
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.720]   if you're like, I guess that's what actors
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.380]   and actresses have to do.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:46.620]   Like basically, even though the script is fully written,
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:50.940]   you improvise between the words, between the lines.
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:51.780]   - Yeah.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:52.860]   - But that's a skill.
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:54.700]   - Well, it also takes so much time.
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:57.180]   I mean, I experienced that with the TED Talks.
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:59.540]   It's like you get to a stage,
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.940]   so you're memorizing everything word for word,
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:04.580]   and at first in that process,
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.300]   it comes out in a really wooden way,
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.640]   the way you're saying, like the emotion's gone.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.060]   But once you really know it,
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:11.780]   so you've internalized the words,
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:13.800]   then all the emotion comes back
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.860]   and you can say them in a completely different way.
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.740]   You know, and you're really speaking it from the heart.
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:21.300]   But you have to know it so well before you can do that.
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:22.140]   - It was still difficult.
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.380]   - I would never recommend it,
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.500]   'cause it's just like, it's so time consuming.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.260]   - It's an, well, in your case, it works out beautifully.
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:32.860]   Like when it all comes together, it is a theatrical thing.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.000]   It's like a musical or whatever.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.580]   I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna come out
[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:42.380]   with a one-man show on Broadway, singing.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.220]   Now I'm inspired.
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.900]   - No, but for real, where are you gonna,
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.300]   where are you gonna talk about Hitler and Stalin
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.140]   and everything you're learning?
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.020]   - On YouTube.
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:52.500]   - Have you ever thought of using the medium
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:56.780]   of just speaking into a microphone, but without the video?
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.720]   I'm curious about this,
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.960]   because like I fell in love with podcasts originally,
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.900]   before there was ever this whole video component to it.
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:09.300]   And I realized there's something so primal and magical
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.380]   about having someone's voice in your ear.
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.620]   And my favorite kinds of interviews still,
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.580]   very few people do it this way nowadays,
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:19.780]   but my favorite kind are when you're just talking
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:20.980]   into the microphone.
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:22.860]   So it's not over Zoom.
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:23.740]   It's not in person.
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.620]   It's just you and the microphone
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:26.940]   and the other person in the microphone
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.300]   and they're in your ear.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.780]   It's like the ultimate in intimacy.
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.500]   - Oh, you mean from the interviewer perspective,
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.540]   that's your favorite?
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:35.740]   - Yeah, but it would be interesting also
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:38.200]   as with the kind of thing you're talking about
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.620]   of just speaking, like just you and the mic.
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.100]   - I would love to be in person,
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.420]   but you can't see the person.
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:44.780]   I wonder what that's like.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:45.620]   - Wait, what do you mean?
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:47.140]   Like they're all there, but behind a curtain?
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:48.820]   - No, you just have your eyes closed.
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.500]   You're just talking and you have your eyes closed
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.940]   or whatever you have,
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.620]   because I think you still have to get
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:54.580]   the same kind of chemistry,
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:56.700]   'cause it's not just the visual.
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.100]   I don't even know that,
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:01.140]   'cause obviously I have trouble making eye contact,
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.060]   but I don't know if the visual stimulation
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:04.660]   is the necessary thing.
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:07.420]   There's something about the way audio travels
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:08.900]   that captures the intimacy.
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.660]   Where some people actually have headphones on,
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.300]   like Joe does this, have headphones on.
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.980]   That's really intimate.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.660]   Like there's something about that sound
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.500]   going directly into your ear.
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.320]   - Exactly, yeah.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.860]   - Yeah, there is something primal there, yeah, for sure.
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:25.380]   I've thought about it, definitely.
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:28.060]   And some of my favorite podcasts are like that,
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:31.420]   WTF with Marc Maron, that's audio only.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:34.740]   There's a few audio only podcasts that I just love.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:35.580]   What is that?
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.660]   I still go on Clubhouse,
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:42.020]   that was a social media platform where it's audio only.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.260]   It's so interesting that people,
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:46.300]   the interesting thing about Clubhouse in particular
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.500]   is people from all walks of life can tune in
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.500]   and they just have,
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.500]   somebody needs to do some research
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.020]   in terms of introversion on that one,
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:58.180]   because I don't feel any of my introvert
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:03.080]   like triggers happening.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:06.220]   Because nobody can see you, it's just audio.
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:11.220]   And nobody is offended if you're just sitting there quietly,
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:12.700]   just listening.
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:16.140]   So you can participate whenever you want or not.
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:18.180]   - Yeah, it's like the ultimate social freedom.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:19.820]   You can listen as much as you'd like,
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:21.140]   you can participate if you want,
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.740]   but you don't have to, it's no big deal.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.060]   - Yeah, because nobody can,
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.980]   if I'm actually at a physical party,
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:28.140]   somebody's gonna look at me and be like,
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.740]   why, there'll be that pressure to speak,
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:34.380]   but you don't have to in that kind of audio setting.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.060]   And there's that intimacy.
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.260]   Like you can, when it's audio only,
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.620]   it feels like you can reveal a lot more of yourself
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:43.700]   in some kind of honest way.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:44.740]   I don't know what that is.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.580]   What is that?
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:48.140]   - I don't know, but I assume it's tapping
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:49.940]   into something really ancient.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:51.880]   Like we used to tell stories around the fire,
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:56.620]   like our whole storytelling tradition was oral originally.
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:59.560]   - So maybe it's that, but we used visual stuff.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.940]   - That's true, you could actually see the person
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.780]   on the other side of the campfire.
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:05.940]   - It seems like the visual element's so fundamental
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:07.540]   to social interaction,
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:11.820]   but there is something primal about audio.
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:12.660]   I wonder what that is.
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:14.140]   And still, that's why, I mean,
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:17.360]   most people listen to podcasts, I think, audio only.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.460]   They have it in their ears while they're doing stuff.
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.020]   - Yeah, that's how I do it.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.660]   - And then there's, yeah, that's how I do it too.
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:26.780]   And that's where the friendship is formed.
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:29.380]   It's weird, the deep connection with other humans
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:32.420]   is formed because they're in your ear.
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:35.820]   And you get to see them grow.
[01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:39.420]   You get to see them be bored, experience excitement
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:42.460]   and anger and fear and all those kinds of things.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:45.100]   It's fascinating, it's fascinating.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.900]   The world of podcasting is fascinating
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:50.380]   because we're in this world of essentially radio,
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:55.080]   even though we have all this high-definition content,
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:59.020]   all this TikTok-style fast stuff and still podcasting.
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.300]   - I know, and we still choose to do this.
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:02.140]   - It's weird.
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:02.960]   - 'Cause at the end of the day,
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.520]   I think that's really what people want most,
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.260]   is just to talk to each other
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.740]   and to know what people really think.
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:10.780]   And podcasting of all the media that I've ever seen
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.500]   is the one where people come closest
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:13.740]   to telling you the truth.
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:18.460]   And to telling you the good and the bad
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.940]   and the bitter and the sweet and all of it.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.860]   - Especially long form, there's not enough time.
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:23.020]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.820]   - I had to explain this to people,
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.420]   like you talk to CEOs and stuff,
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:28.940]   they don't understand,
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.980]   they're starting to understand much better.
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:34.440]   Now as a hard requirement,
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:37.300]   with CEOs and stuff, it has to be three hours.
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:39.380]   I say, like, this is...
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.220]   - Wow.
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:42.700]   - Because there's something,
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:46.540]   they can't be doing marketing stuff for three hours.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:47.740]   They break.
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.420]   They start being human, they start joking,
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:50.460]   they start relaxing.
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:53.420]   And if they can't, that also tells a kind of story.
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:56.180]   But I do that kind of torture for CEOs only.
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.000]   Anyway.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.820]   - Yeah, when I was getting,
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:01.380]   my publishing house did media training with me
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:03.020]   before "Bittersweet" came out.
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:07.760]   And they were preparing me for the five
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.320]   to seven minute interview that you might have,
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.040]   you know, if you go on some quick TV thing
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.360]   or something like that.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.600]   And God, I hate that.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.700]   It's like, it feels like they're,
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:21.280]   you're basically having to not tell the full truth somehow,
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.040]   because you can't, you can't tell it
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.680]   in such a short amount of time.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.520]   - Well, the other--
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.200]   - So to me, podcasting is just the best thing
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.360]   that's ever happened.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.200]   - The other downside of the seven minute interview,
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:35.140]   is I think you could do a really good job with that,
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.840]   but the dance partner has to be very good.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.860]   It's actually challenging for everybody involved.
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:41.860]   It's much harder for everybody involved.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:45.500]   'Cause if you can do, you know,
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:48.300]   I can imagine like a Christopher Hitchens type character,
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.060]   who's just super witty.
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.900]   Then that you could do a seven minute thing,
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.340]   you can get to the core of "Bittersweet".
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.100]   You can get to the core of the book
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.280]   without asking those generic small talk questions.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:03.740]   'Cause too many people in that short form interview
[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:05.760]   are just asking very generic questions.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.860]   They're doing small talk for seven minutes.
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:10.980]   It's like, all right, you only get seven minutes,
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:13.500]   you only get one interesting question.
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.500]   Go ask the weirdest, the deepest question
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:20.740]   that also energizes the other person.
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:24.980]   It's an art form that people don't take seriously.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:29.140]   I think the seven minute thing, five minutes or even less.
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:31.880]   And then the commercials, which I...
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.880]   - Yeah, and I've noticed that many of the best podcasters
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.960]   are ones where when you're on my side of the table,
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:42.040]   you feel like it's more of a conversation
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.680]   and less like an interview
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.240]   where you're answering all the same questions
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.800]   you've answered a million times before.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.000]   It's really interesting how different the experience is.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.920]   - And you're right, the audio thing,
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:57.840]   if you can lose yourself in that, the intimacy of that,
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:00.640]   and you don't even remember what stupid stuff you said.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:01.480]   (Bridget laughs)
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.840]   'Cause people, I've seen that,
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.240]   I mean, people don't give 'em enough credit as...
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.880]   You might not be aware, might not be a fan,
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.520]   but Joe Rogan is an incredible conversationalist
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:17.520]   in that he makes you forget that anything's being recorded,
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.560]   that you're talking at all.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.840]   He makes you forget time and you just enjoy yourself.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.060]   And that's, whatever that is.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:30.900]   And that plugs, then you plug into that primal connection
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:31.800]   to other humans.
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:36.140]   What's your favorite Leonard Cohen song?
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:37.500]   - "Famous Blue Raincoat."
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.340]   Do you know that one?
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.060]   - Yeah, yeah, maybe I'll play it.
[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:43.620]   - Yeah, for people who don't know Leonard Cohen,
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.780]   and this is your first introduction to him,
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:49.540]   it's gonna sound so gloomy, but it's so good.
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:52.000]   - He's got this deep, rich voice.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.500]   Tori Amos covering "Famous Blue Raincoat," yeah, yeah.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.700]   No, we want the original.
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:02.180]   Just like "Hallelujah," Jeff Buckley covered Leonard Cohen.
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:03.140]   That was a really good one.
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:04.740]   - That was a really good one, yeah.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:07.980]   And I also really like Rufus Wainwright's cover.
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:10.100]   But "Famous Blue Raincoat," for people who don't know it,
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.860]   it's basically about a love triangle,
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:17.100]   and it's told from the perspective of a man
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.660]   whose wife has just been with another guy
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:23.380]   who is also his friend,
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:26.180]   and he's writing a letter to that other guy,
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.740]   and he's reflecting on the way
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:31.100]   that all their relationships have changed
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.860]   in the wake of this event.
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:36.060]   - So they're still friends.
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:38.180]   - So they're still, well, he refers to him
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.220]   as my brother, my killer,
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.020]   which is such a Leonard Cohen thing to do,
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.060]   because it's always like, you know,
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:45.960]   it's light and it's dark all at once.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:50.200]   Nothing is ever all one thing.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.780]   (gentle music)
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:55.360]   (gentle music)
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:11:02.060]   - Yeah, I love this song.
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:02.900]   - Yeah, right?
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:03.720]   I mean.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:15.160]   - He just speaks in it.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.460]   ♪ It's four in the morning ♪
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:22.540]   ♪ The end of December ♪
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:23.380]   ♪ I'm writing an out to the sea ♪
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.980]   - And the fact that it's four in the morning
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.220]   and it's the end of December,
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:28.660]   like those are transitional moments, you know?
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:30.640]   It's night going into day,
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:33.960]   and it's December going into the new year.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.260]   It's not an accident.
[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:41.980]   - There is something about December, whatever.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:44.680]   There's certain scenes you can paint in your mind.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:50.420]   There's a poem by Charles Bukowski called "Nirvana."
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:53.900]   It's a young man traveling through the middle of nowhere
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:54.740]   in the snow.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.040]   There's something about the snow,
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.420]   either the rain or the snow,
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:01.300]   puts you in a certain kind of mood that just,
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:03.580]   what is it, James Joyce, the dead,
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:06.260]   the snow is falling on Dublin.
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:09.260]   Yeah, it can put you in a place.
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:12.180]   - I mean, David Yadin, he's a researcher
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:15.580]   in psychedelics and consciousness at Johns Hopkins.
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:16.660]   He's a great guy.
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:18.740]   And he's done research that has found
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:23.060]   that when people are in their transitional moments of life,
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.660]   you know, and it could be a career change,
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:25.740]   it could be a divorce,
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:28.980]   it could be that they're nearing the end of their life,
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.300]   that they very often will say
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.220]   those are their most meaningful moments
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:35.140]   and their most spiritual moments.
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:37.500]   And so I feel like that's what Leonard Cohen
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.740]   knows how to tap into instinctively.
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:42.960]   The year after he died, his son, Adam Cohen,
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.780]   made a memorial concert for him
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:47.140]   where all these famous musicians came to Montreal
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:51.180]   where they had lived and performed his music.
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:54.220]   And my husband, who's not a Leonard Cohen fan,
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:55.900]   and he's not a bittersweet type at all,
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.540]   but he knows how I feel about him,
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.220]   he's like, "You know, you should really go to that concert."
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:02.180]   And I felt so ridiculous.
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:05.500]   The whole family went all the way to Montreal on a Monday.
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.300]   - On a Monday.
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.580]   - On a Monday, it was just like a random Monday.
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:13.740]   And we got on the plane, so like, everyone's out of school,
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.860]   just so I can go to this concert.
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:20.860]   And I got there, and at the beginning,
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:24.460]   I was feeling like, "Ugh, this was all a terrible mistake
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:28.220]   "because it's all these other musicians playing this music,
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:30.340]   "and I don't actually really wanna hear them.
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:32.860]   "I'd rather listen to him on YouTube."
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:37.300]   And then a musician named Damien Rice
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:41.740]   came and played "Famous Blue Raincoat," and he sang it.
[01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:45.420]   And he did the most amazing thing at the end.
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.620]   The whole thing was amazing.
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:49.020]   But then at the end, he sang this musical riff
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:52.340]   that was like, all I could say is
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.700]   it was like a musical lamentation of the ages.
[01:13:55.700 --> 01:14:00.700]   And the whole audience just rose silently to its feet.
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:04.620]   And it was one of the greatest moments that I've ever had.
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:06.780]   - There's sometimes certain artists in a cover
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:10.220]   can capture in some kind of deeper way,
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:13.820]   like carrying the thread of the power of the song.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:17.540]   So I've been listening a lot to Johnny Cash Hart,
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:20.140]   which is a Nine Inch Nails, Trent Reznor song.
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:22.100]   - I know, you talked about it on your podcast
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:24.860]   with Rick Rubin, which is when I reached out to you.
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:27.860]   I love that interview, and I love that song also.
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:30.400]   - Yeah, yeah, so there's that.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.940]   There's the Kennedy Center Honors
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.980]   where they celebrated certain artists.
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:35.260]   They did that for Led Zeppelin,
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:37.080]   and I forgot what her name is,
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:41.700]   but the lead singer of Hart performed "Stairway to Heaven."
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:45.300]   And it's like, if you're like, all right,
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:48.380]   you take one of the great sort of rock songs of all time,
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:51.740]   what do you do in front of, oh, the cool thing is
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:53.900]   you get to perform this in front of the artist
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.180]   while they're still there, and they're still alive.
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:58.860]   So you get to watch you sort of perform,
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:01.380]   and in that case, the president, President Obama's there,
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.540]   and she just knocked it out of the park.
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:08.540]   But at the same time, without outdoing the original somehow.
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:13.300]   - Right, you're just making it your own.
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.140]   - You're making it your own.
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:15.940]   - It's not overlapping it.
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:17.340]   - But not departing completely,
[01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:20.300]   not departing from the spirit of the original.
[01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:23.900]   It's tough because the original "Hollywood" by Leonard Cohen,
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:28.300]   it's just not, it's so powerful,
[01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:32.000]   but it's just not as good as some of these covers.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.100]   - Well, I think it's the words and the melody,
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:37.660]   and then the covers take it to a different place.
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.380]   The thing that Leonard Cohen seems to do well,
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:45.020]   I don't think he did it on "Hallelujah"
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:48.020]   because he was almost being playful on "Hallelujah."
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:52.620]   Like, I don't know, as opposed to that deep melancholy,
[01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:57.420]   like painful longing thing that Jeff Buckley did,
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:59.360]   and others do too.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.380]   - I wonder if it's because, in a way,
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:03.740]   I don't mean that he over-edited it,
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:05.980]   but he apparently worked on that song for years
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:08.140]   and went through gazillions of verses
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:10.060]   and checked most of them out.
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:12.500]   So I wonder if we're hearing his version
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.860]   after he's a little tired with that process.
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:17.660]   - Yeah, well, that's the other thing,
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:20.760]   is maybe from a book tour, you know,
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:24.580]   is you get tired of saying the same thing
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:25.580]   over and over and over and over.
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:26.420]   You forget.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.460]   You forget the--
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:30.340]   - You forget the initial, the heart of it.
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:34.180]   - Yeah, but I actually got a chance to hang out
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:38.540]   with Dan Reynolds, who's the lead singer of "Imagine Dragons."
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:43.380]   And this is an incredible band, super popular.
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:45.820]   The most played band on Spotify or something.
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:46.660]   - Is that right?
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:47.480]   - Yes.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.260]   - His went through a huge "Imagine Dragons" phase,
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.220]   so we were listening to their music a lot.
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:53.300]   - It was so surreal to be hanging out with him,
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:57.520]   and he's such a, like, very few people I've met in my life
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.980]   are just as good of a human being.
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.620]   And that has to do with the fact that he struggles.
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:04.460]   He still, I think, struggles, but he struggled
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:06.900]   for a long time with depression.
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:10.500]   And so out of that pain, you see born
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.160]   this really good human being,
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.180]   this really good relationship with his wife,
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:20.740]   like, when times are good, they lean on each other
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:23.380]   for, like, they're deeply grateful
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:24.500]   for those precious moments.
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.020]   So it's beautiful to watch.
[01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:31.020]   But he said that it's really important
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:34.580]   to feel the song every time.
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:36.280]   Otherwise, people know.
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:39.020]   People are really good at detecting your bullshit.
[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.340]   You can't fake it.
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:41.180]   - Yeah.
[01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:42.360]   - You really have to feel it every time.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.180]   You have to feel the emotion of it,
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:47.780]   whatever the emotion is, of the original time you wrote it.
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:51.960]   Yeah, it's just interesting, 'cause it put,
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.820]   I thought you could maybe fake it,
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:57.660]   but he believes personally, 'cause he played
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:59.860]   in front of gigantic crowds and over and over
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:01.020]   and over and over and over.
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:03.740]   He's like, "No, every time, you have to be there."
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:06.460]   - But there's gotta be times when he's about to go out
[01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:08.900]   and he's not feeling it, and he has to figure out
[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.380]   some way of getting himself into that heart space.
[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:12.220]   - Well, that's what he's saying.
[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:15.500]   You have to, otherwise you're just, that's the job.
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.600]   - Right, right. - Don't take the job then.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.820]   And he loves it.
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:23.320]   He says the biggest struggle, in fact,
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.900]   is the comedown from that, which is like,
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:29.020]   you have such a beautiful experience
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.140]   of connecting with this large number of people,
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:34.260]   sharing a song that you love,
[01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:37.500]   and then it's just a rush of connection.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:41.880]   And then you have to, when you get off stage,
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.900]   you're now back to normal life.
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:46.540]   And that's why a lot of musicians get into heavy drugs
[01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:47.380]   and all that kind of stuff,
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:50.200]   because you're looking for that rush again.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.140]   It's very tough to, then going to this,
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:55.740]   speaking of introvert, 'cause he probably is an introvert,
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:59.500]   is like, you have to find that calmness.
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:00.860]   And how do you find the calmness
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:03.660]   when you were just playing in front of tens of thousands
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:05.340]   of people, or hundreds of thousands,
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:08.340]   whatever that number is, that rush of connection.
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:10.540]   And everybody, there's love in the air,
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:13.260]   and you still have to find that inner peace and calm.
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:14.580]   - That's interesting, 'cause I,
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:17.500]   so I don't know if this is the introvert in me talking
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:21.700]   and the writer in me talking, but I don't know.
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:24.420]   I love most the moments where, let's say,
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:27.420]   I'll get a letter from a reader who will tell me
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.920]   what something I wrote meant to them.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:32.300]   And they'll talk about having had that kind of moment
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.860]   of the communion between the writer and the reader.
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:37.300]   And obviously I wasn't there physically when it happened,
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:39.100]   so I wasn't getting that kind of rush
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.020]   that a musician would get in a concert.
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:44.300]   But just the knowledge of that having happened
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.660]   out there in the world,
[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:48.380]   Jesus, something that I added to it,
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.420]   is the most amazing thing. - You love it.
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:54.300]   But see, imagine reading thousands of those letters,
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:56.660]   and then it's such a strong rush,
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:58.100]   and everything else doesn't,
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:01.420]   it could be overwhelming, I guess.
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:04.660]   But like anything else, you have to come down
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:06.340]   and find a calm place.
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:07.900]   Like, for example, the danger
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:10.100]   with getting letters like that,
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:11.580]   you start taking yourself too seriously.
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:15.220]   You think like you are a special person somehow.
[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:19.660]   But that's, you really wanna avoid that feeling too.
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:23.060]   - Yeah, I don't actually experience it as that much different
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.420]   from when I'm on the other side of it.
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.180]   Like, if I'm the reader,
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:29.060]   and some other writer has made me feel that way,
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:30.020]   to me it's the same thing.
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:30.860]   - Yeah, me too.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:34.740]   Yeah, it's a cool, it's a virtual hug.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.820]   - I think it's like, I was just listening to something
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:41.100]   about the different Russian writers.
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:44.780]   I was mentioning him to you, this academic,
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:46.260]   his name is Gary Saul Morsin,
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:48.740]   and he studies Russian literature.
[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:50.660]   And he was talking about,
[01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:51.860]   I don't know if I'll be able to get this right,
[01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:54.500]   but basically that the people misunderstand
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.140]   a work like Anna Karenina,
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:59.620]   and that we think of it as telling us
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:03.020]   that you're supposed to live,
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:05.900]   you're supposed to have like these grand,
[01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:10.900]   tempestuous romances that might end in death
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:12.780]   or despair or whatever it is,
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:15.940]   but you should be in it for the intensity of the emotion.
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:18.340]   And he's saying, actually, that's not,
[01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:22.420]   that's exactly not what Tolstoy was saying,
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:24.380]   that actually it was the opposite,
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.620]   that he was really making,
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:28.100]   he was really advocating for everyday life.
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:29.460]   He was saying it seems from everyday,
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.500]   like he was juxtaposing Anna Karenina
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.580]   with all these other couples
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:36.300]   who were just living happily and quietly day by day.
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:39.740]   And that was what he believed was the ideal.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:43.940]   So as opposed to the grand rush
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:46.220]   and as opposed to the intensity.
[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:49.980]   - I wonder if he, is there a depth to the,
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:52.940]   is there a romance of just the day to day?
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:55.100]   - I think there is a romance to the day to day.
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:59.420]   - And don't get distracted by the dopamine rollercoaster ride
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:01.380]   of the grand romantic notions.
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:03.180]   - Yeah, and enjoy it while it's happening
[01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:05.300]   'cause those are life experiences also,
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:08.620]   but not to mistake those for being everything.
[01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:09.900]   - Where is he from?
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:11.780]   - He's a professor at Northwestern.
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:12.620]   - At Northwestern.
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:14.180]   - And apparently his lectures
[01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:16.180]   are like the most popular on campus.
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:18.460]   - Wow, people love him.
[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:22.140]   Gary Saul Morrison is an American literary critic and slob.
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:24.140]   He's particularly known for his scholarly work
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:26.740]   on the great Russian novel lists,
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:29.300]   Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky.
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:32.060]   Morrison is Lawrence D. Professor in the Arts and Humanities
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:33.180]   at Northwestern University.
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:36.380]   Yeah, wow, and there's a lot of incredible work.
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:38.500]   And then I'm sure looking through the lens
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.460]   of Russian literature and the romance of all of that,
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.380]   he's looking at the modern world.
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:44.820]   - Yeah, I think you should have him on your podcast.
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:49.460]   - And Quiet Flows the Vodka or When Pushkin Comes to Shove,
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:51.940]   The Carmudian's Guide to Russian Literature and Culture.
[01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:54.820]   This is one of the silly books he has on the list.
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:55.660]   Okay, cool.
[01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:57.500]   What were you saying?
[01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.340]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:00.300]   - Oh no, I was just saying, yeah,
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:03.300]   I find that when I take photos on my phone,
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.580]   I hardly ever take photos at the moment you're supposed to.
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:08.980]   Everybody's gathered for some event.
[01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:10.360]   I'll forget to take the photo,
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.740]   but I take a lot of scenes from everyday life
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:14.660]   'cause that's what I actually wanna remember
[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:15.500]   in the end.
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:20.380]   - Yeah, yeah, I'm the same, the same.
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:24.980]   It's actually concerning 'cause it's bad for productivity.
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:27.500]   'Cause I love everyday life so much,
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.660]   then why do any ambitious big thing?
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:32.180]   - Your productivity is pretty good.
[01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:34.580]   I don't know that you have to worry about it.
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:35.420]   - I do.
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:36.900]   So I wanna launch a business.
[01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:39.300]   I have a dream outside.
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:41.120]   This is like a fun side thing.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:45.860]   That I wanna, there's been a lifelong passion.
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.740]   Anyway, I like building.
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:48.660]   I like building stuff.
[01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:51.300]   And I haven't been doing that as much as I would like.
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:56.300]   That's because largely, 'cause I like sitting in silence
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:59.580]   and enjoying the beauty that is just nature and life.
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:02.380]   And when there's people, there's people.
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:03.260]   I love people.
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:04.100]   I love everything.
[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.820]   And so when you love everything,
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:08.300]   why go through hell to build a company?
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:11.780]   - Yeah, it's a valid question.
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:13.740]   I mean, I think you have to have a really good reason
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:15.140]   for wanting to do it.
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:17.460]   - But then your heart calls you for the certain,
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:20.700]   sometimes you look out into the mountains and you say,
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:22.540]   "For some reason, I long to go there."
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.220]   Even if it means leaving the tribe
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:27.700]   and putting yourself in danger and doing stupid shit.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:31.540]   That's the human imperative for exploration.
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:32.840]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:36.100]   Like when we were talking about this idea of longing
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:38.740]   being like the source code of humanity,
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:42.260]   I think that's also the source code of our creativity.
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:44.580]   It's the same longing for Eden.
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:47.900]   It's like you're always reaching for something
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:50.100]   that you wanna get to or that you wanna build.
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:50.940]   - Yeah.
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:51.780]   - It's the best of us.
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:54.220]   - What do you think,
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:58.260]   you write about creativity and sadness.
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:01.860]   Practically speaking,
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:05.700]   how should we leverage sadness for creativity?
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:09.140]   Is that sort of in the artist domain,
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.180]   in the writer's domain,
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:13.260]   in the engineering domains and so on?
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:15.180]   - It's definitely in those domains,
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:16.780]   but it's in all domains.
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:20.820]   We're all gonna face pain in this life at some point.
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:25.820]   And we all have the ability to weather it and withstand it
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:29.300]   and live with it for a bit
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.980]   and then try to transform it
[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:33.220]   into something that we find beautiful.
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:40.540]   It's very easy to notice the grandeur
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:44.300]   of the painting hanging on the gallery wall
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:46.780]   or the new company that's just been created,
[01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:49.460]   but it takes a thousand different forms, right?
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:53.940]   You could bake a cake or like in the wake of the pandemic,
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:56.020]   we've had more people applying to medical school
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:57.340]   and nursing school.
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:00.140]   And after 9/11, you had people applying for jobs
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:02.940]   as firefighters and teachers.
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:05.060]   So there's something in the human spirit
[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:08.100]   that takes pain and turns it into meaning
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:09.980]   when we're at our best.
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:11.580]   And when we're not at our best,
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:14.580]   we deny the pain and then take it out on ourselves
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:15.740]   and on other people.
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:17.260]   So there's a kind of fork in the road
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:18.340]   of what to do with it.
[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.420]   But we know, I mean,
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:23.460]   there's all these studies that I go through in the book.
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:28.380]   There was one where the researchers
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:29.980]   had people watch different movies,
[01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:33.380]   like happy movies, sad movies, bittersweet movies.
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:35.740]   And they found when people watched "Father of the Bride,"
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:38.180]   which is like the ultimate bittersweet,
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:42.140]   you're walking your daughter down the aisle kind of feeling,
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:45.980]   that was, they would give them creativity tasks
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:47.380]   after watching these different movies.
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:49.860]   And the people who had been primed for bittersweetness
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:51.540]   were the most creative.
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:54.060]   And they were like primed to remember finality,
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:56.700]   you know, like love and finality, basically,
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:57.860]   love and impermanence.
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:00.300]   There's something about that
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:04.260]   that gets us to our most beautiful state.
[01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.180]   - I wonder if it is, I mean, there's studies like that.
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:07.900]   There's a, I don't know if you've looked
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:09.860]   into terror management theory.
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:11.580]   - Yeah, that's really interesting stuff.
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:15.940]   - So they especially intensely have you focused on
[01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:19.900]   not just sad, but traumatic, like death,
[01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:22.700]   prime you with death and see how that changes your mind.
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:27.860]   Like both, like, I don't know if there's creativity studies,
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:32.860]   but they have interesting, I think a little bit tainted
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:35.300]   by political bias, but maybe not.
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:37.780]   I mean, psychology is a complicated field,
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:41.820]   but they study like who are you likely to vote for
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:44.260]   if you're primed by existential,
[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:45.100]   like by thinking about death.
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:46.780]   - Like the fear of mortality.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:47.620]   - Fear of mortality.
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:49.380]   I forget what the conclusions are, but.
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:52.660]   - I think they find that people become more tribalistic.
[01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:53.500]   - Yeah.
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:54.320]   - You know, like there was one study
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.820]   where they found that after they primed people that way,
[01:27:56.820 --> 01:28:01.460]   that they would then give them the chance
[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:04.140]   to put hot sauce on a meal
[01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:06.180]   that their political opponents were gonna be eating
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.220]   and they put way too much hot sauce on
[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:12.100]   after they've been primed to worry about death.
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:16.020]   - I think at the core, we're simple creatures.
[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:17.520]   - So I actually, like in the book,
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:20.340]   I spent a bunch of time with people
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:23.580]   who are working on radical life extension,
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:26.260]   you know, or the quest to live forever.
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:28.420]   And people ask them a lot, questions like,
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:29.260]   you know, the kinds of questions
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:30.540]   you were talking about earlier.
[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.180]   Well, like how are you gonna feed everybody
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:34.500]   and how is there gonna be space for everybody
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.940]   if everyone really could live forever?
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:38.620]   And what about conflict?
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:41.060]   Won't we have an intensified conflict?
[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:42.840]   And their answer to that is,
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:46.180]   they point to terror management theory,
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:50.220]   you know, and they say, because it's the fear of death,
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:51.560]   they're basically saying it's the fear of death
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.460]   that are causing our conflicts in the first place
[01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:55.700]   and that if we remove the fear of death,
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:58.740]   we'd have less conflict to contend with.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:01.260]   And that, I don't really buy that.
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:02.740]   - It's possible that that's true,
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:05.820]   but are you also, how does the expression go,
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:08.580]   throwing out the baby with the bathwater?
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:10.860]   Are you also going to remove basically
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:15.860]   any source of meaning and happiness in the human condition?
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:18.740]   Like it's very possible that death
[01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:22.940]   is fundamental to the human condition, the finality.
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:26.060]   - Yeah, that's the great philosophical question.
[01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:30.080]   And I went to a conference of people who are working on this
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:32.380]   and I thought that they were gonna be talking
[01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:34.340]   about those questions all through the conference,
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:37.820]   but the MO is much more like,
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:39.700]   we're so happy that we're here with people
[01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:42.620]   who have gotten past all those quibbles.
[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:43.460]   - Yeah. - You know,
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.420]   and we just know there's gonna be meaning no matter what.
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:47.260]   - The basic assumption is,
[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:51.140]   let's try to extend life indefinitely
[01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:54.100]   and then we'll figure out if that's a good decision.
[01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:55.780]   - Or more like we're sure it's a good decision.
[01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:56.620]   - We're sure. - Or at least that was--
[01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:58.740]   - It's a mix. - That was what I felt.
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.340]   - It's either-- - Or what we expressed,
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:01.180]   let's say. - Sure.
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:04.860]   It's either we're sure it's a good decision
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:07.860]   or we're sure that it's good to believe
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:09.460]   that it's a good decision.
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:12.940]   Meaning like there's no downside to that,
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:14.500]   even if we find out it's wrong.
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.060]   But yes, there's a kind of certainty.
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:18.520]   Obviously you want to extend human life,
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:19.980]   that's the kind of assumption.
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:21.160]   That always seemed,
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:25.100]   now it could be true,
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:30.380]   but just like the people who over-focus
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:33.840]   on colonizing other planets,
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.980]   it feels like you neglect the beauty
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:41.340]   and the struggle of our life here on Earth.
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:43.060]   I have sort of the same kind of criticism,
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:45.200]   whether it's thinking about Valhalla
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.480]   or any other afterlife,
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:50.560]   is you can have, if you're not careful,
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:56.020]   forget to make this life a great one,
[01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:57.740]   whatever happens afterwards.
[01:30:57.740 --> 01:30:58.960]   So yeah, definitely.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:01.040]   But from an engineering, from a biology,
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.100]   from a chemistry perspective,
[01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:04.180]   it's very interesting to think
[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:05.620]   how do we extend this thing?
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:07.580]   'Cause it does seem that nature,
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:10.860]   the way it designed living organisms,
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:12.540]   it really wants us to die
[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:16.220]   because that's part of the selection mechanism,
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:19.420]   this part, this seems to be fundamental to evolution.
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:23.900]   It gets people young, they need protection.
[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:26.100]   Once they're a young brain,
[01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:27.120]   they get to explore a lot,
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.060]   get to figure out the world,
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:29.940]   they come up with their own novel ideas,
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:34.200]   how to adapt and how to respond to that world.
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:36.260]   And then as they get older and older,
[01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:39.060]   they get stubborn and stuck in their ways.
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:40.660]   And so we need them to die
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:44.860]   so we make room for new life
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:47.220]   that's able to adapt to the changing environment.
[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:49.540]   If the old doesn't die,
[01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:52.100]   then you're going to get stale
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:56.060]   and not be adaptable to the changing environment.
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:58.440]   - But maybe it doesn't have to happen so soon.
[01:31:58.440 --> 01:31:59.540]   - Yeah, maybe it doesn't.
[01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:00.480]   It's like pressing, listen,
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:04.540]   I'm a big fan of pressing snooze on the alarm clock
[01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:06.840]   in the same way.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:10.140]   I do, I'm one of the people that believe it's,
[01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:13.780]   or I don't definitely believe,
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:16.300]   of course, I don't know,
[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:21.300]   but I think death is a fundamental part of life.
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:24.940]   But yeah, if I'm on my deathbed,
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.500]   I would sure as hell press snooze
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:27.700]   as many times as possible.
[01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:28.540]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:29.380]   - I really don't wanna die.
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:30.860]   - And it's interesting 'cause in some ways,
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:34.700]   I really, I share your instinct.
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:37.100]   There was one scientist who I spoke to at that conference,
[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:38.980]   he's one of the leading advocates,
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:41.380]   and he said, "That's a story
[01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:43.940]   "that we've invented for ourselves
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:45.700]   "because we have no choice."
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:48.300]   And if you really believe that you have no choice,
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:51.420]   then it's adaptive to tell that story,
[01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:52.940]   that death gives meaning to life.
[01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:53.780]   - Good point.
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:55.340]   - But if you really think you don't,
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:57.700]   if you really think you could triumph over it,
[01:32:57.700 --> 01:32:59.800]   would you still be telling that same story?
[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:02.500]   And I've been thinking about that question ever since.
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:06.140]   - Yeah, yeah, no, they got a good point.
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:07.820]   They got a good point no matter what.
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:10.100]   As in engineering and the scientific pursuits,
[01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:11.220]   it's a beautiful one.
[01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:14.940]   In your own personal life, if we can go there.
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:16.460]   - Sure.
[01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:20.140]   - What's been some dark places you've gone in your own mind?
[01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:25.140]   Grief, loss, sad moments, moments of sadness
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:30.440]   that have made you a better writer,
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:33.500]   a better creator, a better human being?
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:38.020]   - Well, I mean, I've been through a lot of bereavement
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:40.540]   just in these last couple of years with COVID,
[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:45.220]   but even before that, I mean,
[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:46.540]   there's all kinds of stuff.
[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:48.060]   I write about it in the book,
[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:50.340]   and in some ways I feel like I can write about
[01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:53.100]   those kinds of things better than I can speak them.
[01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:55.500]   But I had a really complicated relationship
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:57.620]   with my mother growing up,
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:02.620]   where we had a kind of Garden of Eden during my childhood.
[01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:05.980]   Like we were intensely, intensely close.
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:10.980]   And my mother, because of some vulnerabilities
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:18.220]   that she had reacted with a lot of trouble
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:23.820]   to my adolescence and to growing independent from her
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:26.820]   and starting to have different religious views
[01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:29.820]   and different political views and all kinds of things.
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:34.820]   And we had a pretty intense break
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:37.940]   that I describe in the book.
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:42.300]   And it was so intense that even though after that,
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:45.540]   we still would get together for holidays
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:48.260]   and talk to each other on the phone and all that,
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:51.700]   there was a sense in which it was over at that point.
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:53.420]   The relationship was over.
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:55.460]   - The Garden of Eden was no more.
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:56.500]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:59.100]   It was like a feeling of like, yeah,
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:01.060]   like I know what Eden was like,
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:03.100]   and it's not there anymore.
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:06.900]   And I think it was all the more confusing
[01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:10.460]   'cause like if you lose someone to actual bereavement,
[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:12.900]   you go through a mourning process
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:14.580]   and people have thought for thousands of years
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:15.860]   about how to do that.
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:18.020]   But with something like this,
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:18.860]   there's no process
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:20.820]   because you're not even admitting to yourself,
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:23.700]   especially when you're like in your teens and 20s,
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:25.220]   that you're mourning something.
[01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:30.220]   So, but it was the case that for decades,
[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:33.620]   for decades, I could not answer
[01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:35.260]   even the simplest question about my mother,
[01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:36.740]   like where did she grow up,
[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:38.260]   without tears in my eyes,
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.900]   or more than tears in my eyes,
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:42.700]   like embarrassing tears.
[01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:45.940]   So I would just try to steer the subject in another place.
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:51.220]   But I will say, two things happened.
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:54.260]   One is that I've spent the last six, seven years
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:57.140]   writing this book about joy and sorrow
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:59.340]   and loss and love and all of it.
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:02.620]   And I've really come to terms with all of it.
[01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:05.300]   And then the second thing that happened is
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:07.580]   my mother now has Alzheimer's.
[01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:12.020]   And in her Alzheimer's,
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:14.260]   she's still actually the same person.
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:15.740]   Like she's forgotten most things,
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:17.500]   but she still has these conversational lanes
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:18.500]   that you can travel down
[01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:21.100]   that are like the way she always was.
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:24.980]   And the way that she was when I was a kid,
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:28.820]   which was like so incredibly loving and so connected
[01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:32.780]   and so warm and sweet and funny and all of it,
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:36.100]   all the things I remembered, like it's all come back.
[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:39.420]   And for all these decades,
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:43.900]   I had been wondering whether that Garden of Eden
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:46.500]   I remembered had actually happened,
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:50.100]   or whether that was just like the fantasy of a child
[01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:53.340]   and maybe it was always difficult and I had not seen it.
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:56.060]   But I'm seeing her now,
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.020]   and I realized that it was all true.
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:00.500]   Everything I remember, it was all true.
[01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:02.740]   It all happened 'cause it's happening again.
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:09.180]   - And you returned to the Garden of Eden for a time.
[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:11.020]   - Yeah. - And to childhood.
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:12.540]   It's always a question
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:15.140]   of whether you can return to that place.
[01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:15.980]   - Well, I don't know.
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:17.380]   I don't even know if I'd say I've returned
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:19.220]   because I'm a different person now
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:22.660]   and I don't need her. - Are you sure?
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:23.580]   Are you sure? - Yeah.
[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:28.380]   - You're different than the 10-year-old?
[01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:29.620]   - Well, okay. - You feel different?
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:31.220]   - No, I mean, I'm the same person
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:34.380]   in terms of my need for love and love of love
[01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:37.280]   and all of that, but I don't look,
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:41.780]   I'm not dependent on my mother for it the way I was then.
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:43.940]   And that makes the experience really different.
[01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:48.940]   - Yeah, when you're younger, she's a god figure.
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:50.100]   What is that? - Yeah.
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:52.100]   - The roots to parents.
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:54.860]   Such a funny civilization we live in.
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:56.820]   There's a depth of connection to parents
[01:37:56.820 --> 01:38:00.580]   that's probably more powerful than anything else
[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:03.220]   in terms of its formative effect on who you are.
[01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:04.840]   - I think it's the most powerful.
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:08.420]   And in fact, when this started happening,
[01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:11.260]   I got to college and I took a class in creative writing
[01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:13.860]   and I tried to write a story, a fictional story,
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:16.080]   a fictionalized version of what was happening.
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.020]   And I called it "The Most Passionate Love"
[01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:20.180]   because of what you just said.
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:21.380]   - Yeah.
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:23.100]   - And the teacher actually said to me,
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:25.540]   she was like, "You should put this story in a drawer
[01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:27.680]   "and not take it out again for 30 years
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:29.460]   "'cause you're way too close to it."
[01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:30.700]   - Yeah.
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:33.380]   - So I've now finally written it 30 years later.
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:39.820]   - Yeah, you're probably still too close to it though.
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:41.060]   (both laughing)
[01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:41.900]   - I don't know though.
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:46.900]   I mean, I do think everybody goes through experiences
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:49.140]   in this life where you're experiencing
[01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:53.780]   a fundamental pain of separation and desire for a union.
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:56.500]   And it takes so many different forms.
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:58.500]   And this was my primal form of it.
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:02.700]   But for someone else, it's a betrayal or a bereavement
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:05.140]   or an exile from a country of their birth
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:06.100]   or whatever it is.
[01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:09.340]   - And then you get to solve that puzzle
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:12.300]   for the rest of your life.
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:15.340]   - Yeah, the fact of like, I really do believe
[01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:19.700]   that the original love that we long for,
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:21.320]   like that one of the great things that you learn
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:24.980]   as you grow older is that the love exists
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:27.420]   in some plane that's more general
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:30.300]   than the particularized form in which you first knew it.
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:31.580]   - Yeah, I mean, that's why,
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:33.660]   despite all the creepy interpretations,
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:39.420]   even though Sigmund Freud is probably wrong in the details,
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:42.060]   he was the first one to sort of suggest that
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:44.500]   our experiences, I mean, he said
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:47.540]   that that was really controversial at the time
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:50.140]   when young people, they start having sexual thoughts
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:53.120]   like at age two or something, whatever the hell he said.
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:55.900]   So you develop this kind of connection
[01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:58.180]   to the opposite sex or whatever,
[01:39:58.180 --> 01:39:59.900]   to your mother, to your parents.
[01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:04.180]   And I think while a lot of that is shown
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:08.860]   to be probably not true, what is like a deeper truth there
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:11.220]   is your first early experiences of love
[01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:13.900]   or depth of connection are probably somehow
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:18.100]   strongly formative of your conception of love
[01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:21.380]   and your definition of the perfect thing
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:23.620]   you're reaching for for the rest of your life.
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:25.140]   - Yeah, I think that's right.
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:28.300]   And you can really see it when you become a parent too.
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:30.940]   You know, you can just see like there's--
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:32.700]   - Don't screw it up.
[01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:35.980]   - You know, I have to say, I mean, knock on wood,
[01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:38.300]   I actually feel like we're doing pretty well.
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:39.940]   Like my kids are teenagers now
[01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:44.220]   and I really had thought that I wasn't gonna repeat
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:45.780]   the issues that I had been through with my mom.
[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:48.040]   And I can say, I really am not.
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:52.980]   Yeah, like my mom for various reasons
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:55.900]   just had a lot of trouble with my independence
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:58.060]   and I just don't feel that at all.
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:40:59.180]   So--
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:02.020]   - Yeah, there might be other things
[01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:03.340]   you're totally blind to.
[01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:05.020]   - I guess that's possible.
[01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:06.700]   - Isn't that the way of parenting
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:08.900]   is you solve the problems of the past
[01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:10.380]   but there's always gonna be a new one.
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:11.220]   - But there's some other new one.
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:13.140]   I guess I'll find out in 10 or 20 years.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:14.860]   But like so far so good.
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:18.340]   - What wisdom about parenting can you give
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:20.740]   from your own experience and from your writing?
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:24.300]   - Yeah, well, oh my God, there's a lot to say.
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:27.500]   So on the bittersweet side of things,
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:29.540]   the wisdom that I would give is
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:35.780]   that especially for kids who are growing up
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:39.200]   in relative comfort with everything going pretty well,
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:45.500]   they get the idea that real life
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:47.440]   is when things are going well.
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:49.020]   And when things don't go well,
[01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:51.460]   it's like a detour from the main road
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:56.020]   as opposed to understanding that it's all the main road.
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:59.540]   And I tell this story in the book of this time
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:01.940]   that we went on this family vacation
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:04.180]   where we rented a house in the countryside
[01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:07.180]   and the house was next to this field
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:11.140]   where lived two donkeys that our kids fell in love with.
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:13.940]   They were like really little at the time, two boys.
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:16.260]   And they're spending all this time
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:18.940]   feeding carrots to the donkeys and it's all beautiful.
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:20.760]   And then comes the day where they realize
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.260]   that we're leaving in like two days
[01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:24.900]   and they're never gonna see these donkeys again.
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:27.260]   And they start crying themselves to sleep.
[01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:30.300]   And the usual things that parents might say
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:32.340]   at a moment like that of like,
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:35.700]   maybe we'll come back or another family will feed them,
[01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:37.020]   we'll feed these donkeys.
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:39.540]   None of that made any difference.
[01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:44.180]   But when we said to them, goodbye is part of life
[01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:49.180]   and this feeling you're having, everybody has it.
[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:51.980]   You've had it before, you're gonna have it again.
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:53.920]   You'll feel better in a couple of days,
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:58.140]   but this is the way it's supposed to be, this is natural.
[01:42:58.140 --> 01:42:59.540]   That's when they stopped crying
[01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:03.820]   because I think that's when they stopped resisting.
[01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:04.660]   - Yeah.
[01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:07.140]   - Like it's one thing to feel the pain of goodbye
[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:08.980]   and it's another thing to be feeling like
[01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:10.740]   this isn't supposed to be happening.
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:13.620]   It's the resistance part of this isn't supposed
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:16.660]   to be happening that makes life really difficult.
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:17.500]   - Yeah.
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.620]   - As opposed to a more clear eyed view of what it really is.
[01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:21.540]   - This is indeed supposed to be happening.
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:23.020]   There's a show called Yellowstone
[01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:25.020]   that I recently started watching.
[01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:26.220]   - Yeah, no, I've heard of it.
[01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:28.940]   We actually started watching it, but only a few minutes
[01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:29.940]   and didn't get into it.
[01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:32.580]   - So there's just a quick, it's not a spoiler of any kind,
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:36.060]   but there's a father taking out the son for the first time
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:39.860]   to go hunting and to shoot their first buck.
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:44.340]   And the son is really sad because he pulls the trigger
[01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:47.740]   and he took a life and the father says
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:51.660]   that everybody gets killed in this life.
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:52.980]   That's the way of nature.
[01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:57.060]   That's the way each one of us is going to get killed.
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:44:01.260]   And it's interesting because I didn't really think of it
[01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:03.580]   that way because you think you die,
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:06.220]   but he really framed it as killed.
[01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:10.340]   Because he's like, there's no such thing
[01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:11.980]   as dying of old age.
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:14.380]   Let's medically, let's discuss that a bit.
[01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:16.420]   But basically there's something,
[01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:21.420]   whether it's a truck or a bacteria,
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:26.500]   something's going to kill you in the end.
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:28.820]   And that was an interesting way to look at it
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:31.580]   because we tend to think of humans
[01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:34.100]   aren't supposed to be killed.
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:35.780]   We think of murder as one of the sins,
[01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:39.580]   sort of one of the things that you don't do in society.
[01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:40.580]   But you know what?
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:43.060]   We do, that's a more technical discussion,
[01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:46.620]   whether we ultimately get killed by something in the end.
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:49.420]   But to some degree that's true, at least for most of us,
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:50.660]   that there's something that gets us,
[01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:53.660]   whether it's cancer, those kinds of things.
[01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:54.860]   It's interesting.
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:58.340]   But yeah, that reframing of it's supposed to be,
[01:44:58.340 --> 01:44:59.700]   this is the way of the world.
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:01.300]   - Yeah, so it's funny.
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:03.900]   I mean, at the same time that I just wrote a whole book
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:06.100]   about the fact that this is the way it is.
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:08.140]   Like I really do believe this is the way it is.
[01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:11.700]   And with this reality, there's an intense beauty
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:13.580]   that comes along with it.
[01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:16.140]   So we have to accept the reality to get to the beauty.
[01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:17.020]   I believe that.
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:19.140]   And at the same time, there's a part of me
[01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:22.620]   that's just like, yeah, but give me the magic wand
[01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:24.380]   to make the world different.
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:25.220]   - Yeah.
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:27.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:29.860]   - I don't know how much of this is a female thing too.
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:31.820]   Like I was watching with my son,
[01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:33.420]   my 12 year old the other day,
[01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:36.320]   we were watching this show about the battle of Thermopylae.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:37.160]   (laughs)
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:40.180]   And it was like all about, you know,
[01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:43.460]   valor and glory on the battlefield.
[01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:46.780]   And I said to him something like,
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:49.380]   gosh, don't you just wish we lived in a world where
[01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:53.740]   you didn't have to do all this in order for everyone
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:55.500]   just to live their lives?
[01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.820]   And he just looked at me completely puzzled.
[01:45:57.820 --> 01:46:01.580]   Like, no, you know, like to him it all just seemed
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:04.700]   self-evident that the world would be structured that way.
[01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:07.060]   You know, and he had like the 12 year old's
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:09.740]   like admiration for the valor of it all.
[01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:14.740]   - But you wonder if that's nature or nurture.
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:19.160]   I wonder what that world looks like.
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:23.540]   We do live in a world where murder is seen as bad,
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:27.220]   but you look at a lot of the human history,
[01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:30.880]   I don't know if they had the same kind of conception of that
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:35.220]   in terms of, you have to ask what kind of murder,
[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:38.140]   you know, for what purpose?
[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:40.040]   You know, war was a way of life.
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:42.500]   It's interesting.
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:47.500]   It's interesting if we can imagine properly a future
[01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:52.140]   that is different than ours in terms of operating
[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:53.780]   under different moral systems.
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:58.300]   I'd like the same with living indefinitely
[01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:00.660]   or living in a society with no war.
[01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:04.260]   Like how fundamental is war?
[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:06.220]   How fundamental is death to humanity?
[01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:08.660]   - I think it's so fundamental to our source code.
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:11.300]   I just wish that our source code were different, basically.
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:13.980]   Like I can't get past that wish.
[01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:17.560]   - There's brain-computer interfaces that try to merge.
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:21.300]   So greater and greater, where smartphones
[01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:23.140]   were already kind of cyborgs,
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:26.920]   but greater and greater merger of computational power.
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:30.620]   So literally adding source code to our original source code,
[01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:33.500]   just a different, there's the mushy biology
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:35.020]   that runs source code,
[01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:39.860]   and then there's more cold electrical systems,
[01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:41.380]   and then they integrate together,
[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:45.060]   and potentially one day we offload
[01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:50.540]   the magic that is human consciousness also into the machine,
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:51.420]   and then we'll get to see.
[01:47:51.420 --> 01:47:54.340]   Maybe they'll be a little bit less asshole-ish
[01:47:54.340 --> 01:47:56.100]   about the whole war thing.
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:57.080]   There'd be more.
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:02.500]   But there is, I think, even when I think about engineering
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:05.920]   human intelligence or superhuman intelligence systems,
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:10.060]   I feel like they also need to have the yin and yang of life.
[01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:13.740]   They have to be able to be afraid and to be sad
[01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:15.460]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:18.740]   But maybe it's because I'm a product
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:19.900]   in this particular environment.
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:24.580]   Maybe sadness is a useful human invention,
[01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:26.540]   but not a universal one.
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:27.660]   - This is what I don't know,
[01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:29.940]   'cause this is where I come back to the,
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:31.980]   as I told you, the original reason
[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:34.420]   that I wrote my whole book was the feeling
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:37.900]   that somehow in the expression of sad music
[01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:41.420]   is what other people see when they talk about God.
[01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:42.820]   Like there's something so,
[01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:46.540]   there's like an ultimate beauty there
[01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:49.140]   that I don't know if we have access to without that.
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:50.000]   But maybe we do.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.260]   But I can say in this world,
[01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:55.460]   it's a great way to get access to that state.
[01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:56.860]   - Is it within the reach of science
[01:48:56.860 --> 01:48:59.500]   to deeply understand this, you think?
[01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:02.660]   To understand why you feel sad when you're listening to a song?
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:04.200]   - Or why you feel so much love
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:05.620]   when you're listening to a sad song.
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:06.660]   - To a sad song, right.
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:11.660]   Why the sad song opens up some kind of deep connection
[01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:16.060]   to something you can call divine or something,
[01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:17.380]   whatever the heck that is.
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:19.060]   - Yeah, I do think.
[01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:22.180]   I mean, we have like really early signs of it
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:24.860]   from the research and I'm sure we're just at the,
[01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:27.020]   scratching the surface stage.
[01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:28.820]   But I mean, like we know, for example,
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:32.860]   that the vagus nerve, which is so fundamental
[01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:35.700]   that it governs our breathing and our digestion,
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:38.380]   that our vagus nerve also activates
[01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:41.220]   when we see another being in distress.
[01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:44.940]   There's like an instinctive impulse to wanna make it stop.
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:49.340]   And the theory is that that's an evolutionary design
[01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:51.620]   because we had to be able to respond
[01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:54.180]   to the cries of our infants.
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:57.060]   And from that ability grows the greater ability
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:49:59.740]   to respond to other people's cries too.
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:04.740]   So that's probably just the very first step
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:08.540]   in being able to understand what all that is.
[01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:10.300]   - We've already given plenty of advice,
[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:15.300]   but broadly, what advice would you give to young folks today
[01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:17.620]   about career or about life,
[01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:22.380]   whether they wanna be writers, lawyers, scientists,
[01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:25.340]   musicians, and artists, whatever the heck they wanna be,
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:27.940]   how can they live a life they can be proud of?
[01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:29.380]   - Okay, here's what I think.
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:36.580]   You should absolutely do that thing
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:38.460]   that you're dying to do,
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:42.460]   but you should always have a plan B,
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:46.420]   like a backup plan and a way of earning a living
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:48.020]   no matter what happens.
[01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:49.980]   Because I feel like people,
[01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:54.020]   we have this narrative in our culture
[01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:57.980]   of like that the glamorous thing is to figure out
[01:50:57.980 --> 01:51:02.300]   the thing you love and then risk everything to achieve that.
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:04.580]   But first of all, a lot of people aren't comfortable
[01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:05.860]   with that level of risk.
[01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:09.340]   And second, when you're living with that level of risk,
[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:10.980]   that's a cognitive load too.
[01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:14.340]   And so you don't have the full emotion and heart
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:15.700]   to be able to focus on the thing
[01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:16.740]   that you actually really love
[01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:18.900]   'cause you're like stressed out about it.
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:21.140]   So I'd say like get the backup plan in place
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:22.540]   and then do the thing.
[01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:25.620]   - My advice would be the opposite.
[01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:27.860]   - Huh, okay, tell me why. - I'm living the romantic,
[01:51:27.860 --> 01:51:32.860]   well, I think the best, the truth is be aware of the cost
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:39.780]   not having a plan B has, so do it deliberately if you don't.
[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:43.180]   But I'm with Bukowski on find what you love
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:44.780]   and let it kill you.
[01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:48.220]   I think you have to actually know your personality.
[01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:53.220]   I know if I have a plan B, I will not try as hard on plan A
[01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:56.820]   and I would likely take plan B
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:59.060]   'cause if plan A is the risky thing,
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:04.900]   I just work way much better when in the state of desperation
[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:06.900]   so with my back against the wall.
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:08.220]   And you have to know that about yourself.
[01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:09.060]   I think that has to do with--
[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:10.540]   - So I think we can refine it to say
[01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:12.460]   you actually have to really know yourself
[01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:15.020]   and how you respond to different kinds of risks.
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:17.660]   Like I would not do well in that kind of situation.
[01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:20.780]   I'd be like up at two in the morning worrying about it
[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:22.980]   whereas if I have some,
[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:25.060]   like it doesn't have to be paying the rent in some grand way
[01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:28.420]   but if there's some basic way of paying the rent,
[01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:31.340]   then my heart's free to do the thing I really love.
[01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:32.900]   - That's hilarious.
[01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:37.580]   For me, the only way I'm free is when I don't know
[01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:38.980]   how I'm gonna pay the rent.
[01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:46.020]   'Cause otherwise I'll find a way to pay the rent
[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:48.920]   that's not at all a source of deep fulfillment for me.
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:52.860]   - I see, so it's like if you don't have the,
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:53.860]   what's the expression?
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:56.340]   I don't know, something like the dog at your back.
[01:52:56.340 --> 01:52:57.180]   - Deadlines. - Then you won't
[01:52:57.180 --> 01:52:58.000]   actually do it.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.340]   - I create real or artificial deadlines,
[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:01.620]   anxiety and so on.
[01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:04.580]   Yeah, you have to know yourself.
[01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:07.340]   - Yeah, so really the advice is know your triggers
[01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:09.980]   but we're still saying the same basic thing
[01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:12.460]   of like do the thing you really love
[01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:13.940]   but just set up the--
[01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:14.780]   - Strategize the rest. - The rest of your life.
[01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:17.380]   - Appropriately to your personality and triggers.
[01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:18.860]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:21.020]   - What do you think is the meaning of life?
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:23.460]   The meaning of this whole thing?
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:29.180]   Probably has something to do with whatever we feel
[01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:31.260]   when we listen to a sad song.
[01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:36.260]   - Yeah, 'cause two things come simultaneously to my mind
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:37.680]   when you ask that question
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:39.960]   and I've been asking it since I was four.
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:41.560]   I remember the first time I did.
[01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:45.040]   - The question is more important than the answer probably.
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:46.960]   - Yeah. - Just keep asking.
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:48.520]   - I don't know, the first one is beauty
[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:50.640]   and I don't know why beauty's so important
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:52.000]   but I just know that it is.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.520]   - And possible to define perhaps.
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:56.080]   - Is it definable? - Yeah.
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:54:00.000]   - Other than you know it when you see it.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.360]   I don't know, I mean just--
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:06.280]   - Has to do with that line that you feel something
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:08.400]   when you just see it or you hear it.
[01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:11.840]   - Yeah, you just see it and it's like some,
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:15.840]   it's whatever can deliver you to that mode of transcendence
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:18.840]   where you're no longer purely in your own self
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:22.520]   and you're in something higher.
[01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:25.280]   And when you're in those states of mind,
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:30.400]   you know it because you have the temporary sensation
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:33.320]   that you could die at that moment,
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:36.120]   that the people you love could die and it will all be okay
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:37.840]   because there's something else.
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:41.160]   So that's my first answer.
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:46.160]   And then my second answer is the need to relieve psychic pain
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:48.320]   like other people's psychic pain.
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:51.440]   I don't know why, that's just like an impulse that I have.
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:55.240]   - Psychic pain is more like suffering of any form.
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:58.160]   What is psychic pain? - Yeah, but I mean.
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:54:59.520]   - What, is there a particular--
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:04.520]   - Yeah, just making the world better and less pain.
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:08.040]   Less pain to go around in general.
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:12.160]   - Hence your sort of optimistic desire and longing
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:15.680]   for a world without sort of destruction,
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:19.440]   without malevolent destruction.
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:22.120]   - Yeah, a world where that wouldn't be necessary.
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:24.480]   Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:26.680]   But yeah, so I had this moment.
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:30.120]   It wasn't so long ago, I was doing some interview
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:33.800]   and somebody asked me, what are you longing for right now?
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:38.000]   And my answer at that moment was like, you know what?
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.760]   I'm actually at this moment in life
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:41.720]   where I'm not longing for anything.
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:43.120]   I'm at this particular way station
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:46.120]   where everything is the way I want it to be.
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:51.000]   Of course, the minute you say something like that,
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.320]   you know you're gonna be proven wrong
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:57.000]   because like an hour later, I get a letter from a reader
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.640]   who I've been in touch with over the years
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:02.600]   and he was telling me about like a psychic struggle
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:03.520]   that he's going through.
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:06.840]   And I just felt like, oh my gosh,
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:08.960]   if there were anything I could do to make it
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:10.960]   that his life wouldn't have been such
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:13.200]   that he would be in this position in the first place.
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:16.660]   Like his struggles had to do with a long life history.
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:22.200]   So I don't know why I feel that so intently, but I do.
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:24.960]   - Those moments when you are just at peace,
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:26.800]   there's nothing else you want,
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:30.200]   feel like that's like a temporary repose, like a pause.
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:31.040]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:37.760]   You bet your ass a desire follows that at some point,
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:39.680]   but you get to enjoy those little moments.
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:42.880]   - Yeah, and even when he asked me and I answered that way,
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:44.240]   I said, this is a way station.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:45.860]   Like I knew it was temporary,
[01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:47.640]   but I didn't realize it would be disrupted
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:48.620]   like an hour later.
[01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:54.600]   - And sort of to give you pushback to your statement
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:59.600]   about the possibility of, you said beauty
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:02.940]   and basically alleviating suffering.
[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:04.940]   There's a quote I really like from Hunter S. Thompson
[01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:06.740]   that pushes back against that,
[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:09.180]   which is for every moment of triumph,
[01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:13.820]   for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:17.060]   But that's a very Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:19.020]   And you know how he ended up.
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:22.660]   He's not the greatest philosopher of all times,
[01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:26.700]   but he's certainly a beautiful, a chaotic human being.
[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:27.540]   - Well, that's true.
[01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:29.880]   And I will tell you that my nickname for my husband
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:32.620]   is Gonzo, kind of because of him.
[01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:35.120]   You know, he invented that form of Gonzo journalism
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:40.120]   where like the writer is totally in the story
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:42.100]   and my husband, like that's his personality.
[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:44.000]   He's like in everything that he does.
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.020]   He's really in it.
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:46.140]   He's really present.
[01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:47.300]   He just lives that way.
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:50.740]   So his name is Ken, but I call him Gonzo
[01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:52.140]   like 90% of the time.
[01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:55.520]   - Well, then that's a beautiful way to end this season.
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:57.020]   This is, thank you for your work.
[01:57:57.020 --> 01:57:58.620]   Thank you for being who you are.
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:01.940]   Thank you for initially at least making me feel okay
[01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:04.220]   about being an introvert and educating
[01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:07.100]   and making the rest of us feel great about being introverts.
[01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:09.380]   It's like half the world or whatever the heck it is.
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:10.420]   It's a lot of people.
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:13.420]   Thank you for being you.
[01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:14.260]   And thank you for talking today.
[01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:15.340]   This was awesome.
[01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:16.180]   This was fun.
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:17.020]   - Thank you so much.
[01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:18.420]   It was so great to talk to you.
[01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:20.740]   And I think it was the, what I said to you
[01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:22.280]   when we first got connected is thank you
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:24.060]   for your way of being in the world.
[01:58:24.060 --> 01:58:26.100]   I really, really love it.
[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:28.580]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:29.980]   with Susan Cain.
[01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:31.140]   To support this podcast,
[01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:33.860]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:35.880]   And now let me leave you with some words
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:37.560]   from Susan Cain herself.
[01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:42.420]   The highly sensitive introvert tends to be philosophical
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:44.860]   or spiritual in their orientation
[01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:48.860]   rather than materialistic or hedonistic.
[01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:51.020]   They dislike small talk.
[01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:54.780]   They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive.
[01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:57.900]   They dream vividly and can often recall their dreams
[01:58:57.900 --> 01:58:59.340]   the next day.
[01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:04.060]   They love music, nature, art, and physical beauty.
[01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:06.620]   They feel exceptionally strong emotions,
[01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:09.300]   sometimes acute bouts of joy,
[01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:12.620]   but also sorrow, melancholy, and fear.
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:15.380]   Highly sensitive people also process information
