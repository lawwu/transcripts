[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   Welcome back to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.120]   And today's question comes from me.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.720]   Yes, from me.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.880]   Pastor John, this is a question I wrestle with.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.520]   Of course, the biblical pattern for our week is set in creation.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.940]   Work six days, rest one day.
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.160]   But here in the United States, we live on a five-day workweek with two days of non-work,
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.520]   which is, I think, a rhythm that apparently was invented by Henry Ford to encourage workers
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.960]   to work only 40 hours a week so that they could consume more.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.460]   So here's the question that I have.
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.940]   Should Christians work on Saturday, too?
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.120]   How should we reconcile the creation pattern of working six days with our American practice
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.440]   of working five days?
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.840]   Well, let me take this as an occasion to step back and say something about my understanding
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.320]   of the Sabbath, because that's part of what's going on here in that question.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.640]   And then I'll tell you what I think about six days of work.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.640]   Sounds good.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.480]   I'm not a strict Sabbatarian, which for me means two things.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.920]   I think the New Testament shifts the Lord's Day from Saturday to Sunday because of the
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.840]   resurrection calls it the Lord's Day in Revelation 110 and says that they were meeting on the
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.240]   first day of the week in Acts 27 and so on.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.160]   Number two, I don't take the Old Testament command to keep the Sabbath as binding on
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.680]   the church today with the same strictness that it had in the Old Testament for several
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.680]   reasons.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.760]   One is the way Jesus dealt with the accusations he received of his disciples breaking the
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.060]   Sabbath, like in Matthew 12, where they're plucking grain.
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.460]   And instead of saying, "No, they're not really breaking the law," instead of saying that,
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.100]   he goes back to David's eating the showbread, which he says was not lawful, and the priests
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.440]   in the temple.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.840]   And then he says, "I tell you something greater than the temple is here.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.460]   If you'd known what it meant when it said, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice,' you wouldn't
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.780]   have condemned the guiltiness.
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.640]   The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.000]   That seems to me Jesus' way of loosening the strictness of Sabbath-keeping, as long as
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.320]   people are replacing it with allegiance to him and his way, and he becomes their Sabbath.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.600]   And the other reason that I say he's loosening things up is because of the way Paul deals
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.000]   with it in Romans 14, where he says, "One person esteems one day better than another,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.640]   and another esteems all day alike.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.000]   Let everyone be fully convinced in his own mind."
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.200]   And Galatians 4, where he says, "You observe days and months and seasons and years, I'm
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.760]   afraid I've labored over you in vain."
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.200]   And Colossians 2:16, "Therefore let no one pass judgment on you with regard to a new
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.720]   moon, festival, or Sabbath," and so on.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.720]   These are shadows.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:05.480]   So it looks to me, my take on this very controversial issue is that the Sabbath restrictions in
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.760]   the Old Testament are loosened, but I do think I'm impressed with the fact that the early
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.440]   church didn't do it away with it entirely, because they met on the first day of the week,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.920]   they called it the Lord's Day.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.560]   It is rooted in six days of creation, as you pointed out.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.820]   It's not rooted merely in ritualistic practices in Israel, it's rooted in the way God made
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.360]   the world and how he rested on the seventh day.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.560]   So my view is, with a lot of flexibility, we should keep the Lord's Day for rest and
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.720]   for worship, for spiritual renewal and physical renewal.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.560]   What it implies, I think, and here I'm not going to make a law, just like I don't want
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.760]   to make a strict law out of Sabbath-keeping.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:01.400]   I'm impressed with the way the Old Testament set up work six, rest one, and specifically
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.040]   Exodus 20, verse 8, "Six days shall you labor."
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.640]   We usually think of Sunday being the command, "Don't work," but really the command is, "Do
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.400]   work," six.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.680]   Exodus 34, "Six days shall you work," and on the seventh rest.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.640]   Deuteronomy 5, 13, "Six days shall you labor and do all your work."
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.000]   So all my ministry, I've assumed I work six days.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   That's what I just assume.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.480]   I work six days, I rest one.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.240]   So I would take a day off, Monday or Thursday, as a pastor, and try to really take it off
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.120]   in a very restful way, since Sunday was a very stressed out and hard day.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:49.640]   Now having said that, that I'm a six-day kind of guy, here are seven qualifications that
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.480]   make that difficult to apply.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.760]   One, house, car, computers, garden all require work, not just vocation.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.160]   So to say that you go to work five days a week might mean your Saturday is fixing the
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.760]   car or fixing the door or the faucet or cutting the grass, I mean, just to make life work.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.640]   You've got to do lots of work besides what you do in your vocation.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.640]   Number two, secular vocation may be one form of life ministry, and neighborhood and school
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.620]   or civic or church ministry might be another.
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.300]   So a person might only work four or five days on his so-called vocation and then have another
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.400]   day of work in his ministry, in his civic life.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.600]   Third, the ambiguity of what a workday is figures in here.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.040]   Like if you work 10 or 12 hour days, it raises the question whether you have already worked
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.680]   six days in five days.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.360]   Number four, for some of us, it's not easy to distinguish work and leisure.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.920]   If I'm sitting on the couch reading a biography, am I working?
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.000]   Well, it might depend whether I'm taking notes or what does it really depend on?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.640]   I mean, I love my work and so it's hard for me to distinguish and that has to be taken
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.640]   into account.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.600]   Fifth, there is real possibility that a person may work six days because he is in bondage
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.880]   to work.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.640]   He's into ego, he's into finance, he's into escaping home, and that would make working
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.960]   six days sin.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.640]   Or it may be that a person wants to work as little as possible because he's lazy, hates
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.920]   his work, and so that would make him working five days a sin.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:42.760]   Sixth, in Christ, work is sanctified so that aspects of the curse that came on work have
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.960]   been removed and it can be joyfully and satisfying as we do it in Christ's name, whether it's
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.520]   five or six.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.400]   It's not like there's big drudgery in six.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.440]   There doesn't have to be at all.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:02.440]   And lastly, the last qualification of my advocacy for six is in the new age that we've already
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:10.040]   entered into in measure, Christ has become our eternal rest.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.960]   There is a soul rest, a Sabbath rest that we found in Christ, which means pervading
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.360]   all of our work.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.200]   Five, six, four days we are restful in Christ.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.000]   So when all is said and done, Tony, here's my...
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.240]   The question is, have we found the rhythm of work and refreshment that points to the
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:43.280]   greatness of the risen Christ and that leads to strong faith and sustained joyful energy
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:50.800]   for fulfilling all the various callings, plural, that a person has to the glory of God?
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   Brilliant.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.600]   Those are very helpful categories in thinking through our work weeks.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.720]   Well, tomorrow a listener wants you, Pastor John, to explain the watershed differences
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.840]   between Calvinism and Arminianism to a teenager.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.560]   That should be very interesting.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.200]   Well, for everything you need to know about this podcast and to send Pastor John your
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.680]   question, your carefully crafted, concise, and specific question, go to desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.440]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.120]   We'll see you tomorrow.
