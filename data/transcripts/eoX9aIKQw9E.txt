[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620]   what I've heard about Google is that every meeting above a certain size has a
[00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.620]   DEI person in it. I mean, literally. Probably right.
[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.020]   So it's kind of like in the days of the Soviet Union, their military,
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.600]   the red army in every division or unit,
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.500]   there would be a commander or Lieutenant and there'd be a commissar and the
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.020]   commander reported up the chain and the commissar reported to the party and the
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.160]   commissar would just quietly take notes and all of the meetings of the unit.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.500]   And if the commissar didn't like what the Lieutenant was doing,
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.980]   Lieutenant would be taken out and shot. That's kind of a dramatic example.
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.420]   But the point is that in every large meeting at Google,
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.500]   you've got this DEI commissar who's like quietly taking notes.
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.320]   I'll point out that at Google,
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.660]   the only person we can ever remember to get fired was James Damore,
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.700]   who was an engineer who complained about the political bias at Google. In other
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.780]   words, he was a whistleblower about the very problem that's now manifested.
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.740]   If you're sitting in those meetings with a DEI commissar present and you know,
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.700]   or you have suspicions that the AI product is not working right,
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.780]   are you really going to speak up and risk the fate of a James Damore?
