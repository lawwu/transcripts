[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   Josh mentions this in the report itself, but because of, you know, an aging workforce with
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.240]   baby boomers retiring, and then, you know, decreased fertility rates, you know, more
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.440]   people out of the workforce, and losing the skills of the future, potentially not reskilling
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:29.440]   and upskilling themselves. We're, employers are at a loss of, of employees and the labor
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.520]   is in high demand, and it's likely that this is going to stay for the future.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.760]   Well, thanks. Josh, was there an epiphany or kind of a turning point in your research,
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.320]   and your company is always doing research, that inspired you to call out the scarcity
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.600]   of talent as one of the biggest challenges that's out there for companies?
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.680]   Yeah, you know, I'll tell you this, the way that we came to this, you know, as Sonia knows very
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.760]   well, the typical equation that you learn in business school about the labor market is,
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.280]   when the unemployment rate goes down, the inflation goes up. When you reduce inflation,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.600]   and you slow the economy, the unemployment rate goes back up again, because we have surplus
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.840]   workers. So, you know, I've, I've watched that cycle for years, and, you know, there's all these
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.200]   charts of how it's gone in the past, but over the last four years or so, from the pandemic on,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.240]   because we talked to so many companies, we heard the same thing over and over and over again.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.960]   We don't have enough people, we don't have enough skills, the retention is a problem,
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.800]   we don't know where to source them, people are leaving. And then you look at the effect of this,
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.560]   you know, sort of highly empowered workforce has, and we have employees saying, I'm going to quietly
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.800]   quit, I'm going to work my wage, I'm going to do what I need to do, I don't care what you say.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.000]   SWB Audio Capture not registered.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.840]   I can work remotely. This is a completely different situation. So as I looked into it,
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.640]   and I looked at all the data, if you look at the World Bank, they have all this information on the
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.080]   future demographics of different countries. And you find out it's really surprising, but every
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.600]   major country is going to peak in working population in the next decade to 15 years.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.400]   So economy aside, and I think there will be economic fluctuations for sure. I think this
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.000]   is a long term, excuse me, secular in that sense, trend that we're going to just have to deal with.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.480]   And I see this going on. And I think a lot of companies think, well, you know, we're just
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.840]   going to put more money into recruiting, and we're going to spend more money on
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.520]   waitfold or whatever it may be. You got to be smarter and smarter and smarter about finding
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.320]   people and taking care of the people you have to really grow your company. One more point, Steve.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.040]   You know, if you think about, you know, sort of that problem of not having enough people,
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.120]   you know, the solution to that is not working harder and harder and harder to hire.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.240]   It's making the people in the company more and more productive. And so there's this other
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.400]   countervailing sort of narrative that, you know, most of us were trained that the way to grow the
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.600]   company is to hire more people. Well, I don't think that's going to be true. I think that's
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.080]   going to be a piece of it. But we're going to have to look at ways to upskill people,
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.760]   move people into better jobs, automate and improve business processes. And that's really
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.640]   the world we live in. And that's what the story is all about to me.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.480]   Well, in the real life example of that sounds like, you know, the tech tech companies during
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.680]   the pandemic just went crazy hiring and oops, that does not that was not a path to hire,
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.080]   hire profitability, I guess. By the way, we'll be putting a link in the chat space to Josh's
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.760]   report at the end of the webinar so you can all get access. But first, we have other things to
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.280]   cover. What are some of the early warning signs or symptoms of the challenge we're going to be
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.440]   facing like labor shortages in different industries that might be kind of proving the case in small
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:20.160]   ways? Yeah, I think you you nailed that. nailed it on the head is that the right phrase?
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:31.520]   skilled labor shortages are what we're going to expect for sure, especially in areas like
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.240]   healthcare, specifically with nurses, with technology, green technology in particular,
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.400]   I know semiconductors is some work that we've done on and it's likely that with all these new
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:51.440]   technologies, the people will need to be upskilled and reskilled. In this rapid evolution of new
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.880]   technologies and specialized skills will need to be attained. And, and that's okay, right? Because
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:07.040]   I think companies now will need to focus on their employees and will have to focus on the reskilling
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.280]   and upskilling of their employees. So that is something that we're going to be looking at.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.840]   In addition, we'll be looking at perhaps higher turnover rates if employers don't focus on their
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:27.200]   employees. So we're seeing that with retail, hospitality, customer service industries that
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:34.560]   we saw, especially during the pandemic. And in the latest jobs report from the BLS in October,
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:44.320]   we saw that these industries aren't hiring, like hiring increased, but it was not across all
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:51.120]   industries. And so we're seeing the ebbs and flows and increased employee turnover in certain
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.120]   industries as well. Steve, can I point out one point here? Yeah. There was a report. I know you
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.120]   used to work at the BLS. There was a BLS report that came out just a couple of weeks ago.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.560]   Not registered. And I think they said that 50% of the new jobs that are expected to be created
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.480]   are in healthcare. And that is the number one employer in the United States and it is growing
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.240]   as a percent. So one of the other things we're dealing with is, you know, we're all living longer,
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.000]   but we're not living longer alone. We need a little bit of help.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.200]   I mean, whether we're aging or not, we're living, you know, many, many more years, but, you know,
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.920]   we got to go to the doctor more often. There aren't enough doctors. All the medical facilities
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.120]   are getting bought up by private equity companies. They're all combining. There is a huge shortage
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.400]   of clinical professionals. So whether we, you know, want to hire AI engineers or software
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.080]   engineers, whatever, there's this huge population missing in that segment that is almost dwarfs
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.720]   everything else. So, you know, every industry has got their shortages, but that one is just
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:05.840]   massive and it's going to get worse. And you mentioned so many relevant industries,
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.720]   assisted living will be a big thing. And a lot of that work has to be done in person. It can't
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:18.480]   necessarily be automated. So those people will probably get paid more too. So, but does this all
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:26.240]   go away if we have the much talked about, but slow arriving recession, does that change things?
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.680]   Josh, you made an allusion to the business cycle. You know, I've been, I've been trying to get a
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.840]   hold of Paul Krugman or one of these big shot, you know, guys to see if they'll talk to me about it.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:40.160]   And I've talked to Peter Coy at the New York times about it. Yeah, of course, if we have this,
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.920]   if we have some sort of a massive recession, there'll be unemployment, but first of all,
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.240]   it doesn't look like we're going to have one of those. But I don't think that changes this
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:56.160]   long-term issue. And I don't think CEOs and CHROs should run their companies expecting there to
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.280]   be a certain type of an economic environment. They have to run their companies for the long run.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.480]   And they have to just, you know, kind of think about this issue because
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:13.760]   people, in fact, that's the time I don't want to hire people. So I've got to figure out a way to
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.720]   plan for this, this sort of environment that I live in. And that's really, you know, the way I
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.360]   see it. So I think there'll be blips, but I don't know, Sonia, unless you disagree, I think this is
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:31.360]   a long-term issue. Agreed. It's definitely a long-term issue unless somehow we open up
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:37.120]   immigration drastically. I know that was curbed during the pandemic and it's starting to pick up
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:44.000]   again too, but it's really that, you know, there's all of these openings, businesses want to do more.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   They want to come out of this pandemic and they're really in this mode of doing more,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   innovating more across departments. And how do you do that without the people there? So
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.600]   in one way or another, whether it's like AI to assist people or it's getting more people
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:13.920]   through the doors by being more flexible and having better policies, workplace policies,
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.520]   all of that stuff. That's going to be the key, I think, in the future.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.080]   Yeah. And just one thing on workplace policies, I mentioned that Steve, tomorrow we're going to
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.840]   introduce a big research report we just finished on the four-day work week. And, you know, believe
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:36.320]   it or not, it sounds wacky, but this is becoming a big deal. And not just, you know, because people
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:42.560]   want to go home on Friday and go to the dentist, but because employees want the flexibility and
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:50.400]   we're actually finding that this particular idea creates job productivity and job forces companies
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:58.240]   do job redesign. So there are things that we're going to do that seem unnatural now to deal with
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.560]   this shortage that are going to be commonplace in the future. And that's just one example to me.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.760]   Now, does that mean when you say the four-day work week, you don't mean-
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.120]   SWUP audio capture not registered.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.160]   It's interesting. It's really interesting. You guys should all read up on this. It's called
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.840]   work time reduction. And what's been going on is a long time ago in the, I don't know,
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:26.160]   20, 30 years ago, companies tried four days of work for four days for five days of work
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:32.800]   and people got burned out and didn't really work out. So this new idea is let's keep the
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.240]   company business the same. Let's pay people the same wages, but tell them they have 32 hours.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.440]   And you know what they do? They get rid of the junk work they didn't want to do anyway. They
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.920]   get more focused. They stop going to stupid meetings. They spend more time thinking about
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.600]   what they're accountable for and they end up getting more work done. So anyway, I don't want
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:11:00.560]   to get too off that topic, but to me, that's an example of the kind of thing that sounds strange
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.440]   that we're going to do more of in this new economy.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.880]   You think either one of you think that it could actually be kind of a motivational
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.520]   development for people to embrace technology to get the boring work done and like, okay,
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.880]   I have to invest time to learn this, but it'll help me get out on Friday.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:25.840]   Yeah, exactly. I think I am coming out with an ink piece later this week or next week.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:31.840]   And I talk about how working parents, I'm a new parent myself, and how you really have to be
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:38.640]   cautious of your time and you end up learning to do more in less time because your time's limited.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:45.920]   So in actuality, you're more productive. And just from an econ point of view,
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:53.920]   how do you really define productivity? And in the textbooks, it's output per worker,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:00.000]   which is like how many trinkets can you make in an hour? But then if you think about it in today's
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:09.760]   day and age, I think it's revenue per employee. And that's a way that service or corporate settings
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:18.400]   can really look at how effectively the company is utilizing its human resources to generate revenue.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:26.240]   And so I think that will be a key to determining for employers to see if this four-day work week
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:35.040]   will work. And again, it'll be a sign that you can compare with competitors and old management
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:41.600]   where, like we said, hiring more people isn't necessarily more productive. It's how much
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.840]   people-- it's how the people you have, how productive they are.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.360]   I was going to say--
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.000]   Go ahead, Josh.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.520]   --on the topic of productivity. So there's kind of two sides to productivity.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:01.520]   There's the individual becoming more productive. And I think there's a hilarious video you're
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:07.360]   going to see on the website that I'm posting tomorrow of a very, very, very famous TikToker
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:13.920]   who started a theme called Lazy Girl Jobs. And it's a hilarious video about how she gets all
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.680]   her work done in two days so she can take her dog for a walk. And she doesn't tell her boss
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.800]   that she's using all these AI tools to do all this work. And then there's organizational
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:30.160]   productivity. And that's really where we come in, is how do you organize the company and move
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:36.800]   people around and plan roles and use technology so you're not just hiring, hiring, hiring?
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:46.080]   Because as Sonia said, the sign of a poorly run company is low revenue per employee. Right now,
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.760]   that's a sign of a company that's basically going to be at risk, in a sense. And that takes
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.800]   engineering, change management. And one of the things we did, we've done all this research with
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:02.960]   Eightfold in different industries, is the companies that are really good at improving
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:08.000]   productivity-- by the way, including health care companies-- are very good at human resources.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.200]   They're good at training. They're good at facilitating workshops, redesigning jobs,
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:20.320]   flattening the corporate hierarchy, changing the role of leaders, democratizing training and career
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:27.040]   development. These kind of touchy-feely things that felt like nice-to-haves maybe 10 years ago
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.240]   are sort of critical now to becoming more productive in this new economy.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:42.000]   Well, which I think connects to another question that I had, which is, Josh, you touched on how
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.680]   we got here in terms of the agrarian age, industrial age. But what are some of the
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:54.560]   information age ways that workers and leaders were developed? How did those pipelines change and
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:03.600]   evolve? Well, I mean, the big shift that is sort of underneath all this is this shift from what I
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:10.560]   call from jobs to work. In the industrial model of companies, which we all live in, there was a job
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:16.960]   title, a job level, a job description, and it was basically a box. And the reason it was created
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:23.920]   was that we can swap people in and out of that box. And that is all a leftover artifact of industrial
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.000]   business. It actually comes back-- by the way, it comes from slavery, actually. The slave trades
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.040]   operated like this. Well, now we're in sort of companies where the individual skills are used
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:42.320]   for many things. They may be in a role or a job title, but in a given day or a given week or month,
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:46.560]   they're doing many, many things besides what might have been written down in that job.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:52.640]   So these rigid job descriptions and job titles and job hierarchies are getting in the way of
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.680]   reorganizing and redesigning the company to be more efficient. So-- and this is, by the way,
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.960]   one of the things Eightfold does, really helps people with in this tool for organizational
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:10.480]   intelligence, but is simplifying all of these old job artifacts so people can move to new roles more
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:16.640]   quickly. There's a lot of resistance to that. Managers don't want to give up their job titles.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.200]   They don't want to give up their-- [AUDIO DESCRIPTION]
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.680]   That's getting broken down more and more and more. And that's just sort of an existential
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.600]   change in the way companies are going to operate, certainly over the next decade.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:37.840]   - And just to add to that, I think moving from job descriptions to skills-based
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:45.920]   work will be the future. So really looking at-- if you're looking at talent acquisition,
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:52.160]   you're looking at what skills do I want from this person or the ideal candidate today?
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:58.240]   And then, yeah, maybe you're not finding that out there. But then you look at adjacent skills and
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:05.040]   how people can be upskilled and reskilled to get to what you want. And that opens your pool
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:11.360]   significantly. And that's something that Eightfold really does really well. And I think we have
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:17.840]   a really good system in place to show how adjacent skills are from one another.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:25.440]   And you can do that with TA. You can do that with TM. There's so many ways to look at skills this
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:33.040]   way. And it really opens up, I think, what the future of hiring and looking at your workforce
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.600]   will really look like. - Can I just give you an example of this?
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.440]   Because I have a very specific example. So one of the first studies we did with Eightfold was in
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:47.040]   health care, where there's this massive shortage of clinical professionals. And what they now do
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:54.240]   in health care, where the nursing is usually the critical talent issue, is they look at what a
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:01.840]   nurse does. And if you're taking out the trash, cleaning the floor, scheduling another nurse,
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:08.400]   filling out prescriptions, that's not your job. You're overskilled for that. So they take that
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.440]   stuff that's getting in the way of you doing nursing work, which you're paid to do, which
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.680]   they call working at the top of your license. And they either automate it or they find other people
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:23.840]   to do it. And they only can do that-- - SWB Audio capture not registered.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:30.240]   - --in these different roles. So as Sonia said, as we become more skill-centric in the way we run
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:36.160]   companies, your job's not going to mean-- the job title's not going to mean as much. I mean,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:42.560]   I remember interviewing an engineer at a software company a couple of years ago in San Francisco.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.240]   And they were going through this issue where one engineer is stuck over here and he can't go work
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.320]   on this because his boss won't let him go. And the head of HR said, we're doing away with that.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:56.800]   All of you engineers have a new job title, engineer, period. You're all fungible. You
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.360]   can work on a lot of stuff, and we're not going to lock you into this group or that group anymore.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.680]   And I think that's going to be the way companies are going to have to deal with these issues. And
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.960]   it'll be good for people, too, because workers and individuals can just do more with their careers
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:19.200]   over their lives when they have this flexibility. - Yeah. I mean, just-- sorry to interrupt. Just
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:27.440]   another point on that is if you break down the hierarchies and you really look at the skills
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:34.880]   that an individual has and you look at the needs of an organization, you can kind of put employees
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:43.760]   in specific goal-centric projects, kind of like consulting does. Instead of just having you siloed
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.320]   to one department, you can now move around to where you're needed based on your skills. And I
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:56.880]   think that is a great future idea for companies because employees would also get the most benefit,
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:05.200]   and companies would be able to really have employees that are well-versed in the whole
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:12.720]   enterprise. - The question I was going to ask as a follow-up was, as skills proliferate,
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.840]   that taxonomy of skills that are needed and how much they're needed and how they rise and fall,
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:24.320]   would seem to not only take computational power to sort those out, but constant input, right?
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.720]   - SWP Audio Capture, not registered. - Learning or something just in your
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:35.280]   particular company? - Well, this is sort of the miracle of products like Eightfold. People used
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.280]   to think-- so the old way of thinking about skills is we had this thing called the competency model,
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.160]   and we literally did it by hand. And we wrote down all the competencies, and we put it in a book,
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.320]   and then we said, "Okay, lock that, and let's just say, 'Okay, we're done. Let's go do something
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:55.120]   else.'" This is different. This is a constantly changing, never-ending sort of data system
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:02.800]   that's figuring out what the new skills are. And if you look at a new domain like AI,
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:08.960]   I don't know all the hundreds of skills under AI. I'm not sure anybody does. I think you need AI to
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:14.720]   know what those skills are. And there's going to be new inventions every day. And so what we can do
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:20.160]   with tools like Eightfold is we can start to look at what are the trending technologies or business
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:27.280]   practices or domains or functional areas that are growing in our industry. And we can say, "You know
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:32.080]   what? We either do or don't have people that know that stuff, so let's get some development to move
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.720]   into that direction, or maybe we'll hire some people that we can find that know more about it."
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.440]   And that's just a level of intelligence we never had before.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:48.240]   Yeah, it's pretty phenomenal. They're using AI and machine learning in order to look at these
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:54.240]   skills. So you bring in all of this billions of data points, and it's pretty neat because you can
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:22:03.120]   tell what a software engineer at Google does has difference and how a software engineer has
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:09.920]   at Facebook. And their skills are actually different because the algorithm knows what
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:17.280]   exactly they're working on and therefore what their skills are. So yeah, getting rid of the
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:23.760]   titles and really looking at what you're actually doing and what you're skilled at is pretty
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.800]   phenomenal. Another interesting example of that is Chevron.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.280]   [AUDIO PLAYBACK]
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.240]   SWP Audio Capture not registered.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.240]   Chevron, a couple of years ago, we helped them with some stuff where they were trying to figure out
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:41.440]   what skills they needed to get into mining of materials for batteries, solar energy,
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:46.320]   natural gas they already understood. So they have petroleum engineers and various different
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:50.880]   kinds of manufacturing, refinery, and so forth. So they said, "Let's call it an energy engineer."
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:57.600]   What the heck is an energy engineer? I mean, I studied mechanical engineering in college,
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.640]   thermodynamics. So they went through and they posted a bunch of jobs. Nobody applied.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.840]   And they thought, "Well, we've got to get smarter at this." So after using Eightfold and some other
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:14.160]   tools and looking at some data, they figured out what were the scientific domains they needed to
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:20.400]   hire to fill these jobs because there were no job titles that even defined what the jobs were.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.800]   And now they're filling the roles and they know what they need. But if they didn't have that
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.960]   skills intelligence, they wouldn't have been able to fill those roles.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:36.720]   Sonia, let's talk about demographics for a moment. Things are changing fast
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:44.000]   in terms of workforce participation. People like me, baby boomers, our line chart is going down
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.560]   and folks like my two sons, their Gen Z people is going up, lines are crossing. What kind of
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.920]   trends like that do you see? How will that affect the labor shortage?
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:03.440]   I touched on this briefly, but we're seeing an aging population. We're seeing declining birth
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:12.560]   rates. And then we're also seeing a shift in skill requirements too. So it'll be more important than
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:22.960]   ever before to focus on lifelong learning, to have multi-generational workforces in the workplace.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:33.600]   So I think it's important that if an experienced worker wants to continue to work,
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.560]   employers should look at their skill sets and try to hire them because they do bring
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:47.920]   a lot with them and a lot of knowledge with them. And that diversity in terms of age will really set
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:54.240]   those employers apart. And then on top of everything else, I think it's also, there's
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:00.160]   going to be policy and workplace adaptations that we're going to need to reconsider and rethink about
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:10.640]   like retirement and pensions, age-friendly workplaces. And then for everything, like
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:16.160]   everything I just talked about, there's going to be economic implications for all of that. So
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.160]   on productivity and then innovation and automation and all of that.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.800]   You know, another one, let me add, Steve, on that question real quick.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.920]   Another thing that's really changing that I don't think people think about enough is the
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:37.280]   economic model of the, I'm a baby boomer too, was you go to college, you get your degree,
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.760]   you got your skills, you go to work, you do it for about 30 years, you retire.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:50.640]   Now you live to the age of 100 or 110, you work for 60 years, your college degree is ancient
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:56.480]   history. I don't even remember what I did. I'm not sure it's even relevant. In fact, I need to go
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:03.360]   back to school about five times during my career to keep up. That's a completely different economy.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.120]   And the educational institutions haven't figured out what to do yet because they're worried that
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.800]   they're not going to have enough kids. So, you know, one of the other things that's changed is
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:19.200]   lifelong education and companies are pouring money into programs and certificates and education and
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.320]   L&D to try to deal with that. And that's a totally different way of thinking about careers and the
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:33.360]   economy and the workforce as well. >> I think what we could talk about now is what leaders should do.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.800]   >> SWP audio capture not registered. >> We've touched on this a little bit, but
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:46.800]   you know, how, well, we could talk about workforce planning too, because Josh, you're --
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:52.000]   >> We have to. >> You said that it's a mess. So we'd like to know about that and love to get
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.680]   your take on that too, Sonia. >> Let me talk quickly about leaders. There's a couple of
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.800]   questions about employee development and careers too. So one of the pieces of research we just
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:06.640]   published that came along with the post-industrial age sort of kit was what we called irresistible
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:14.240]   leadership. And, you know, there's been probably 50,000 books on leadership and tons and tons of
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:22.080]   IP out there and lots of courses and stuff. But the big thing that's changing is leaders have to
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:31.680]   understand this shortage, you know, existentially and operate in a company where transformation
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:39.680]   and growth isn't an episodic thing. It's never ending. So it used to be, you know, you were kind
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:44.400]   of in a job and you were measured by your ability to execute and hit the numbers and whatever. And
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.480]   then every now and then there was a transformation, then you'd go back to your job. Now
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:54.720]   everything's transforming on a continuous basis. And so the new model of leadership is can you
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:00.960]   build a company that can move people around, that can develop people, that can hold people
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:08.000]   accountable, but also give them the opportunity to move when you need them into a new place.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.240]   Those are different kinds of leadership skills than, you know, Jack Welch had at GE in the
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:21.040]   those kinds of books. So there's a totally different kind of a leadership sort of mindset.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:26.560]   The other issue on leadership is when you have a flattened organization, you don't need so many
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:32.560]   leaders. You don't need so many levels. So everybody becomes a leader. And if we're all
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.880]   working on cross-domain projects and different initiatives here and there, sometimes I'm a
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.120]   leader, sometimes I'm a board member, somebody else is running the project. So we have to
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:46.560]   democratize the concepts of leadership to more people. You know, people my age, Steve, you're
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.920]   probably around my age. I mean, we measure our success by how, you know, would I ever get promoted?
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.920]   You know, and if it took me 10 years to be promoted, I felt like I was falling behind.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:01.200]   Well, that's not really going to be the model anymore either. You know, maybe your growth is
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:06.400]   going to be by the level of skill you have and the level of contribution you make, and maybe the
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.360]   amount of money you make. And your level may not ever change, never be that significant. Maybe you
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.680]   won't need to have a whole organization working for you. So there's a lot of interesting changes
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:22.160]   in leadership and leadership development that are part of this. Just one other thing.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:31.120]   Yeah, along with this talent mobility is something that I think we're going to see more of individual
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.800]   contributors, like Josh just mentioned. We see this in tech at the moment. And what they really
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:42.000]   do is instead of managing others, they're focusing on their own work. And we're probably going to see
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.840]   more of those people. People will have, instead of moving up the ladder, there will be no ladder,
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:55.840]   it's going to be, yeah, what areas of the company have you worked in? What picture,
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:02.880]   like holistic picture can you bring to the table, your skills, your ideas, your appetite for
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:09.680]   innovation? I think all of that will be really important. And how should, shifting from leadership
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.000]   in general to specifically HR, and a lot of people in our audience are HR leaders with
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.800]   different, in different disciplines. How should HR be different from like being a cost center,
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:26.640]   an administrative center to something more like planning, development, things like that?
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:32.880]   How can that evolve? Well, this is a huge topic and this is another big study we're launching
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.560]   the week after next. So we've been working on this, of course, with lots and lots of companies
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:43.440]   about their HR functions. And there's a couple of big changes that- SWB audio capture not registered.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:52.560]   The history of HR, of course, is that HR was the administrative function that managed the hierarchy
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:57.680]   and the bureaucracy in the industrial organization. And it was the compliance function and it was the
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.680]   function that managed pay and some of the fundamental legal issues. Well, now that we're
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:10.720]   a talent driven company and a talent short sort of environment, HR has got to do a whole bunch
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.960]   of different things. It's got to understand where the skills are, where the skills are going,
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:21.760]   it's got to focus on building skills. They have to interconnect the silos of HR. One of the things
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:28.560]   that happened to HR is HR got sort of inadvertently designed around what I call the 1980s IT
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.720]   department. We have a group over here that does diversity. We have a group over here that does
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.560]   recruiting. We have a group over here that does pay. There's a group over there that does something
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:40.720]   else. They don't, they're kind of all little COEs. That's all got to get interconnected.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:48.640]   You know, the HR professionals themselves have to be cross-trained and up-skilled. You know,
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:53.520]   HR people are very smart, hardworking people. They want to understand AI. They want to understand
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.240]   org design. They want to understand pay equity. If they're not in the pay group, that doesn't
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.920]   mean they don't need to understand it. So there's cross-training inside of HR. We call this systemic
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:11.440]   HR, which is thinking of the HR function itself like it's a big professional services organization
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:18.240]   with services and technologies, but also able to move and initiate new projects and bring
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:24.640]   groups together to work on challenges that come up in the organization. And you know, my experience
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:30.000]   with HR people over the years is they're itching to do this because they've, I mean, we used to
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.320]   talk about the fact that HR didn't have a seat at the table because nobody would listen to what the
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   HR people were saying. Now that the CEO is saying, hey, you know, you over there in HR, help me fix
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:46.720]   this skills thing, reorganize the company and stop AI and work with IT, you're all of a sudden
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:55.200]   the HR people are thinking, wow, okay. So there's a lot of stepping up going on in HR. We call this
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:00.960]   systemic HR because it's really thinking of HR as a system with lots and lots of skills and
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:07.040]   capabilities that can be deployed in different ways in companies. And it's a very exciting time,
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.520]   you know, for people like me that are in this domain. Well, it's very, it seems like very
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:16.480]   forward-looking just, you know, I grew up in a fortune 500 company and HR was usually associated
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.840]   with conflicts and problems and what happened. And this is pitching in a different direction
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.480]   and what will seem like a great way. And on this issue of workforce planning, just let me just
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:32.320]   mention it, I'll turn it over to Sonja. So you would think that with all these shortages and
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.520]   skills issues, that's workforce planning would be a central issue. It actually is a part of HR that
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:44.560]   is very much behind. It's in most companies, it's a headcount planning, budgeting process.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:49.280]   And so I think, you know, over the next couple of years, companies are going to get a lot smarter
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:55.360]   about skills to skills-based planning. If you look at, for example, in the aerospace and defense
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:00.960]   industry, where the companies, you know, the big companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing,
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:07.360]   they're very dependent on the skills they have to meet the needs of billion-dollar government
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:12.560]   contracts. They don't wait for a government contract to come and then go hire a bunch of
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:18.320]   people. They are sniffing around all the time, trying to figure out what skills they're going
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:24.960]   to need to address the next big procurement. Most companies aren't very good at that. And so
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:30.080]   this idea of skills-based planning and skills-based workforce planning is definitely going
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.360]   to become part of the whole new domain. >>
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:39.040]   So do you want to add anything? And then I think we'll go to our audience questions. You've got a
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:44.240]   bunch of excellent ones. >> Sure, yeah. Two things to add. So one,
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:54.080]   on the HR front that you asked about earlier, I think HR wants to and will need to be more
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:35:00.880]   strategic. So being more actively involved in business planning and aligning HR strategies
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:09.360]   with business objectives. Like Josh mentioned, they're now being asked by the C-suite for these
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:16.960]   things. And that really, I think, means embracing technology and data analytics. So how can you
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:28.080]   use data to predict workforce trends or for TA, for TM, for performance? How can you use data in
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:35.040]   everything that you are thinking of today and for the future and for your advantage? And so I think
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:42.160]   that's where eightfold-- I'm a little biased here, but that's why eightfold is really great
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:50.720]   at what we do and what we can help with. And you can bring not just the data from your own company,
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   but from millions of data points and make better decisions with it. So just wanted to add that.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:09.200]   And then in addition, in terms of the Boeing example that you gave, another point of research
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:18.560]   that we did recently at eightfold was looking at when airlines had laid off their workforce
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:25.600]   during the pandemic, all of the skills that they lost during that time was significant.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.880]   And then trying to hire back those people, but they had already moved on to other industries
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:39.200]   or other jobs. It was, as you all have probably seen, a catastrophe when rebooking systems and
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:45.600]   flights being canceled and not having those customer service representatives that knew what
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:54.240]   they were doing. So from the beginning, we talked about when you have a surplus or think you have
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:37:00.720]   a surplus of employees and you lay them off, it's not necessarily for the best. When you leave
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:08.560]   when you lose that crucial experience and knowledge as well. So just another point.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.880]   Yeah. And we just have proof of your point. We just had, I think the busiest travel day in
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:18.160]   US history and the airlines just came roaring back and needing every single person.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:22.320]   You know, on the topic of layoffs, there's been a lot of studies done that show that companies
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.880]   that go through massive layoffs end up losing more money than gaining in the long run because
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:32.560]   the recovery process is so difficult. Sometimes they go out of business too. So layoffs are tricky.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:39.760]   I think it was a Harvard business review study that said, even though a company might think it's a
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:48.720]   cost effective way to reduce their bottom line or help their bottom line, it ends up in the long
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:57.040]   run, actually hurting them because of employee morale of those who stayed and all of that
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:04.880]   reputational distress as well. All right. Thanks. Well, let's go to some questions from our
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:13.280]   large audience. Hannah asks, with the increased utilization of AI to improve employee efficiency,
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.760]   what are your thoughts on navigating the potential biases embedded in AI? And
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.000]   I think Sonia, it's probably something your company has thought about a lot.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.480]   Yes. Yeah. Thank you. So Eightfold is doing a great job with this. I'll give you an example
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:37.280]   with talent acquisition, at least. So, you know, you are looking for the perfect candidate.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:44.560]   You are trying to be as diverse as possible here. And the algorithm really tells you
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:53.040]   like how to pick the most diverse candidate. And if you, for example, are a woman and you don't
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:39:00.480]   meet all of the bullet points in a job description, you're less likely, studies say, that you're going
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:08.480]   to apply for the job. But then if you're using, if the company you're applying to is using Eightfold,
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:16.400]   it actually tells you like you would be a great match for this job. And that increases
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:24.080]   more applicants and increases diversity that way. On the flip end, you know, if you're a recruiter,
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:32.240]   it helps expand the talent pool and really zero in on who you're looking for. And with the skills,
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:41.120]   expanding skills, you can expand your talent pool as well. So all around, it's just doing great
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:47.600]   stuff for DEI. You know, just on that issue of bias, I mean, the reason that Eightfold is able
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:54.080]   to do that, by the way, is because it's amassed a huge amount of data and it has a basically a
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:40:01.840]   giant sample of human beings to look at. The risk of AI is having a small data set that actually is
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:08.960]   biased. So when you start building your own AI systems and using AI on some of your own company
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:16.000]   data, it's going to be biased based on the employees you have. Like if you ask your, you know,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.200]   internal system like Workday, who's likely to be promoted, it's going to look at all the people
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.960]   that are promoted. They're all white males and it's going to look for more white males.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:30.800]   So that's where the risk is, is not having enough data and really, and that's why, you know,
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.800]   Eightfold is so successful at this. All right. Well, thank you both. Another
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:43.520]   member of our audience, Dawn asks, what do you see as the implications of the trending pushback or
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.960]   rejection of traditional employment arrangements? For example, should organizations prepare to have
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:54.400]   larger contingent labor populations, permanent external operation partners, and so on?
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:01.920]   What's your future? I think this cat's been out of the bag for a long time, but I don't think
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:08.240]   people realize that 40 to 50% of the American workforce is contingent now. So it's much bigger
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:12.800]   than you think. And even when you go into big companies, you go to pharmaceutical companies,
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:18.880]   tech companies, significant numbers of their workers are contractors or outsourced to other
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:26.320]   agencies. So yes, this is a huge trend. I think the reason that maybe HR people don't see it is
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.560]   we don't tend to manage that part of the workforce. We don't see it because that part of the workforce
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:36.640]   is oftentimes in a procurement system, but that's got to come in. So there's a trend for more and
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:43.040]   more functionality of the contingent workforce to be in the HR tech stack so that the company can
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:47.680]   manage the contingent workforce as carefully as they can manage the full-time hour, you know,
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:56.400]   paid workforce. And just to add to that, my team at Eightfold actually did a forecast of contingent
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:06.480]   workers. And we saw in, we did this in 2022 and we saw 2023, it's going to be an increase of 53%
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:17.280]   of contingent workers globally. 2024 would see a 34% increase. 2025 would see a 25% increase.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:21.280]   And then 2026 would be a decrease. - We're all going to be contractors.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:28.160]   - Yeah, so it's on the rise. And we think that because of economic uncertainty. So
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:34.480]   will employers be choosing these contingent workers over full-time employees? And then also
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:42.080]   how jobs and contracts and the future of work might look like. You might just want someone
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:49.440]   for a specific period of time to fulfill a role or fulfill a need, and you might not
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.360]   need them for longer. So that's what we're thinking. -
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:43:02.240]   Now, we talked briefly about the flatter organization. - SWV Audio Capture, not
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:06.640]   registered. - Audience member Triparna, I hope I'm pronouncing that name correctly, says,
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:12.720]   asks, "In a flatter organization where promotions or change in titles were much appreciated in the
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:17.920]   past, but no longer available now, how do we give people a tangible sense of career
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:22.320]   progression or advancement?" - Let me talk about that because I've been
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:28.160]   through this. So I had the experience of working for Deloitte for seven years. And in a sense,
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.560]   every company is becoming like a professional services company. And the way it works in a
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:39.040]   professional services company is you don't get a new title or a new level. You get promoted and
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:45.520]   your pay based on the contribution you've made, the reputation you have, the skills that you've
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:53.120]   delivered, the projects you've achieved, and of the people that ask for you to work with them
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:59.520]   on new things. That is the way we should be rewarding people. Not on, "Oh, I got myself
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:03.840]   to this level. So doggone it, I'm not moving. And you're not getting my slot because I'm hanging
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:10.400]   onto it with both hands until I retire." That is the old industrial model. It gets in the way of
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:16.320]   all of these changes we need to make. And it turns out in that kind of a sort of organizational
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:22.400]   model, it's very exciting for people because they get to work with other groups. They get to do
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:29.200]   different projects. Usually there's a career advisor or a manager or a coach that helps the
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:35.600]   person. And you can have a magnificent career in an organization like that. And you can still reach
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.520]   very, very high levels of contribution and span of control if that's what you want to do.
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:47.120]   So it's really a change in reward system and a change in sort of storytelling. In the old days,
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:51.680]   the storytelling was, "Oh, someday you'll have the corner office. Someday you'll have the special
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:58.320]   parking space. Someday you'll have the company car." We need to kind of let that go.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:02.880]   - Yeah. Here's a question, interesting question.
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:06.000]   - SWB Audio captured, not registered.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.480]   - The future labor market would seem to apply only for the subset which acquires
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   the skills and keeps up. Is the future then ever increasing inequality across wages?
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:23.680]   Will that get worse enough to risk social stability? But one thing leads to another perhaps,
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:29.280]   but is there going to be the skilled and the not as skilled and like increased divide?
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:41.840]   - I can take this one. So I think we might see like two different ways of looking at it. So we
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:51.280]   might see the skilled workers that will need to get up-skilled and if they don't get up-skilled,
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:46:00.080]   productivity will lag. And those people might not move into the future careers of the future
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:07.600]   and future needs of the employer as well. And then there's the other, I don't want to call them low
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:15.280]   skilled 'cause that's not what they are, but maybe those workers that might be skilled in plumbing or
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:20.800]   apprenticeship programs or things of that nature. And so those are going to be in high demand as
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:28.960]   well because an AI can't take over those jobs. So what we might see is like a converging of labor.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:35.440]   And those are the two areas where labor will be important and will be needed. And
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:44.880]   if we don't get those people on the one hand who are doing all of the plumbing and whatnot,
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:54.160]   like the mechanical skills, then they'll be in higher demand and have higher pay as well.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:47:03.120]   - Yeah, yeah. My perspective on this is, I think we've reached a very high level of inequality
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:12.080]   in the United States right now for a whole bunch of reasons. And I think this, I don't think it's
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:17.360]   only because of the skills shortage. I think there's other reasons. There's racial issues
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:23.440]   and so forth and discrimination and diversity and so forth that have caused that. My positive
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:32.400]   thinking on this is because of the more mobile sort of job models we're going to have inside
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:37.520]   companies, we're not going to force you to have a college degree with a computer science degree
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:44.080]   from Stanford to get a job in software. Now, if you don't want to educate yourself and you don't
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:48.800]   feel like you have the capability of being a software engineer, fine. You want to be a nurse,
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.720]   you want to work in a hospital. I mean, I think there's going to be more opportunities for people
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:48:00.880]   that don't necessarily have these pedigrees. And so honestly, I think the situation for
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:06.640]   underskilled people is going to get better. But given the fact that careers are longer and
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.920]   lifetimes are longer, people that don't want to reeducate themselves are taking a risk.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:18.160]   Even a plumber who doesn't know the latest technology in plumbing isn't going to be a
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:24.800]   very good plumber. So I think there, I think this, and the government spends a lot of time and money
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.160]   on this. And I think we're just going to have to continue to provide a lot of education
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:32.640]   opportunities for people so they can move to the direction where the labor market is going.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:38.640]   Well, we have, we have time. Thank you. Thanks, Josh. We have time for one more question.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:44.000]   And it kind of derives from what you just said, which is one of part of this conversation is
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.880]   determining whether people actually have the rapidly evolving skills required for work. So
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:54.320]   how best should enterprises tackle the accreditation of people's skills at scale
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:59.280]   and at pace? So we've done webinars on credentials and there's so many, you know,
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:07.040]   any quick take on that? Well, we do a lot of research on this. And, you know, I think there's
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:12.640]   two things companies have to do. Number one, they have to have SWB audio capture not registered
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:19.520]   down in their hearts that every human being can do more. And then if we give them the opportunity,
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:23.120]   they are capable of doing it because some companies don't have that. Some companies think
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:28.160]   if you're stuck over here, that's it. You're never going to make it over here. That's that mindset
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:35.920]   has to go. And then the company just has to invest in tools and programs and support for educations,
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:43.440]   training, skilling, skill systems like eightfold, because that investment pays off in the productivity
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:48.160]   and the growth of the people you have. And given that it's hard to hire somebody on the outside,
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:53.120]   by the way, I have some research that shows that it can be six times more expensive to hire a
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:58.240]   highly skilled person than to develop them internally. That money should be available
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:03.600]   because you're counterbalancing it against a very difficult job of hiring people. So to me,
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:10.400]   those are the two issues. So I think we have a half a minute left. Yeah. And I think just to add
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:17.200]   to that, we have something called a skills portfolio. And I think the like the number one
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:23.920]   thing that companies need to do when we ask them to when they work with us is really what is your
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:31.200]   department need and what is your organization need and break it down into what are those actual
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:36.720]   skills that you'll need for the future. And then let's like take a step back and look at it from
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:41.840]   big picture to small picture. And then what skills do you have in your workforce and then how do they
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:47.920]   align up? So I think it's not just, oh, these are the 10 skills of the future and let me just
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:55.120]   reskill people, but really being methodical about where those people are going to be working and
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:02.960]   what departments and for what need. All right. Well, I wish we had more time. Sonia, Josh,
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:08.400]   thanks so much for sharing all of these thoughts and research and great tips for our audience.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:12.720]   Thanks to Eightfold for your support and to all of you who participated today.
