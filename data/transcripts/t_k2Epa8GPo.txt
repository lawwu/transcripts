[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.220]   the first part of the fourteenth verse of the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.220]   Ephesians.
[00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.840]   The epistle to the Ephesians, chapter six, and the first part of verse fourteen.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.000]   Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.200]   Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.640]   We come here, in other words, to the beginning of our consideration of this whole armor of
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.540]   God, which the great apostle, you remember, has exhorted these Ephesian Christians and
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:54.060]   all others through them to put on, in the withstanding the vials of the devil and in
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.600]   wrestling against the principalities and powers and the rulers of the darkness of this world
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.760]   and spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.120]   It is essential, he says, that we should first be strong in the Lord and in the power of
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:17.160]   his might, and then that we take unto ourselves and put on the whole armor of God.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.240]   And we are now considering this second great injunction about putting on the whole armor
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.760]   of God.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.880]   We introduced this subject last Sunday morning when we pointed out certain general truths
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.920]   and principles which are clearly taught and inculcated here by the great apostle.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.900]   We ended with this emphasis, that he is very concerned, obviously, that we should put it
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.900]   all on.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.680]   He repeats that, put on the whole armor of God.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.680]   And again, therefore, take unto you the whole armor of God.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.400]   We need it all.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.160]   Every part of us has got to be protected and covered.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:06.080]   Nothing is more fatal than a kind of lopsided Christianity which lacks balance.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.680]   The whole armor of God.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:16.240]   But that in turn doesn't mean that we should not pay very great attention to particulars.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:24.320]   As our hymn puts it, put on the gospel armor, each piece put on with prayer.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.000]   There is no contrast between the whole and the parts in that fundamental sense.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.440]   It is necessary that we should emphasize both aspects.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.480]   I put it last Sunday morning in terms of strategy and tactics.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.280]   And to wage a successful war, it is vital that we should be clear and expert in both
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.280]   those departments.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.840]   Well, now, having in that way introduced the subject in general, let me remind you once
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.440]   more that what we've got here is just a picture.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:10.480]   It's a kind of material, external picture of something which is itself internal or interior
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.400]   and essentially spiritual.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.360]   The great danger always with a picture like this is to materialize it over much.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.720]   Many have fallen into this trap.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.120]   It may be the one defect in William Bernal's great book.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:37.720]   The Christian in full armor, a tendency perhaps to over-elaborate the details in terms of
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.720]   the picture.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.320]   It was perhaps the great temptation that always confronted the Puritans, the tendency to allegorize
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.760]   over much or, if you like, to turn a parable into an allegory.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.320]   We've always got to watch that.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.120]   And it's a principle that we must bear in mind as we proceed to the interpretation of
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.360]   the significance of these different parts in this whole armor of God.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.960]   It's a very valuable picture, as we saw.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.240]   The apostle was very familiar with it.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.720]   As a prisoner, he was amongst these soldiers and always having to look at them, changed
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.680]   sometimes to a soldier on the right hand and on the left.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.160]   It came very naturally to him.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.760]   And he says, "Now here is a kind of picture of what we've got to do in a spiritual sense."
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.680]   But let's bear in mind, I say, that that is the way in which he uses this picture, lest
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:39.700]   we become too material in our exposition and over-elaborate certain details.
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.640]   These pictures surely are to be handled always in a fairly general manner.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:52.560]   Well, now, you notice that there are six main pieces to this armor, all together.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.360]   He starts off by saying that we are to have our loins girt about with truth.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.600]   We are to put on the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.280]   Our feet are to be shoved with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:11.400]   Then we are to take up the shield of faith, to put on the helmet of salvation, and to
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.760]   use the sword of the Spirit.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.360]   There are six pieces mentioned.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.880]   Now, here again is a point I think that's of importance for us to remember.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.040]   The Apostle Shirley never meant this to be exhaustive.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.400]   There are other aspects.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.200]   What he does is to pick out the most important ones, the most vital ones, the ones that are
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.640]   absolutely essential as we look at the spiritual warfare in general.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.520]   Now, how can we divide up these six pieces?
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.000]   Is it possible to divide them?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.280]   Well, I think it is.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.920]   I tend to agree with most who would say that the six pieces can be divided into two groups
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.400]   of three.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:04.240]   And the basis of the division is roughly this, that the first three are actually parts that
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.520]   are fixed onto the body.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.720]   The girdle, for instance, about the loins, is something that is actually fixed in position
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.720]   on the body.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.520]   So, the breastplate, it isn't something that hangs loosely or has some loose attachment
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.800]   to the figure, to the body.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.120]   It's something that has to be, as it were, braced on.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.640]   And likewise, the sandals, of course, have to be fixed firmly upon the feet.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.440]   Well, there then is probably the best way of dividing it.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.760]   Whereas, when you come to the shield, of course, it actually is not fixed to the body at all.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.360]   You hold it with the helmet.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.400]   We mustn't think of the helmet in terms of what is perhaps more familiar to us, the kind
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.960]   of helmet that they wore in the Middle Ages.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.960]   The helmet that was worn at this time consisted really of a kind of leather cap with pieces
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.160]   of metals on it, which a man just put on his head.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.960]   It wasn't fixed, so that the attachment is not as firm as was the case with the first
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.960]   three.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.480]   And obviously, the sword is not something that is fixed and attached to the body.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.400]   I think that's quite a good way of dividing up these six pieces, and I think we shall
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:25.160]   see the significance of that division as we proceed with our interpretation of what the
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.200]   significance of the pieces really is.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.160]   Well, then, there it is in general.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:36.840]   There are these first three pieces that literally have to be fixed on the body, placed in position
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.560]   firmly so that they can't move.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.640]   That is the relationship.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.120]   The others bear a more loose and indirect relationship to the body.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.440]   Then the other, only other comment I have before I come to the first piece is this,
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:56.920]   that surely the order in which they are put is of very great importance and of significance.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:03.200]   The apostle didn't put them down at random in a haphazard manner, as they might occur
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.200]   to him or as he looked at a soldier.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.800]   No, he builds up a case here.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.800]   And what he says in the spiritual realm, of course, is equally true in the physical realm
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.080]   with the actual soldier.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.200]   The order is a very vital one.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:26.440]   And as he's instructing us how to fight this fight and wage this warfare, it is essential
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:33.480]   that we should adopt his order and look at these separate pieces of the armor in the
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.080]   way in which he introduces them to us.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:44.360]   Very well, then, as we fight the devil and try to withstand his wiles and his subtlety
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.000]   and all that we consider of great length.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.640]   Here, then, is the first thing we have to do, having your lines girt about with truth.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:03.240]   Now this authorized translation here is not as good as it might be, because it's misleading
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.320]   in one sense, that it puts it in a kind of passive way instead of active.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.240]   Instead of reading, therefore, "Stand therefore, having your lines girt about with truth,"
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.800]   as if somebody else did it for you, the better translation is, "Stand therefore, having
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.440]   girted your lines about with truth."
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.200]   In other words, it is you and I who have got to do this.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.000]   The girdle is not put on us; we have to put it on.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.200]   It is something that we have to take up, as I've been emphasizing, and we have to take
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:43.120]   up this girdle, and we have to put it firmly in position on our lines.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.280]   Now here is the picture.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.680]   Let's look at it.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.280]   What is the value of this girdle?
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:58.920]   It's a kind of belt or girdle which is fixed upon this part of the body, the lines.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.240]   Well the first thing we have to say about it is that it's not to be put on merely for
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.540]   the sake of decoration.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.720]   It's not an adornment.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:13.640]   Now, this is where you see we have to be careful with these analogies and illustrations.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:19.440]   Belts are often worn purely for adornment, for the sake of appearance, but that wasn't
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.520]   in the mind of the apostle.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.760]   This is something, according to him, which is absolutely essential to this fight, and
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:32.240]   it's the first thing we have to do, the first thing that we have to put on.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.240]   It's vital.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.240]   Why?
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.240]   Well, for this reason.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.320]   What is the function of the girdle?
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:43.000]   Here we have to remember that the apostle was writing in his own times, in his own day
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.760]   and generation, and it was the custom then for people, men included, to wear long and
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:55.560]   flowing garments, something like this gown that I have on, perhaps even longer.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.240]   They wore flowing garments.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:02.520]   You've often seen the pictures and illustrations of this.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:09.440]   And the purpose of the girdle was this, was to gather up and to bind together these flowing
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.440]   garments.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.240]   That was its function.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.120]   When a man was sitting down and relaxed, he took off his girdle.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.400]   But the moment he wanted to do something, the first thing he did was to gather his garments
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:28.200]   together and then fix them in position by this girdle, which he banded around his lines.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   Why?
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.800]   Well, the answer is quite obvious.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:37.400]   If he didn't do that, these flowing garments of his would have been a hindrance to him.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.040]   He'd have been stepping on them, he would have been fumbling as he was trying to handle
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:47.200]   the sword and as he held up his shield, and in all his movement, the loose garments would
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   have been a positive hindrance to him.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:56.520]   So the first thing that the soldier always did when he was preparing for action, when
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:01.400]   he was getting ready to meet an enemy, was to brace all his clothing together and fix
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:08.120]   them firmly in position by this tight band or belt, which had the function thus of holding
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.920]   all his clothing in position.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.440]   Now then, why did he do that?
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.240]   Well, I've been more or less answering it.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:21.680]   He did it, of course, in order that he might brace himself up and tone himself up.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:27.680]   From being relaxed, he now realized he's got to be actively on duty and he needs to brace
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.400]   all his energies, and so he does that, and the very putting on of the girdle and putting
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.680]   it firm in position, in and of itself braces one up and tightens one up and prepares one
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.880]   for action.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:48.920]   But still more important, as I say, is the fact that the doing of this sets him free.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:54.800]   He is now quite unencumbered in all his actions and in all his movements.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.680]   You see, if he didn't do this, he'd all along be having to make sure that he didn't trip
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.800]   over his long flowing garment and he'd have to be holding it up with one hand.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.480]   Well, in that case, he couldn't hold up his shield, as I say, and he couldn't handle the
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.600]   sword with the other.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:12.880]   But so he fixes all these, and therefore he knows that he's quite free.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:18.680]   He needn't be afraid that he'll trip or that he'll fall or that he'll get involved in the
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.440]   part of the garment and get mixed up with it.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.360]   Now, the thing I think explains itself more or less.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:31.760]   It is essential to free and unencumbered action, and therefore all this leads to the third
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.080]   point, which is that it gives such a person a sense of security.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:44.320]   You're ready, you're keyed up, you're wound up, as it were, you're alert and you're tense,
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.320]   you're turned up for your action, and you feel that everything's in order, everything
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.880]   is in position, and you're going to move as one piece, instead of parts of you militating
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.360]   against what you were proposing to do.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:01.680]   It immediately, therefore, gives one a sense of confidence and a sense of security.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:08.680]   Now you'll find that this picture is one which is used very frequently in the Scriptures.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.440]   Now the Lord himself used it.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:17.480]   You'll find him using it in the twelfth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke, where
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:24.920]   he is warning his disciples to be ever watchful and wary and careful.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.280]   Same point exactly as the apostle makes here, and he puts it in this way.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.640]   Let your lines be girded about and your lights burning.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.480]   That's it.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.520]   Let your lines be girded about, ready for action.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.800]   That's the first step always.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.980]   The first thing that you do to be ready, prepared, is to gird up your lines.
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:50.000]   Never be caught, he says, in a condition in which you're not ready for this action.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.120]   It's another way of putting the great exhortation, "Ye shall stand therefore, having your lines
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.080]   girded about with truth."
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:05.000]   Let your lines be girded about and your lights burning.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.880]   In other words, it is the first principle which is that we are ready for action, prepared
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:16.360]   for any eventuality that may come.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:23.600]   And I therefore thus demonstrate, I believe, that the order in which the apostle puts these
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.800]   things before us was something that he did very deliberately.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.680]   This is the foundation of everything else.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:39.280]   It would be idle and useless to proceed to the other parts of the armour unless we're
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.640]   all perfectly clear about this.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:46.880]   Now, there are those who say that the girdle should be interpreted in a still more fundamental
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.840]   sense, that it is the sort of foundation of all the garments, and you start with your
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.760]   foundation and then put other things on on top of it.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.640]   I'm prepared to accept that.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:04.280]   But what is clear in both cases is this, is that it is foundational, that we cannot hope
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:09.600]   to do anything, there'd be nothing but confusion if we didn't start with this and make absolutely
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.700]   sure of it, the girdle.
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:18.160]   But now we come to the way in which he uses this picture of the girdle in his spiritual
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.160]   manner.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:26.840]   "Having girded about your lines," he says, "with truth."
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.200]   Now here is the question, what does this mean?
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.480]   I say it's foundational, very well, it's foundational therefore to know exactly what he means by
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.000]   truth here.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.600]   And there has been a great deal of discussion about this.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:47.840]   Indeed, it's rarely interesting, not to say almost amusing at times, to watch the way
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.960]   in which the expositors deal with this.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.120]   And I feel the trouble is that they tend to become too rigid about it.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.960]   This applies less even to Charles Hodge.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.320]   In working out the analogy, they tend to say like this.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.600]   They say, "Now what is it, what is meant here by truth?"
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.560]   And they say, "Your first instinct, of course, is to say that it's the word of God, the truth
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.560]   of the scriptures."
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.040]   "Ah, but," they say, "it can't be that.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:21.960]   It can't be that for this reason, that later on," he says here, "take the helmet of salvation
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.880]   and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.680]   So, you see, it can't possibly be the objective truth here.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.400]   The objective truth is coming under the figure and the analogy of the sword.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.540]   It can't be that here.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.800]   So they put it right out immediately.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:44.440]   Now that's what I mean when I say that there is the danger of being mechanical in our interpretation.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:53.120]   And so they go on to say that as it cannot be this objective truth, it must be something
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.400]   more subjective in us.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.300]   Now, here some of them go so far as to say that this therefore means nothing but a kind
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.280]   of sincerity in us.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.920]   It means truthfulness, not so much truth as truthfulness in us.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:16.880]   As David says in the 51st Psalm, "Thou desirest truth in the inward parts, sincerity, candour,
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.080]   truthfulness, openness, if you like."
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.480]   Now they say this is absolutely the basis of everything.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.760]   We've got to be honest.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.440]   So he starts with that.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:31.600]   You put on the girdle of truthfulness, of sincerity, of candour, and of openness, because
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.880]   without this you are absolutely helpless and hopeless.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:42.440]   Now they arrive at that, I say, by that process of excluding objective truth, because they
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:47.880]   think that that's included in the picture concerning the sword of the Spirit, which
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.840]   is the Word of God.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:56.440]   But this seems to me to be a very grievous and almost dangerous misinterpretation.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.440]   Why do I say so?
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.720]   How do I answer this objection?
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:06.760]   Well, I answer it by saying that it's not a valid objection for this good reason, that
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:11.560]   there are two ways in which you can look upon truth.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:17.640]   There is a purely objective way, and there is a purely subjective way, but you mustn't
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.880]   confine it to that.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.400]   We have to accept the statement, of course, that the sword of the Spirit is the Word of
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:33.160]   God, but I am equally anxious to say that the girdle is also the Word of God, but looked
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.360]   at in a different manner.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   What's the difference?
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:43.440]   Well, I want to put it to you that it's this, and I shall develop it as we go along.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:52.920]   There is all the difference between truth as a whole and truth in its separate portions.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.320]   Let me illustrate what I mean.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.320]   The sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:04.440]   Now there is a perfect and supreme illustration of what is meant by that, of course, in what
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:11.200]   we see in the temptation of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in the wilderness by the devil.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:15.640]   You remember the devil came tempting, and our Lord answered him by saying, "It is written."
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.800]   There he's using the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:26.480]   Yes, but what he's doing, of course, is to quote particular scriptures.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:32.280]   And to me that's a very different thing from talking about the whole truth of the Bible,
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.040]   the whole truth concerning the doctrine of salvation.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:45.600]   And therefore I suggest that what we've got here is the whole truth, the truth in and
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.880]   of itself, speaking of truth in an objective manner, but which comes to us, of course,
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.880]   subjectively also.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.800]   There is the first part of my answer.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.360]   And the second part is this, that this cannot possibly be truthfulness and sincerity and
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:10.240]   candor for this good and sufficient reason, that if we are going to rely upon our sincerity
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:17.320]   and truthfulness as the fundamental piece of the armor in the fight with the devil,
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:22.640]   well then I say we are all already defeated, and the campaign is lost.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:30.760]   Rather, our position is as it's expressed in the lines of a hymn, "I dare not trust
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.960]   my sweetest frame."
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.680]   Are you prepared to trust yourself?
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:41.560]   No, we are all in the position of saying, "I am what I am by the grace of God."
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.080]   The foundation garment of my armor is not my own sincerity and truthfulness.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.740]   If it were, I'm undone.
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.120]   We all are.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.120]   It can't be that.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.120]   It's a sheer impossibility.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:57.680]   The apostle here is telling us that it's an armor provided for us by God, not something
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.720]   belonging to us primarily, but something that we are able to put on, something that is given
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.720]   to us.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.920]   Very well, what is this?
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.440]   How do we interpret truth as it's used here by the apostle?
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:18.520]   Let's adopt the method of approach which I think we must always adopt whenever we find
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.320]   ourselves face to face with a difficulty like this.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:25.120]   There is a difficulty on the surface, let's grant that.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.280]   The sword of the Spirit which is the word of God, that seems to fix it, but it doesn't.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.880]   Very well, let's see how we can arrive at the meaning of this truth by searching the
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.280]   Scriptures, comparing Scripture with Scripture.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:41.080]   That's the royal method of exposition always.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.760]   Now we've already considered one this morning in reading that section out of the eighth
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:50.400]   chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:56.960]   There we are told, you remember, in verses 30 and following, that as he spake these words,
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.520]   many believed on him.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:08.760]   "Then said Jesus unto those Jews which believed on him, if ye continue in my word, then are
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:16.520]   ye my disciples indeed, and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:24.000]   Now, you've noticed the terms, and they're all very important.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.640]   He talks about knowing the truth.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.720]   In other words, he's speaking about it as a whole.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:33.320]   He's not saying you shall know the truths, which is the particulars, which come in under
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.320]   the sword of the Spirit.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.200]   No, no, the truth, the thing as a whole, the whole teaching.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:43.360]   Ye shall know the truth, the truth of God, the full summation of truth, and that truth
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.520]   shall make you free.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.520]   Free from what?
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:51.840]   Well, the context is from the devil, from your father the devil and so on.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:56.000]   Well, now there it is, and notice particularly the emphasis.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.320]   He says, "If ye continue in my word."
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.080]   That's the thing, that's essential.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:07.080]   He says, "You seem to have believed, very well, then if you continue in my word, if
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:13.280]   you continue in my instruction, if you continue in the instruction concerning the truth, then
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.600]   you'll be disciples indeed, and then the truth which will thus be imparted to you and
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.880]   which you will be continuing in will make you free."
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:28.480]   Here it is, in order to be free from the devil and his wiles, put on the girdle of truth,
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.120]   this truth, this great teaching, my word.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.200]   There's one illustration.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.920]   But come to another.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.240]   Take our Lord's phrase in the high priestly prayer in the seventeenth chapter of the Gospel
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.520]   of John and in the seventeenth verse.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:49.080]   "Sanctify them," he says, "by thy truth."
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.640]   Thy word is truth.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.720]   Sanctify them.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.000]   Sanctification is by the truth.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And what is the truth?
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.240]   Well, it is thy word, this word of God.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.800]   And what we are dealing with here in Ephesians, of course, is nothing but sanctification,
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.600]   it's a part of it.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.320]   And therefore I say that the meaning is exactly the same here as it is in John 8 and as it
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:15.200]   is in John 17.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.040]   But take another example.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:22.320]   The apostle in addressing the Corinthians in the first epistle and in the sixteenth
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:33.680]   chapter and the thirteenth verse says this, "Be strong, stand fast in the faith."
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.880]   There it is, the faith, the truth and the faith are alternative terms.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.880]   Stand fast in the faith.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.680]   There it is, you see, in Ephesians.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:47.800]   Stand there for having your lines dirt about with truth, the faith.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:54.120]   It's looking at it as a whole, the whole message, the whole attitude and the whole position.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.280]   Or again, let's go on and listen to the apostle Peter saying the same thing.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.160]   He is writing his first epistle to people who are in trouble and in difficulties and
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.320]   having a great battle against the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.320]   What does he say to them?
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:14.040]   Having outlined the whole position, he takes up the real argument in the thirteenth verse
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:23.240]   of the first chapter and he says, "Wherefore, gird up the loins of your mind."
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.440]   Well what does the mind deal with?
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.240]   The mind deals with truth.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.960]   The mind deals with the faith.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.680]   The mind deals with the word of God.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.160]   "Gird up," he says, "the loins of your mind."
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.600]   I really believe that's what the apostle is saying here.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   But you notice, "the loins of your mind."
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.600]   Well that's it.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.520]   That's the way to interpret what the apostle Paul says.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.040]   He's talking about the mind.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.560]   Don't think too much of the body.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.560]   Don't materialize the illustration.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.440]   He's thinking spiritually.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.720]   But it's the loins of the mind.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.140]   Because the greatest thing in man is his mind.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.920]   And his mind must come first in its enlightenment if he's to fight successfully.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.800]   "Gird up the loins of your mind."
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.120]   And then you've got Peter saying it again in the fifth chapter of that first epistle
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.080]   and in the ninth verse.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.240]   He's actually talking about the devil.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:17.320]   "Your adversary the devil," he says, "is a roaring lion.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.240]   Roameth about seeking whom he may devour."
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.240]   What about it?
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.360]   Well he says, "Whom resist."
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.360]   How?
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.920]   "Steadfast in the faith."
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.000]   Steadfast in the faith.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.400]   In other words, the first thing he says there is, "You resist by being steadfast in the
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.400]   faith."
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.400]   How do you be steadfast in the faith?
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.800]   You girdle it upon you.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:44.040]   You girdle yourself, bind up yourself and your clothing with truth.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.840]   Well now I think that those examples help to throw great light upon what we are dealing
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.200]   with so I interpret truth like this.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:28:00.160]   It means a belief of and a knowledge of the truth as it is in Christ Jesus.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:07.400]   The objective truth, yes, but which I possess in a subjective manner.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.200]   Let me put it like this then.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:17.240]   It means a mastery of the truth, but it means also being mastered by the truth.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.920]   That's what it means.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.120]   That I'm held by the truth.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.120]   This is the thing that binds me and holds me together and puts me on my feet and gives
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:29.920]   me vigor and strength and power, the truth.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.960]   Or to put it more particularly, it means this.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:39.480]   It means that I have such a knowledge of the truth and such an appropriation and understanding
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:48.720]   of it that it controls the whole of my life, that it controls the whole of my thinking,
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:55.760]   the whole of my outlook, the whole of my actions, all my reactions, everything that I think
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.760]   and say and do.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.800]   Nothing less than that.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:08.520]   To have the loins goat about with truth means this therefore, that my whole life is governed
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.520]   by the truth.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.720]   Now you notice therefore that it brings in the two elements.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.440]   When I talk about being governed by the truth it means the truth as it is revealed in Christ
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.440]   Jesus.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.440]   That's objective.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.640]   It's the truth that I've got here in the Bible, the truth.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.800]   Yes, but you see, it isn't merely that I look on at this intellectually and study it
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.840]   as if it were the works of Shakespeare.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.840]   Not at all.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:38.640]   It's that this truth now gets hold of me and makes me one and governs my whole attitude
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.520]   of the world, the flesh, the devil and everything else that happens.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.960]   I've girded myself around with it.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.040]   Gird up the loins of your mind.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:59.280]   Be steadfast and hope to the end for the glory which, the grace which shall be revealed unto
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.800]   you says Peter.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:07.800]   Well now then, here then I think is the thing with which we of necessity must start.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.300]   Here is the first thing we put on.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.720]   And without it we are completely lost.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.720]   What does it mean?
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.160]   Well it means this, doesn't it?
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:24.020]   It means that we've got a settled conviction with regard to the truth.
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:29.300]   It means that there is no uncertainty, no doubt.
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:35.220]   It even means that there must be no lack of clarity.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:40.260]   You see there is no hope, he says, unless you put this on first.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:47.800]   And it means nothing less than that, that we should know whom we have believed and we
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.360]   should know what we believe.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:59.160]   The girdle is truth, looked on, understood, received, appropriated and in such a manner
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.240]   that it is governing the whole of my attitude in every respect.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.560]   It's the only way, says the apostle, in which you can possibly fight this successful warfare
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.080]   against this enemy.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:18.520]   Now this follows surely of necessity from what we've already been considering.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:24.720]   In dealing with the wiles of the devil, we saw, and we had to spend a great deal of time
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:30.920]   with it, that this, of all the things that he tries to do to us, is the one that he does
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.420]   most frequently.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.000]   He tries to confuse us.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.480]   He tries to send us astray with regard to what we believe.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.000]   That is the work of the devil.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.600]   He's a liar, he's a murderer, he's the accuser of the brethren, he's the adversary, and as
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:54.960]   we saw, he exercises these various powers above everything in that respect, that he
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.320]   tries to create confusion, uncertainty.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.920]   And the moment he does that, we are already defeated.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.200]   Very well, how do you repel him?
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.600]   Gird yourselves about with truth.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:11.840]   And if you don't, you're already defeated almost before you have started.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:16.280]   Now there is much evidence with regard to this.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:23.120]   Don't you see the need of putting on the girdle of truth even in the New Testament itself?
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:29.260]   At the very beginning of the early church, the devil tried to sow the seeds of confusion
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.480]   and of uncertainty.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:34.520]   He did it first, of course, with regard to the whole question of the admission of the
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.720]   Gentiles into the Christian church.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:42.800]   He tried to make the Jewish Christians hold on to circumcision as being absolutely essential,
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.360]   and the observance of the law.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.280]   Now you can read about that in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.740]   You can read about it likewise in the Epistle to the Galatians.
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.880]   And it's essential that we should know these things.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.520]   The devil, you see, at the very beginning, he came in and tried to sow this seed of doubt.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.520]   "Oh," he said, "it's all right to believe in Christ, but if you're not circumcised, you're
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.520]   not a Christian.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.800]   Everyone has to become a Jew before he can be a real Christian."
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:08.680]   And so confusion tended to come in, and the apostles had to deal with this.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:13.920]   Oh, there's a great statement by the apostle Paul in the twentieth chapter of the book
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:21.480]   of the Acts of the Apostles where he's bidding farewell to the elders of the church at Ephesus
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:25.080]   when he warns them of what's going to happen after his departure.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:30.000]   "Take heed therefore," he says, "unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.880]   hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God which he hath purchased with his own
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.880]   blood.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:42.200]   For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   the flock.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:49.880]   Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.880]   them.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:56.560]   But watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn every one
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.800]   night and day with tears."
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   And that's how he spent his time, teaching and preaching, enlightening them, giving them
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.680]   understanding because he knew that this was going to happen.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.720]   And it's the only—the hurdle of truth is absolutely essential.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.160]   You're defeated if you haven't got this knowledge.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.160]   There it is.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:19.280]   And again, as I say, you come to a little later period in the history of that early
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:25.520]   church and you find the same thing again.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.680]   How easy it is at a funeral service to listen to the reading of that magnificent fifteenth
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:33.480]   chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.360]   And the language is so wonderful and the balance of the sentences and the cadence and the glory
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.360]   and the beauty of the words fascinates us all and we say, "Marvellous, yes," but we sometimes
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.800]   forget as to what it's saying.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.880]   Why did he ever write that?
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:52.120]   He wrote it because there were people who were teaching that there was to be no final
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.880]   resurrection of the body.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.400]   It's a purely polemical piece of writing.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.380]   He was writing it to counter the attack of the devil upon the doctrine of the resurrection.
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.080]   It was essential that he should do it.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:11.040]   He says, "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable."
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.560]   So he has to write it to counter.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.420]   He does exactly the same thing.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:19.400]   In the second epistle to Timothy, chapter 2, he says, "There are these people who are
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:24.400]   saying that the resurrection is past already and are undermining and shaking the faith
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.400]   of some."
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.520]   How does he answer?
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.120]   "The foundation of God standeth sure."
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.120]   What's that?
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.160]   "The foundation of God standeth truth."
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:38.200]   "My gospel," he says, "it's the only way in which you can answer this."
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.320]   Now, there we have it already, you see, in the New Testament.
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.040]   In fact, these New Testament epistles would probably never have been written were it not
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.040]   for this.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.600]   What are the New Testament epistles?
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.200]   Well, they're the very girdle that you and I are to put on, the girdle of truth.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.000]   We've got to be equipped with this if we really are going to meet this enemy.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.440]   We've got to have all this in our minds so that all our thinking is governed by it, so
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.000]   that when an attack comes, I've got my answer.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.840]   I'm ready, girded about with truth.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:13.200]   But you know, this problem didn't end with the early church.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:20.120]   It continued in the early centuries of the Christian church and her story.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:25.560]   You read that story and you'll find that certain great councils were held.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:30.360]   Christian leaders came together from different countries in great councils.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.360]   What for?
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.440]   Well, they came together in order to define the truth.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.440]   Why?
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.880]   Heretics had arisen.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.600]   False teachings were being propagated.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.680]   And the whole church was in a state of confusion.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.440]   Nobody knew exactly what to believe.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.920]   One said this, one said that, diametrically opposed, yet they all called themselves Christians.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:55.320]   And the early Christians, led by the Holy Spirit, met together in solemn council.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.720]   And what did they do in council?
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.640]   Well, they defined the truth.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.920]   They said, "This is right, that's wrong."
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:06.120]   They defined heresy and they condemned it and excommunicated men who taught it.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.640]   That's how the early church behaved.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:11.400]   If she hadn't, we wouldn't be meeting here this morning.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.720]   Greek philosophy came in and men were trying to understand what can't be understood and
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.880]   trying to explain.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.080]   And so the heresies arose and they had to meet in councils.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.360]   And what was the result?
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:26.800]   Well, what the result was, of course, that we have the so-called great creeds of the
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.960]   church.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.560]   The Apostles' Creed.
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.160]   You see, the Apostles' Creed would never have been written were it not for this very
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.080]   thing we are talking about.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.680]   The devil in his wildness had tried to cause this confusion in the church.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:41.680]   They met together.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:45.360]   They said, "These are the essentials of the faith, the Apostles' Creed.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.360]   Recite it.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.360]   Get it into your mind.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.360]   Put it on.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.360]   Gird yourself with it."
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:57.820]   The Nicene Creed, the Athanasian Creed, all these creeds came into being in exactly the
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:58.820]   same way.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:02.820]   It is a method of girding the lines with truth.
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:06.980]   The church accepted the teaching and put it into practice.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:12.340]   But this is not confined, of course, even to the early church.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:18.700]   You get the same thing always whenever there is a period of reformation and of revival.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:26.140]   I suppose in many ways the greatest characteristic of all of the Protestant Reformation was the
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:31.980]   way in which the early Protestant church proceeded to draw up its confessions.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:38.700]   The Augsburg Confession, the Belgic Confession, various confessions and catechisms, Heidelberg
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.700]   Catechism.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.700]   What is the value of these?
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.820]   Well, these things are just definitions of the truth.
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.580]   In order that the people might know what was right and what was wrong, in this country
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.700]   the Church of England drew up thirty-nine articles.
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:55.740]   Next century, the Westminster Conference Assembly drew up its Confession of Faith.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:00.380]   The church in every period of revival and awakening, when she is really alive and realizes
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.900]   the fight, has always done this very thing.
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:11.420]   And the drawing up of a confession is nothing but a way of girding up the lines of your
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:16.180]   mind or putting on the girdle of the truth.
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:18.220]   Why is it essential, I say?
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:21.340]   Well, it is essential for this reason.
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:27.300]   The apostle himself gives us the explanation in 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:31.620]   Evil communications corrupt good manners.
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.620]   Truth does matter.
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:37.180]   If you begin to go wrong in your communications, in what you say to one another and in your
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:41.020]   thoughts, it will lead to bad practice, bad manners, bad behavior.
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.620]   You will make shipwreck of the faith.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:51.420]   Error in doctrine is always fatal in the life of the individual and in the life of the church.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:56.460]   Or, as he has already put it in this very epistle to the Ephesians, in the fourth chapter,
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.300]   he puts it like this.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:03.580]   He says God has given to the church some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.580]   and teachers.
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.580]   What for?
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:09.540]   For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:14.340]   the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:18.860]   the Son of God into a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:19.860]   Christ.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:20.860]   There it is positively.
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:21.860]   But here's the negative.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:30.100]   That we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:38.100]   of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive.
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:39.660]   You see, that's the characteristic of children.
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:40.900]   They believe the last story.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.900]   Applausible men come selling books at the door.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.060]   They say, "It sounds very good.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.340]   He talks about the Bible.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.340]   It must be right.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.340]   This is Christ."
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:51.100]   So you buy the books and you join the society.
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.340]   Tossed about by every wind of doctrine.
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.340]   Why?
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.900]   Well, because you don't know your own doctrine.
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.700]   Because you haven't girded your lungs about with truth.
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:00.980]   Because you don't know where you are.
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:06.740]   You're like a child tossed to and fro, carried about by every wind of doctrine.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:11.740]   Well, we'll have to leave it at that for this morning.
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:19.700]   But there you see is this first great particular exhortation.
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:27.100]   There is nothing that we can do in this fight with the devil and his wilds unless we possess
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:31.940]   and are possessed by the truth.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:39.220]   Without a knowledge of what we believe and whom we believe, we are already undone.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:43.860]   We are already defeated.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:53.340]   Stand therefore, having girded your lungs about with truth.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:57.100]   Gird up the lungs of your mind.
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:09.780]   It's the first step in withstanding the devil and having done all things to stand.
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:14.780]   Amen.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.460]   The closing hymn is hymn number 232.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:24.660]   232, Lord, thy word abideth and our footsteps guideth.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:39.980]   Who its truth believeth, light and joy receiveth.
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:57.020]   O thy word abideth and our steps guideth.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:19.060]   Who its truth believeth, light and joy receiveth.
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:33.940]   And now unto him who is able to keep us from falling and to present us faultless before
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:41.340]   the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Savior, be glory
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:48.860]   and majesty, dominion and power both now and ever, and may the grace of the Lord Jesus
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:55.300]   Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:44:02.380]   and continue with us now throughout the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:10.620]   and pilgrimage, and until we shall be with the Church triumphant in glory.
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:16.700]   Amen.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.620]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
