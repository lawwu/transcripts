[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.440]   - All right, Jesse, I think we have time for one more call
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.320]   because I'm running late today,
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.840]   but let's get one more call in.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.760]   Who do we have here?
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.600]   - All right, sounds good.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.480]   We got a question, a call about living a deep life.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.320]   - There we go.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.980]   - Hi Cal, this is Karan.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.060]   And I took a break from my 33 jobs
[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.760]   to retreat to a cabin in the woods
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.240]   and think about who am I?
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.520]   What is identity and how is it crafted?
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.840]   And I came up with this heuristic
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.940]   that I would love your thoughts on.
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.600]   And I have a question that I put a lot of thought
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.520]   and research into.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.600]   First part of this heuristic that I came up with
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.680]   is identity.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.920]   Who am I and how do I live a deep life?
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.360]   And I go very descriptive into that area.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.720]   Next is philosophy.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.120]   Digital minimalism helps back up that identity.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.680]   Then we have framework.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.000]   We use digital minimalism as that framework
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.400]   for living a deep life,
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.440]   but we also have the atomic habits
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.560]   by James Clear.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.960]   And I use that as part of the framework category.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.760]   After that we have behavioral techniques
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.600]   and this is like where like the nitty gritty.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.800]   I leave my phone at home and I go for a walk.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.680]   I enjoy solitude.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.300]   And then we have outcomes,
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.420]   which is really important because we got to know
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.720]   how do these behaviors, what outcomes do they have?
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.680]   I back on how my anxiety goes down.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.380]   Now I'm reading Brad Stolberg's book
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.040]   on this idea of how I wanted to keep improving
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.080]   and this idea of always trying to optimize everything.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.920]   And this is where my question comes in.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.480]   'Cause the last part of my heuristic is feedback.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.960]   I wanna make sure I do better at living the deep life.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.520]   But this compound 1% interest that you and James talk about
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.360]   and that this idea that Brad talks about,
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.440]   it can be like, how do I,
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.180]   if I keep trying to optimize living a deep life,
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.160]   how do I get rid of this background of anxiety?
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.800]   - Well, Karan, I appreciate the thought you put into this.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.920]   And let me just preface my response by saying
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.420]   just the fact that you were putting
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.760]   this much intentional thought
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.960]   into how you want to structure your life
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.200]   is 80% of the battle.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.280]   Most people don't do that.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.600]   Most people go from one distraction
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.920]   or moment of chemical pleasure to another
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.920]   and hope to string along enough of those
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.440]   to get later on in life.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.880]   It's not the way to do it.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.800]   You need a plan, you need to be intentional.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.080]   The second thing I'm gonna preface it is
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.760]   these type of plans evolve over time and that's great.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.760]   The goal is not to figure out the one true plan
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.000]   that's absolutely optimal
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.440]   and then you have it all figured out, then you execute it.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.320]   You don't want paralysis by analysis here.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.240]   You come up with something, you live with it,
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.560]   check in twice a year,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.240]   checking at your birthday to make changes.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.080]   So you wanna make sure
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.400]   that you're spending a lot of time living life
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.680]   and not just thinking about how you're gonna live life.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.800]   So those are some prefaces.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.640]   All right, now let me start with your last point
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.320]   about beating back the background anxiety
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.380]   so that you can live a deep life.
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.000]   These are unrelated.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.960]   Anxiety will do what anxiety does.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.240]   You will feel anxiety sometimes, other times you won't.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.400]   There will be periods where it's heavier,
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.640]   there'll be periods where it is not heavier.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.760]   Your goal is not to make that go away.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.120]   Your goal is to live a deep life
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.560]   even though you live in a world
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.720]   in which you sometimes feel
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.400]   the physical symptoms of anxiety.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.120]   Constriction of the chest,
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.480]   a little bit difficulty of breathing.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.920]   There's very specific physical symptoms.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.200]   That comes and goes.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.180]   Great, what's next?
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.240]   How do I still build a deep life?
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.240]   I don't want you to think about banishing
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.400]   that which you cannot fully control from your life
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.760]   as a precondition for it being good,
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.960]   for it being enjoyable.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.940]   I'm gonna recommend the book here.
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.000]   So there are, I don't know how much you know
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.880]   about modern psychotherapy,
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.840]   but there's, roughly speaking,
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.780]   people think about there being three waves
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.920]   of modern psychotherapy.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.320]   You have the first wave where you have talk therapy,
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.400]   which sort of came originally out of Freudian modalities.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.640]   Let's talk things through
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.560]   and try to understand the source of issues.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.240]   Largely, this was non-evidence-based therapy modalities.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.000]   Then the second wave really is
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.960]   like cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.480]   And this was one of the first major approaches
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.880]   to issues like anxiety
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.400]   in which they were using studies and evidence
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.720]   and saying this type of thing worked.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.160]   In the core book, the canonical public-facing book
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.620]   in second wave psychotherapy is feeling good.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.260]   And I believe this came out,
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.460]   so the '70s or '80s,
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.460]   and it introduced cognitive behavioral therapy
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.920]   to a larger group.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.820]   Third wave psychotherapies is built more around
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.980]   what is sometimes called acceptance commitment therapy
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.260]   or ACT, A-C-T.
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.480]   There's some other things in there,
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.420]   but it pulls more from some Eastern philosophies as well.
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.140]   This is where I wanna turn your attention,
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.340]   and I wanna turn your attention to a book
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.260]   that popularizes ACT,
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.620]   and that is the book, I believe it is called
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.300]   The Happiness Trap.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.580]   Actually, Jesse, can you look that up
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.940]   and tell me what the author's name is?
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.340]   I wanna make sure I got that name right.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.840]   But it's a book that introduces acceptance commitment therapy
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.420]   to a broader audience.
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.780]   And this is a evidence-based methodology.
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.660]   It's something that's studied pretty well,
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.380]   and I like it a lot.
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.180]   I think it's what I wanna preach to you right now.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.020]   Because at the core,
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.580]   I can tell you what's at the core of acceptance,
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.780]   if you'll excuse this digression into psychotherapy,
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.340]   but at the core of this is this notion that,
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.280]   oh, we have a name here?
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.540]   Yeah, Russ Harris, that's right.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.460]   And it is The Happiness Trap, Jesse, did I get that right?
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.140]   - Yep. - That's right.
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.620]   So at the core of acceptance commitment therapy
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.740]   is they look back at cognitive behavioral therapy,
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.940]   and cognitive behavioral therapy
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.740]   directly addresses ruminations.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.220]   Ruminations, these insistent, hard-to-control conversations
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.340]   you have with yourself in your head
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.620]   are at the core of both major anxiety
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.960]   and depressive disorders.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.300]   Because if you're obsessively worried about,
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.300]   so you have these talks, these conversations in your head
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.940]   about bad things that could happen, it's anxiety.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.700]   And if you have these hard-to-control, consistent voices,
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.320]   conversations in your head about what you've done that's bad
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.140]   and why you suck, that's the foundation for depression.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.380]   So it's the same thing as the voices.
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.820]   And cognitive behavioral therapy,
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.620]   again, if you'll excuse the lecture here,
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.980]   focused on directly confronting ruminations.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.860]   And so you would say, wait a second,
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.820]   this is the thing I keep talking about.
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.940]   Let me actually point out the ways
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.780]   in which that thinking is distorted,
[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.980]   because often in anxiety and in depression
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.100]   is very distorted thinking.
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.580]   There's names for the distortion.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.560]   This is black and white thinking.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.620]   This is predicting the future.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.900]   And you call it out and you push back at it and say,
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.340]   this is the problem with this rumination.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.180]   And over time, that can actually diminish the power
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.540]   of that rumination to keep cycling faster and faster.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.780]   And this can be quite effective for a lot of things.
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.380]   In fact, I used this quite successfully,
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.460]   if you want a personal story,
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.460]   when I was first having bad insomnia problems
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.180]   early in grad school.
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.900]   And there's a whole backstory to that,
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.260]   but basically there's very little
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.700]   I get anxious about in my life,
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.220]   even as I do pretty ambitious, big things
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.460]   that should be scary.
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.100]   And my theory has always been,
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.540]   all these things I'm doing that should be really anxious,
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.700]   anxiety producing, all that anxiety just got funneled
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.940]   into this random weird thing,
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.700]   which was I got very anxious about sleep
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.940]   and I felt physical anxiety every single day.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.860]   I was sleeping, but the anxiety about not sleeping
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:23.700]   was every single day.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.860]   And I read "Feeling Good."
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.700]   I read the book about cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.620]   And this was a case where that worked really well,
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.740]   because the ruminations that were creating this anxiety
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.480]   about not sleeping were disordered.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.540]   They were clearly exaggerating.
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.540]   And I could call out the distortions.
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.740]   And I had a system where I said twice a day,
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.620]   in the morning and in the evening,
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.620]   I'm gonna address these thoughts
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.380]   and point out the distortions, but not in between.
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.940]   And in between, my mind's like,
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.660]   let's think about sleep and why we're worried.
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.860]   I would say, I thought about this,
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.740]   went through it in the morning and wasn't that impressed,
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.080]   and I'll do it again in the evening.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.740]   So just wait till then,
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.700]   and then we'll get back to it in the evening.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.320]   And that actually worked.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.260]   And the day-to-day anxiety,
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.100]   and for this particular anxiety, it took a long time,
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.220]   but it went away, it was very effective.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.660]   ACT came along and said,
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.100]   there's certain things for which that doesn't work.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.940]   Because what if the thing that you're anxious about,
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.940]   what if the story there is accurate?
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.220]   What if it's not distorted?
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.740]   And the key thing that really,
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.780]   the key thing that led to the divergence of ACT,
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.540]   my understanding of ACT from cognitive behavioral therapy,
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.640]   were panic attacks.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.580]   So even with panic attacks,
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.860]   you get a rising sense of panic,
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.060]   leads to a place where you kind of tip over an edge
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.300]   and have your heart goes, it feels like a heart attack,
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.120]   you can become faint,
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.020]   and it could be like a really just disturbing public thing.
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.620]   And what the ACT people pointed out was,
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.620]   that's not a, if you're anxious about that happening,
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.460]   you're gonna go on stage,
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.280]   you're anxious about that happening,
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.580]   it's not a distorted thought.
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.780]   Like it really could happen.
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.700]   And maybe this has been happening to you quite a bit.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.300]   So you can't look at yourself and convince yourself,
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.640]   oh, it's just distorted,
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.020]   of course you're not gonna have a panic attack.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.140]   I just had three, I very well could.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.460]   So cognitive behavioral therapy didn't work as well
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.620]   for panic attacks.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.540]   And so acceptance commitment therapy was about,
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.180]   okay, you're not trying to challenge the thought,
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.800]   you make space for the thought,
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.000]   but instead of getting into it,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.140]   like let's really get into it,
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.140]   you say, despite that,
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.620]   I'm gonna go commit to doing something
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.140]   that's value-driven.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.660]   Because what matters is living true to your values.
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.800]   Like that's ultimately what matters,
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.840]   I'm gonna commit to do that,
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.980]   even though something bad could happen.
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.580]   And ACT is all about,
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.380]   and you'll read this in "The Happiness Trap",
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.080]   you're able to separate from the feeling of anxiety.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.060]   It's there, it's the Eastern part of it.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.260]   But it's just a sensation, it's just physical.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.100]   Great, I'm feeling that, it's like my knee hurts.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.460]   Great, what's next?
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.380]   And you learn to separate from the part of your mind
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.260]   that wants to tell the stories.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.300]   We gotta think about this,
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.620]   but what if there's a panic attack?
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.500]   And what if this happens?
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.260]   And what if this or that happens?
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260]   And you say, I see that story there,
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.860]   and I'm not mad at that part of my mind,
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.620]   and it's like a character and I give it a name,
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.900]   and maybe this is the patron of panic attacks.
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.700]   And I'm not mad at that person, that character in my mind,
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.740]   but I'm not gonna get into it with them.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.140]   What I'm gonna do is this thing right here,
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.020]   because it's important to me,
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.180]   and I wanna live true to my values,
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.540]   regardless of what happens.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.080]   And so you go do it anyways.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.180]   And so when they would deal with people
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.420]   with severe anxiety, they'd say,
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.700]   you go to the party anyways,
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.620]   and you give the talk anyways, and you do whatever.
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.860]   And I like that.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.740]   And I would say this is a very long way around
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.700]   the saying, the deep life is about living
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.680]   in a value-driven way, despite everything else that happens.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.940]   Not about creating a life that these specific
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.940]   good things happen and there is no bad.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.380]   That's called the fantasy life.
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:51.060]   That's not a life that you're gonna achieve.
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.180]   No one achieves that life.
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.860]   We all have our issues.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.820]   I had to deal with the anxiety with the sleep thing.
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.340]   I don't have, I have not classic panic attacks,
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.540]   but I've gone through, I have weird stuff happens to me
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.900]   I have whatever, autonomic nervous system,
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.420]   panic attack style reactions.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.820]   I've had this all the time.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:16.020]   Faint, I'll have like a severe sort of,
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.680]   I'll get lightheaded and like my whole body
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.660]   will break out in sweat.
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.960]   Like, look, man, I've been through all this stuff.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.140]   And you wanna talk about high stakes.
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.180]   How about like, okay, you're about to go on air
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.180]   on this network, or you're on stage in front of like
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.820]   a huge number of people, or you're here sitting
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.380]   next to the Dean.
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.780]   And so I've gone, so we all have this stuff we go through.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.260]   And because the point is, our goal is not to avoid
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.100]   bad things from happening, avoid bad sensations
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.720]   and have only good things happen to us.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.380]   The goal is to live deeply, to live true to your values
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.100]   despite it, it's the ACT mindset.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.660]   It's the mindset that Russ Harris talks about
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.300]   in "The Happiness Trap".
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.340]   So that's the piece I really, Karan,
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.340]   wanted the focus on here.
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.660]   Is focus on what you can control
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.060]   in building this good life.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.700]   The stuff you can't control will come and go.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.260]   It'll do what it does.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.980]   Whatever, and you can't, a lot of that you can't control.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.580]   Be happy when it's, hey, I'm not feeling this thing
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.860]   I don't like, great, I'm happy.
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.780]   But when it's there, don't be devastated.
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.060]   Be like, crap, but I'm still doing this thing
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.780]   I really find important.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.620]   So I think that's good.
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.580]   Now onto your framework.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.420]   I mean, look, I nerd out on this stuff all the time.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.780]   So yes, I like what you're doing here.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.500]   You're building out a system of different layers.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.420]   You're thinking things through.
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.260]   I think of what you're doing
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.900]   as called a personal operating system
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.460]   that has these different stack layers that meet together.
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.260]   My only word of warning would be,
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.220]   make sure that the fiddling of the knobs
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.660]   doesn't take over the actual living.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.580]   In the end, you actually, life is hard and complicated
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.940]   and some days you're anxious and some days you get sick
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.540]   and you're out of commission for two weeks
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.580]   and you can't follow your system.
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.580]   And you wanna make sure that in the end,
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.260]   you're present and have gratitude
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.340]   and you're doing interesting things
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.420]   and enjoying good moments
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.500]   and that you're not spending all your time
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.420]   thinking about your system.
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.100]   But I'm glad you're thinking about it.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.020]   I like your heuristics, try them.
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.700]   If they don't work, change them.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.740]   Feel free to simplify them if you feel stressed
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.300]   by just the complexity of your system.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.540]   I think that's all fine.
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.420]   But let's go back to this original point
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:16.060]   is the goal of the deep life here is not to avoid the bad.
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.500]   It is to live good
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.020]   even when the inevitable bad comes and goes.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.020]   (upbeat music)
