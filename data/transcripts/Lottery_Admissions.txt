[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220]   - Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai,
[00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.360]   and in this podcast episode,
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.400]   I want to talk about admissions to schools,
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.320]   whether it's better to use an entrance exam
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.280]   or to use a lottery system,
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.440]   and I'm inspired by the presidential debates in this episode
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.440]   which is why I have my wife, Sydney,
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.440]   who is going to argue why the lottery system is a no-no
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.120]   and why she'd rather have an entrance exam,
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.600]   and I'll argue the other side and say,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.680]   "Hey, I think a lottery system is the way to go."
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.640]   So what's going on here is that
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.000]   at Lowell High School in San Francisco,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.880]   it's a top-magnet school, it requires an entrance exam,
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.960]   you gotta pass that exam,
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.200]   and you gotta have a top-tier GPA in middle school,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.640]   and that entrance exam has been abolished
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.840]   for a lottery system,
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.760]   which is what every single other high school,
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.640]   middle school, and elementary school in San Francisco
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.480]   is under.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.320]   It's a lottery system where you may or may not get
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.600]   your local neighborhood school
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.000]   that's a couple blocks away,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.360]   and if you lose the lottery,
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.120]   you might end up at a school 30 minutes away,
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.160]   which has really kind of befuddled
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.060]   and angered a lot of parents in San Francisco,
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.080]   but that's just the way it is.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.960]   Yes, there are some weightings
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.920]   where you can have a higher weighting
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.760]   because you're living in the neighborhood,
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.080]   but at the end of the day, it's a lottery,
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.360]   and you really don't know what you're gonna get,
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.160]   and so therefore, you gotta rank
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.400]   something like 10 schools,
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.640]   and hopefully, you'll get your top five,
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.480]   and you just go from there.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.560]   So now, Lowell High School is just like
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.620]   every other high school.
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.880]   Thanks to the global pandemic,
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.200]   the school board voted unanimously
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.280]   to eliminate the entrance exam for 2021
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.760]   and 2022 school year because there's no grades,
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.640]   and there are no exams to be evaluated for entrance,
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.320]   and that's kind of crazy because as of late October 2020,
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.920]   public schools are not open in San Francisco.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.960]   This is a problem because the kids in public school
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.240]   are probably falling behind to those kids
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.920]   who are in private school or charter schools
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.720]   who have started the school year a month earlier,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.920]   and there are talks that school won't open until January,
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.520]   so that is really a big concern.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.200]   So the heart of the matter comes down to equality
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.920]   as an equal access to opportunity.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.800]   Opponents of the entrance exam claim
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.320]   that the system is elitist and racist
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.920]   given the high school is a public institution,
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.480]   and it's not accessible to everyone.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.040]   Not everyone is born with two parents who are wealthy,
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.960]   who have unlimited resources.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.960]   There are a lot of households
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.600]   who are single-parent households
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.340]   who don't have the resources or time
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.720]   to take care of their kids.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.120]   So of course, there's gonna be a lot of inequities
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.520]   growing up, and the people who do have the resources,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.920]   who are able to study for many, many hours
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.520]   are gonna be able to get into schools like Lowell
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.200]   and Thomas Jefferson in Washington, D.C.,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.320]   and Stuyvesant in New York City and so forth.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.200]   And so I just wanted to have a conversation
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.720]   and really a debate, I guess, with my wife
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.480]   regarding the lottery system and the entrance exam.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.040]   And so, Sydney, I want you to argue
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.200]   why you believe that the entrance exam,
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.920]   which is based on a meritocracy,
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.360]   one would say, is the better way.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.600]   So Sydney, why do you think Lowell High School
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.320]   should have kept its entrance exam
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.920]   that it's had for decades now?
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.560]   - So Lowell is one of 25 public high schools
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.600]   in San Francisco, so it's not affecting
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.460]   the majority of high school students.
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.980]   And there are also enough high-quality high schools
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.980]   in San Francisco besides Lowell.
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.200]   And in addition, I think there are kids
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.520]   who have been preparing to go to Lowell
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.880]   specifically based on the reputation that the school has,
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.880]   their academic record, and studying extra hard.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.700]   They feel they deserve a chance to get into that school
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.700]   based on their merit versus some random lottery selection.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.720]   And another point that people are making
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.920]   is that Lowell is a very diverse school.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.300]   If you look at the breakdown of the student body,
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.720]   there are 61% Asian, 11% Hispanic,
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.880]   8% students who are two or more races.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.720]   So saying that Lowell needs to be more diverse
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.800]   doesn't seem to be a super strong argument.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.380]   - Do you think Asian people are considered minorities?
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.920]   For those who are arguing for the lottery system,
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.640]   it seems as if they are not treating Asians as minorities.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.720]   - Right, well, I think there's about 6% Asian people
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.040]   in America, and so obviously there's a 10x
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.440]   overrepresentation of Asian people at Lowell High School
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.140]   with 61% of the population who's Asian.
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.880]   So the minority that you forgot or you didn't get to
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.880]   was the black population of only 2% at Lowell.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.760]   And then the Hawaiian Native Pacific Islander population
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.160]   of only 1%.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.240]   So I think the goal of the lottery system
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.600]   is to try to have the representation
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.840]   of the school population be more representative
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.680]   of the city population.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.760]   - The black population of San Francisco
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.800]   is still pretty low, though, isn't it?
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.520]   - Well, let's take a look at the latest Census Bureau data.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.800]   It says San Francisco population is 45% white,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.760]   5.2% black.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.000]   There you go, you're right.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.480]   The population is pretty low,
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.360]   but it's still higher than the 2% at Lowell.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.120]   But I guess that's not that huge of a difference.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.520]   I thought it was gonna be much wider.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.980]   34% Asian, 8% some other race,
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.400]   and then 0.3% Native American.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.400]   So 34% Asian, and then 61% Asian population at Lowell.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.920]   5.2% black population, and only 2% at Lowell.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.080]   So what it looks like is that the San Francisco
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.600]   Unified School District Board, or whatever,
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.160]   is trying to make these percentages at Lowell
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.040]   more equal to the city population,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.600]   which I think is a reasonable goal.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.480]   What do you think?
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.200]   - Well, my side of the argument isn't focused on race,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.840]   it's focused on merit.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.000]   - Well-- - Academic achievement.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   - But my belief is that merit,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.120]   there's not really a true meritocracy.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.680]   There's no such thing as true meritocracy,
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.000]   and it has to do with race,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.360]   because this is the underlying reason, I think,
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.280]   why they're going to a lottery system,
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.120]   is to make it more equal for underrepresented minorities.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.280]   And so the underrepresented minorities
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.920]   are the black and Hispanic population
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.520]   in San Francisco at Lowell High School.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.280]   - But if we look at the numbers,
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.120]   the student body has 11% Hispanic,
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.560]   and San Francisco has roughly 15%,
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.360]   so that's not that big of a difference.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.360]   And the white population of San Francisco is 40%,
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.560]   however, at Lowell, it's all the way down to 18%.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.840]   So that's the biggest difference between,
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.840]   if you look at race of the student body
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.080]   versus San Francisco as a city.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.560]   - So it sounds like maybe, actually,
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.360]   the lottery system is to try to help white people,
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.840]   because they're the most underrepresented, not minority,
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.720]   they're the most underrepresented racial group
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.680]   at Lowell High School.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.920]   - You could say it that way.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.640]   - So that's actually something really interesting
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.480]   that you pointed out regarding
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.440]   the white percentage difference.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.000]   Right, if it's 40% population
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.600]   and only 18% representation at Lowell,
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   that is what, 22% differential,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.520]   22 percentage point differential,
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.640]   whereas the black differential
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.000]   is only a three percentage point differential.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.800]   And so yeah, the lottery system
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.920]   will actually help white people more, right?
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.240]   And maybe black people, and maybe Hispanic people,
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.120]   and probably not Asian people,
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.600]   because there's such a massive over-representation.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.160]   - All right, so using race as a reason
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.680]   to abolish the admissions exam
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.400]   doesn't really seem to make a lot of sense
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.240]   if it's to help underrepresented minorities,
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.640]   when, when we've looked at the numbers,
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.440]   the white population could end up benefiting the most.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.680]   - Well, it probably should end up benefiting the most,
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.880]   because like in any lottery system,
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.400]   whether it's NBA, draft pick lottery, NFL,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.800]   I think, let's talk about the NBA draft lottery.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.000]   The bottom line is,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.680]   if you have a greater percentage representation,
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.000]   you have a greater percentage chance of winning the lottery.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.680]   It's very correlated.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.040]   So white people have 40% of the population,
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.000]   so they're gonna win the lottery 40% of the time.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.400]   It's very consistent.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.680]   I think that's how it works.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.800]   And therefore, I think you're right.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.560]   The lottery system,
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.840]   which is supposed to make things more equal,
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.120]   will make things more equal for white people.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.800]   And you say it that way, could be.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.040]   - It could be.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.280]   I mean, I think that's the truth.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.720]   That's math.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.920]   Unless, you know, like you're a white kid
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.240]   and you win the lottery to Lowell High School
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.320]   or, you know, Thomas Jefferson or whatever,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.160]   and you say, you know what, I don't wanna go.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.840]   And that's kind of one of the arguments that I've heard
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.800]   is that white kids, white parents are intimidated.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.840]   They don't wanna send their kids to Lowell High School
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.640]   because they would be the minorities.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.160]   And that's pretty interesting
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.760]   because that's what minorities face all the time
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.360]   when they do anything, join an organization, go to school.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.160]   Minorities are always the minorities by definition.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.000]   And so, you know, welcome to the minority world, folks.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.920]   All right, so we've got some progress,
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.640]   but I wanna hear more of your arguments
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.000]   why you think the lottery system
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.640]   is not good for this particular school
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.040]   and maybe other magna-type schools.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.320]   - So Lowell has a reputation
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.680]   for being very academically rigorous,
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.120]   very competitive.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.640]   The students are under a lot of pressure.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.880]   So if you throw a bunch of unprepared kids
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.480]   into that type of environment,
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.160]   they're probably not going to thrive.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.760]   They may struggle, they may get frustrated and stressed out,
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.600]   they may wanna quit and just drop out.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.680]   It's hard to say.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.360]   It could be very tough on them.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360]   - Yeah.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.760]   And I guess if you have bad grades from a good school,
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.840]   I think that's worse than getting good grades
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.280]   from a bad school, a mediocre school,
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.520]   because a lot of these universities,
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.400]   they're not gonna just accept everyone from the best school.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.040]   They wanna diversify their student body pool as well.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:09.920]   - Yeah.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.360]   - All right, are there any other arguments
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.080]   you have against the lottery system?
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.560]   - I'll just throw one more in there.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.040]   So teachers tend to be attracted
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.960]   to good schools with good students.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.720]   They want to teach, that's their passion.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.160]   So they wanna be able to help students
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.720]   who are interested and who are excited
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.800]   about being there.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.520]   If all of a sudden they have students
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.640]   who are frustrated and struggling
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.360]   'cause they simply can't keep up with the curriculum,
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.360]   that's gonna be not only frustrating for those students,
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.120]   it's gonna be difficult for the teachers as well,
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.640]   which may over time lead those good teachers
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.480]   to go to another school,
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.960]   potentially in the private sector
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.120]   instead of staying in the public school system.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:54.960]   We just don't know.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.960]   - Do you think that students rise to the top
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.920]   and get better as a whole
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.600]   or do you think they rise to the, don't rise,
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.920]   they just fall to the bottom as a whole?
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.200]   - I'm sure that personality has a lot to do with it.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.240]   So I don't know that you can make
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.400]   a generalized argument that way.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.120]   It's hard to say.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.600]   I think if you are maybe not the brightest student
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.560]   in the class but you're not that far behind,
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.560]   you might be inspired to try to learn like your peers
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.300]   and try to get good grades like they do.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.600]   But if there's too much of a gap,
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.800]   I think it's just demotivating.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.000]   - Do you really think there's that big
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.400]   of a gap of intelligence?
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.520]   - I have no idea but--
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.600]   - I mean, just let's recall high school in our days.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.080]   - Well, weren't we looking at some article the other day
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.120]   that was showing literacy or something like that,
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.840]   breakdown by race for the San Francisco School District.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.400]   - I don't remember.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.240]   I don't remember.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.200]   But I'm just trying to ask you directly.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.480]   In your school, did you notice a huge gap?
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.480]   - In my public school, yes.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.320]   - Yeah?
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.080]   - Yeah, there was a very broad range and--
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.760]   - And wasn't there like gifted
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.720]   and talented programs or whatever?
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.480]   - There was, there was but not for, I don't think,
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.920]   I mean, it was a long time ago.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.800]   My memory's not the sharpest.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.040]   But I think it was only for certain subjects.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.840]   It wasn't for every single subject.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.440]   - Right.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.640]   I don't know, I just feel that,
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.800]   I mean, how much do you remember of college,
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.440]   what you learned in college or in high school?
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.840]   - You know, it's a small percentage, I would say.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.440]   And I think most people would agree with that.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.880]   I do think it's important to teach a broad range of subjects.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.720]   - Yeah.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.640]   - Did I need to really understand chemistry or physics?
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.800]   No, but I'm glad I was exposed to it.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.680]   It helped me realize in high school
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.800]   that I did not wanna take a career
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.200]   that would require physics
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.360]   'cause it was just way too hard for me.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.200]   - Okay.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.320]   Well, I just wanna argue against the entrance exam.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.160]   - Okay, let's hear it.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160]   - Against meritocracy.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.880]   One, because I think there's no true meritocracy.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.120]   Nobody is born with equal opportunity.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.880]   We know this, you know this.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.520]   Some people are born wealthy,
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.400]   some people have two parents,
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.160]   some people have stay-at-home parents,
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.560]   and some people are born strictly into poverty.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.960]   You cannot pit these students together
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.880]   and expect them to have the same outcome
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.840]   when they don't have the same opportunity.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.140]   It just isn't that way.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.260]   So when you have an entrance exam,
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.140]   what you're testing for,
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.560]   what you're testing for are the people
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.160]   who have the most opportunity to study,
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.680]   to learn, to have extra resources and so forth.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.120]   So what you're doing is you're siloing
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.920]   these people who have the most opportunity
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.160]   to have more opportunity as they get older.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.920]   And the people who didn't have the opportunity,
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.200]   who are not gonna get those good grades,
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.800]   who don't have those high test scores,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   are not gonna get bunched in with these other people.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.280]   And that gap is gonna continue to widen
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.160]   in school, in college, in the workplace
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.600]   for generations and generations to come.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.440]   - Even though Lowell is only one of 25 schools?
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.840]   - Well, why do we have to do one,
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.960]   why don't we make them all the same?
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.880]   Why does it have to be this one school out there
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.000]   being the iconoclast and saying, "We're different"?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.480]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.960]   - And so in a world where the rich are getting much richer,
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.680]   we've seen this during the pandemic,
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.720]   it's a K-shaped recovery, right?
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.000]   The investor class, the super wealthy,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.880]   the mega millionaires, the billionaires
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.340]   are just raking it in,
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.440]   while the working class are losing their jobs
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.440]   and they're hurting, right?
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.920]   Do we want that to continue?
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.880]   I don't think we want that to continue.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.480]   And there needs to be an artificial way
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.840]   to break the cycle if we're truly
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.960]   to help those who have less opportunity.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.120]   And so introducing a lottery system
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.640]   is not the cure-all, end-all, right?
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.240]   It's, okay, here is a chance to break
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.680]   what has been happening for the past several decades
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.340]   and see what can happen.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.840]   Maybe there will be a lot of good
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.120]   that comes out of the lottery system
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.960]   with different types of students
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.000]   from different backgrounds, and they can build upon it.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.360]   It shouldn't be this 40-year inertia
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.760]   of the way things are.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.760]   We should change, I think, and evolve to help society.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.840]   You know, one of the things I hear a lot
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.980]   about going from an entrance exam to a lottery system
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.880]   is that it's very anti-Asian.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.680]   And the reason why it's anti-Asian
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.040]   is because the majority population is Asian, right?
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.400]   61% at Lowell, things like 70%
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.760]   at Thomas Jefferson High School.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.560]   And it's very similar at a lot of these schools.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.080]   If you look at the UC system,
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.560]   I think it's like 50% Asian at UC Berkeley.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.140]   So if you go to a lottery system,
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.760]   that takes away meritocracy,
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.780]   takes away people who are studying hard
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.260]   to try to pass these exams and get good grades.
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.840]   And I think, unfortunately, the result is
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.280]   that there will be less qualified Asian students
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.120]   who are gonna enter these schools.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.280]   However, we must not forget
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.140]   about the relativity of racism in this country.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.320]   So black folks, they've been around for hundreds of years.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.880]   They've had slavery to deal with.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.640]   They've had systemic racism
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.280]   with regards to the banking sector, housing sector,
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.360]   every aspect of society,
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.500]   and we're still trying to right these wrongs
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.840]   and rectify the situation today.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.200]   I'm not saying that Asian people
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.720]   have not faced a similar amount of discrimination in America.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.880]   They haven't, actually.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.040]   It's a different level of racism.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.600]   I've experienced plenty of racism growing up in Virginia
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.680]   for high school and college,
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.960]   but it's a different level of racism.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.520]   And so I believe, why not?
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.960]   Why not try to boost that population at Lowell High School
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.760]   from the 2% it is now to the 5%?
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.900]   It's still not a big percentage, but it can happen.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.560]   It can happen with some effort and with some changes.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.040]   And 61% Asian population
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.240]   versus a much lower San Francisco Asian population,
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.000]   I think it says it for itself.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.960]   There is a lot of benefit to the Asian community already.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.720]   Yes, of course, there are first-generation Asian Americans
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.200]   and poor Asian Americans,
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.080]   and the reality is, look, life is complicated,
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.120]   and we're just gonna have to figure out.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.120]   If you can't get into Lowell, don't worry,
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.260]   because you're gonna have your fundamentals down pat.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.880]   You studied hard, you prepared,
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.280]   nothing is ever gonna be easy street your entire life.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.660]   You're gonna find different ways to get ahead.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.660]   I think at the end of the day, this is a public school.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.860]   So given it's a public school,
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.680]   everybody should have access to the school.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.000]   Now, of course, not every public school
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.220]   can accommodate everybody
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.980]   because there are classroom size limitations.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.860]   However, there needs to be a way,
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.820]   an equitable way to gain access to the school
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.940]   if you want to attend that school,
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.840]   and that's how the lottery system is.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.420]   If the lottery system is truly a random system,
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.140]   that is the most equitable way possible.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.020]   All right, what's done is done.
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.880]   It's gone to a lottery system,
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.380]   and we can't do anything about it.
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.580]   We'll see what happens a year from now.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.560]   And I just wanna ask you, Cindy,
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.600]   what if our kids are in middle school
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.680]   and Lowell was still a lottery system admissions?
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.580]   What do you think?
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.300]   What would we do?
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.480]   - I think a lot will depend
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.920]   how our kids are doing academically.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.100]   If they're doing very well
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:47.000]   and Lowell is still teaching at an above average,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.080]   what would you call it?
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:49.920]   - Level?
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.080]   - Above average level, okay,
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.800]   then I would think they could do well.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.140]   But if they were struggling,
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.640]   I don't think putting them in an environment
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.060]   where there's a lot of competition
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.700]   and it's really intense,
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.200]   the coursework is really hard,
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.560]   I wouldn't want our kids to be frustrated
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.160]   and feel like they're just lagging behind all the time.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.720]   Nobody feels good in that kind of situation.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.880]   - Imagine if you always felt like
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.340]   one of the dumbest people in class.
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:27.380]   That would be bad, right?
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.920]   - That hurts your self-confidence
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.960]   and I think a lot of high school students,
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.100]   they're under so much pressure
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.380]   with social media and all that stuff.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.220]   And if they're struggling with self-confidence
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:45.240]   outside of academics to then throw on academic stress,
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.820]   I think it's just too much for a teenager to deal with.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:49.660]   - You think so?
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.580]   - Maybe we're just, what do some people say, snowflakes?
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.500]   Maybe we're just so soft on the next generation,
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.380]   every single generation gets softer and softer and softer
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.340]   to the point where they're really not getting challenged
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.980]   and struggling as they should
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.180]   before they enter the real world.
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.400]   'Cause the real world is not a very friendly place.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.600]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.620]   - I think at the end of the day,
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.300]   you gotta know your own child
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.180]   and see what their maximum tolerance
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.900]   for discomfort, stress, and pain is.
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.660]   And maybe try to get close to the max,
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.740]   maybe like 80% of the max, but don't go to the max,
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:34.300]   otherwise they might just turn out to be massively rebellious
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.660]   and not bother to study, maybe they'll do drugs,
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.500]   do all that stuff.
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.860]   So it's just such a tricky situation.
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.740]   - It's hard, parenting is hard.
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.420]   - And you don't really know
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.020]   what a school environment is like.
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.380]   - Right, you're not there unless you're the actual student.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.220]   - Unless you're a student,
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.700]   and then the student only gets usually one perspective
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.060]   because students aren't going to multiple high schools,
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.460]   well, not normal students, right?
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.420]   They'll just have to suck it up and go through one.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.380]   - Yeah, it's hard to say.
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.660]   - I think for us, if our kids cannot get into
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:11.420]   a well-rated public school that's within 15 minutes driving,
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.900]   hopefully that's 15 minutes walking,
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.540]   I think we're gonna have to homeschool
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.980]   or go to private school.
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.300]   That seems like the logical solution.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.940]   - Yeah, I do think it's silly that some students
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.860]   have to go to a school that's all the way across the city
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.580]   and deal with traffic,
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.620]   'cause I don't even think San Francisco
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.140]   has a school bus system.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.580]   I think they have to take MUNI,
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.860]   which is our public transportation.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.420]   - MUNI or your parents' drive.
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.740]   - Right, and MUNI is so low.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.140]   - Right, and that's the sad thing.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.100]   I don't think the lottery system
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.500]   is really working, unfortunately.
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.660]   I think if we're honest, you look at the data,
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.820]   the wealthier families, the white families,
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.060]   dominate the private school system,
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.340]   and minorities and poor families,
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.300]   and just normal middle-class families,
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.620]   dominate the public school system.
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.780]   So I think there needs to be some kind of change.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.260]   We can't just focus absolutely on equality,
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.260]   equality, equality of opportunity,
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.300]   and then not look at the resulting data.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.220]   And I think one commenter said something really smart,
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:21.220]   and that is, we should focus on equality of opportunity,
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:25.980]   but we can't focus on equality of outcome.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:30.100]   We cannot say, hey, you guys have all the same opportunity,
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.780]   and you guys will all end up multimillionaires
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.020]   by the age of 30.
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.980]   We know that life is complicated.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.180]   There's so many variables, a lot of lucky breaks,
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.940]   connections, all that stuff,
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.460]   that'll determine your actual outcome.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.620]   So I thought that was a really, really smart
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.620]   and poignant comment, so thank you very much for that.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.900]   And I wanna leave you guys with this one thought,
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:57.300]   and that is, it's so weird to think about education
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.660]   and just that hustle and grind
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.740]   to get into these best schools possible.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.660]   For what?
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.740]   For what, to get into a prestigious university?
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.420]   I don't know, as a 43-year-old now,
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.260]   I look back and I'm like,
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.340]   I don't care where you went to university.
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.500]   I care what you do, I care what your character is,
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.580]   and if you lead a purposeful life.
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.820]   And people wanna get into a prestigious university
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.860]   so they can get a prestigious job,
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.100]   maybe make a lot of money,
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.540]   or maybe they can get into politics
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.940]   and get a lot of power and fame.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.140]   And I look at that, I'm thinking,
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.460]   why do you want fame and power?
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.660]   I think that's so overrated.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.660]   That's like a prison of your own making.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:37.460]   But in terms of money, yes, money definitely is great
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.620]   because it can buy freedom,
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.540]   but after a certain amount of money,
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.180]   again, it doesn't lift happiness at all.
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.180]   I think it makes a lot of people miserable
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.340]   because they're constantly chasing more money
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:51.220]   and more status, climbing that corporate ladder.
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.740]   It's just so interesting to me
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:57.220]   now that we're so far removed from that way of living.
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.780]   I mean, what are your thoughts on status,
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.580]   money, and all that stuff?
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.100]   What's the point of all this
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.860]   if we don't even remember much of
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.380]   what we learned in college and high school?
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.340]   - I know.
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.220]   Maybe it's about seeing what your maximum potential is
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.900]   and finding yourself in the process.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.780]   - Yeah, I think that's good.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.140]   It's good to see what your max potential is
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.020]   because you develop a feeling of what if
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:27.020]   and kind of regret not trying to go as far as you can
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.660]   in your studies or in your career
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:33.540]   or playing a sport, even recreationally.
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:37.740]   So trying to discover your max potential is important.
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.140]   And I think at the same time,
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:43.340]   we've got to just realize if we've done our best,
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.420]   that's all we can ask for.
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.260]   Alrighty, well, let's just wrap up this podcast episode.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.900]   Thanks so much for arguing with me.
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.500]   - Thank you.
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.340]   - We'd love to hear from you guys
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.300]   on whether it's better to have a lottery system
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.380]   or an entrance exam.
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.140]   I've written a pretty detailed post
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.940]   on the pros and cons of everything
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.820]   and also our personal thoughts and what we do.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.340]   So check out the post and stick around
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.100]   and we'll talk to you guys later.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.460]   - Thank you. - Take care.
