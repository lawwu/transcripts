[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   What are your sources of motivation?
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.960]   And I'm going to guess that some of them are internal.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.420]   We could point to head or we could point to heart, doesn't really matter.
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.720]   But like when you think of sources of motivation, do you have a palette of them that you can
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.080]   dip into?
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.120]   Do you even feel the need to dip into them or is it really just all about action steps
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.600]   throughout your day?
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.060]   Or if I can even venture into the somewhat, you know, harder stories that I've heard you
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.040]   talk about, do you sometimes think back and you're like, listen, I'm going to do this
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.240]   because there are a bunch of guys that are dead now that can't.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.880]   And so I'm going to do it because I can.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.480]   What are your, what are the paints on your motivation palette, if you will?
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.840]   Well, you probably, you probably heard me say that motivation isn't something that I
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.160]   am going to count on because it's just an emotion that's going to come and go.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.720]   And it's just like feeling happy.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.720]   You feel happy right now.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.280]   Maybe you won't feel happy in 15 minutes.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.280]   You feel sad now.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.840]   Maybe you won't feel sad in 15 minutes, you feel motivated right now.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.480]   You might not feel motivated in 15 minutes, therefore I can't rely on it.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.840]   So I'm not going to put any, I'm not going to put any money on just being motivated because
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.320]   it doesn't really matter to me.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.400]   So the daily actions that I take aren't from motivation.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.400]   They're just from discipline.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.200]   Like I said earlier, I'm not going to get up and go through some big debate about, well,
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.160]   do I really feel like doing this?
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.220]   No, I don't feel like doing this, but it doesn't matter.
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.120]   I'm just going to go do it.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:57.680]   Now if we start to look at sort of a broader movement through life and continuing to try
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:09.240]   and move forward and move on, you know, uh, my buddy Seth died and he was the Delta platoon
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:20.360]   commander in tasking to bruiser and he, he died in 2017 and it was in a parachute accident.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.240]   And it was, it was, I mean, it's definitely unexpected.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.520]   Um, and, and also he'd already been through multiple deployments, um, was with, with us,
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.720]   with me in the battle of Ramadi.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.680]   He then went back into solder city and, and led a ton of very dangerous operations.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.360]   And then he did other deployments and was kind of done with his deployments, kind of
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.520]   done.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   And now he's just talking about when he's going to retire and he's a couple of years
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   away from retirement.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.760]   And, you know, I'm talking about, Hey, we're going to work together again.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.400]   And it all seems like we're on a pretty good path to just move forward.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.800]   And then he ends up dying in a, in a parachute accident.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.960]   And he's a guy that, you know, was really just kind of, you're, you're, you're not going
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:21.960]   to be able to replace any, any, you can't, there's a uniqueness to him that is, you're
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.960]   not going to find.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.200]   And, you know, I've got some stuff that he wrote, he was an incredible writer and I will
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.000]   like try and write something like him.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.320]   I can't, we can't do it because he had a bigger vocabulary and a more articulate way of writing.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.160]   And so I can't write anything as well as he wrote it.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160]   He was incredible at guitar.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:49.080]   He played guitar, played ukulele, like sick, like an incredible at playing guitar.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.480]   And he's a total knuckle dragger, like a total meathead knuckle dragger.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.400]   You know, his nickname was unfrozen caveman because he just, he just, you know, look like
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.200]   a big caveman.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.160]   And yet he spoke French and, you know, could recite French poetry and was really good at
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.120]   learning languages.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.880]   And he was an artist and he had, you know, what's synesthesia is, you know what that
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.880]   is?
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.880]   Emerging of the senses.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.040]   So people, they can see colors and.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.560]   So he didn't know what it was.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.560]   Oh, sorry.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.560]   I see colors.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.560]   I hope most people can see colors.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.560]   Sorry.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.000]   That can hear colors and, and can associate particular colors with sound or like particular
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.320]   keys on the piano.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.040]   It's, it's, it's pretty rare.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.400]   Some people think they have it, but true synesthetics are pretty rare, but they don't have to fight
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.440]   for this trait.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.120]   It just kind of emerges for them.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.240]   He didn't know it, but one day he was talking to me and he was embarrassed to tell me, he's
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.520]   like, you know, what's weird is when I, when I think of numbers, I, I have colors in my
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.720]   head and, and I go, what do you mean?
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.280]   He, and he says hollow was zero.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.480]   And I remember seven is yellow.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.560]   I don't remember any of that, but he, he just rattled off like one, two, three, four, five,
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.560]   six, seven, eight, nine.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.760]   You know, he says, you know, hollow, white, clear, all of, you know, just rattled off
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   these colors.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.480]   So he had this, this, he had that synesthesia and it gave him some kind of weird ability
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.960]   to memorize numbers.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.120]   So, you know, he'd be in a bar and talk to some girl and he'd say, what's your number?
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.200]   And he would just, he would know it for two years.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.720]   He would just know it.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.760]   And that also made him incredibly good at playing guitar because now like the scale
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.080]   and the fret board of a guitar is this, it's a mathematical thing that he has all in this
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.200]   weird, this weird coloration scenario going on.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:45.240]   So there's, so he's this guy and you know, and, and very, a very emotional guy, a very
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.280]   emotional guy who would, you know, you know, I was talking earlier about being a balance
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.280]   for someone.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.980]   I had to balance this dude out on a daily basis sometimes, you know, he'd be so mad
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.800]   about something, you know, one, one day he'd be, I hate the teams, I hate all these guys.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.360]   And I'd say, yeah, I get it, man.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.320]   And the next day I'm on never getting out of the teams, you know, he would, he would
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.080]   oscillate that bad.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.520]   And I would tell him, Hey, you're, Hey bro, you're oscillating again.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.040]   And just would do anything.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:19.240]   And he, and he loved his guys and would do anything for his guys.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:29.520]   And so when he died, you know, we're, we're at his, we're at his, it's not his funeral.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.560]   It's before the funeral.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.640]   It's like the, the open casket thing, the wake thing.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:44.800]   And myself, his brother, Alex, Leif Babin, who I wrote extreme ownership with, and JP
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.360]   Dinell, who's one of my brothers who, who works with us at Echelon Front now is with
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.040]   us in Ramadi and was very close to Seth.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.800]   And we're like, everyone kind of cleared out for us.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:08.120]   And we, we go in there and I think JP gave him, JP had one of those memorial bracelets
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.680]   with guys' names on it that had died and JP gave that to him.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.140]   And I think Leif gave him some surf wax cause also Seth was a, was a surfer.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:23.440]   And and I gave Seth his black belt cause he started training jujitsu with me and he had,
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.880]   he had his purple belt, he'd gotten his purple belt.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.440]   I gave him his black belt and, and everyone was just quiet.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:41.240]   And you know, JP was telling the story the other day and, and I just said, we will not
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:08:04.920]   fail him, meaning that him, Mark, Mikey, Chris, Seth, and countless other guys, they, they're
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   not here.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.720]   They don't have the opportunity to do the things we do.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.040]   They don't have, they only have the opportunity to get up in the morning.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:20.360]   So that's what it is, man.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.400]   I won't fail those guys.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:30.960]   [Music]
