[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   The last thing to book was our rental car in Mallorca, and wow, it was very cheap.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.340]   So it didn't matter where I looked.
[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.920]   For four days, it was going to be somewhere between $100 and $200.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.020]   As I always do, I looked on AutoSlash first because it's just a great comparison site.
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.820]   And then I went to the individual rental car company websites because sometimes AutoSlash
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.120]   won't search any special kind of discounts you have.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.760]   And so with Hertz and National, there is a discount associated with having an Amex Platinum
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.760]   card.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.000]   First, I had a discount from Founder's Card.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.360]   Surprisingly, those discounts were all much better than the AutoSlash rates.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.760]   And I'd heard some horror stories when I was looking online for renting cars in Mallorca
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.240]   that during the summer it can be crazy and you show up and your car's not there or you
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.020]   have to wait a few hours.
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.200]   And all these reservations were pay at the counter.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.160]   You didn't have to prepay anything.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.960]   So I booked a car at Hertz, and then I booked a backup car at Sixt half an hour later.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.520]   They're both around $150 for four days.
