[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   Here's a question from the inbox.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.600]   Dear Pastor John, my name is Jeremy, a 30-year-old living and working in Hollywood.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.420]   My question is about the Tower of Babel, where God confused their language as punishment.
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.640]   Was this the beginning of all other ethnicities separate from Israel?
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.760]   I've always stumbled over the vast racial representation on earth stemming from just
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.480]   Adam and Eve or just from Noah.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.860]   Does the Bible imply anything about this or is it simply a mystery?
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.160]   Let me try to give what I think is a probable answer to the question as it relates to the
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.800]   Tower of Babel and Noah, but then shift the focus onto what the Apostle Paul does with
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:56.600]   this answer, which I think is far more important than the precise answer to when and how all
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.080]   the thousands of different ethnicities came into being.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:09.780]   After the flood, in Genesis 9, verse 19, it says, "These three were the sons of Noah,
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.440]   and from these the people of the whole earth were dispersed."
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.400]   So, all the people—people, I haven't said peoples yet, I haven't said ethnicities,
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.640]   I'm just saying people—all the people of the earth derive from Noah's offspring.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.160]   Then, at the end of chapter 10, and we haven't gotten to Babel yet, that's chapter 11, at
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:41.400]   the end of chapter 10, verse 32, the author delineates, I mean, in this chapter, he delineates
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.720]   the genealogies, the whole chapter's genealogies of Noah's children.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:54.040]   Then he says, "These are the clans of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies,
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:03.080]   in their nations, and from these the nations, the families, the ethnicities, spread abroad
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.600]   on the earth after the flood."
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.240]   That's Genesis 10, 32.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:17.040]   So here he makes explicit that not just people in general, but nations, different nations,
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.960]   and that's not political nations, but ethno-linguistic nations, families, ethnicities spread across
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.120]   the world.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:36.400]   Then, in chapter 11, surprisingly, comes in kind of reverse chronological order, comes
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.720]   the story of the Tower of Babel, and there we see the immediate cause of the linguistic
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.340]   diversity of the nations that scatter across the lands.
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.760]   They were in rebellion against God, trying to build this tower, as it were, to reach
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:04.560]   into heaven and make a name for themselves, so that God intended for them to be now fractured,
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.120]   so that their rebellion did not have a united front.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.200]   So this is what he says, Genesis 11, 7, "Come, let us go down there and confuse their language,
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.800]   so that they may not understand one another's speech."
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   So the Lord dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, just like he had
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.440]   said in 919, over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.260]   Now the way John Salehammer in his Genesis commentary puts it is like this.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.400]   What he has described, what the author has described geographically and linguistically
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:59.220]   in chapter 10, he will describe theologically in chapter 11, namely God's judgment of Babylon
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.440]   and the dispersion of the nations.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.400]   Now here's one of those paradoxes in God's ruling over the history of the world.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.300]   On the one hand, the division of humanity into languages and ethnicities was a kind
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.240]   of judgment.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:24.760]   Nevertheless, on the other hand, it was clearly part of God's overarching intention in the
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:33.960]   plan of salvation that Christ would be known and loved and praised, not by a single ethnicity,
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:42.240]   but by thousands of peoples and ethnicities and languages, because Christ gets more glory
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.920]   by being honored from a diversity of peoples than a single people.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.600]   So this is another example of how evil in the world is orchestrated and overruled by
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.280]   God for Christ-exalting, saving purposes in the end.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:09.120]   Now watch the apostle Paul, watch what he does with the diversity of peoples when he
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:17.960]   is confronting the ethnocentricity and arrogance of the Athenian elite in Acts 17.26.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:27.560]   Here's what he says, "And God made from one man every nation of mankind to live on
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.360]   the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling."
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:45.100]   So he stresses, "One man and from him every nation, both the so-called brilliant Athenians
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:51.480]   and the so-called barbarians, both of them sprung from one ancestor."
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.920]   In other words, you bright, arrogant, racist men of Athens have the same blood flowing
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.360]   in your veins as the barbarians do whom you despise.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:12.360]   You have the same great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, and Paul does that explicitly to undermine
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:20.440]   the pride and racism and ethnocentrism, arrogance of the Athenian philosophers.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:27.360]   This is the message that Hitler and the Nazis and all white supremacists needed and need
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.840]   to hear.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:37.000]   And then the apostle John elevates the diversity of the nations to an even higher level when
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.080]   he connects it with the purposes of God in the shedding of the blood of Jesus in Revelation
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.080]   5.9.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.720]   "They sang a new song, saying, 'Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:56.400]   seals, for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:03.280]   and language and people and nation, and you made them a kingdom and priest to our God,
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.040]   and they shall reign on earth.'"
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:13.240]   In other words, Christ died in order to ransom and possess a people of his own from a diverse
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.600]   peoples.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.480]   And then in chapter 7, verse 9, John gives a picture of the great final multitude.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:28.160]   "After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude, that no one could number from every
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:35.560]   nation, all tribes and peoples and languages standing before the throne and before the
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.560]   Lamb."
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:44.520]   So, whatever the precise way God brought these diverse ethnicities into being, it is clear
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:51.320]   he intends for us to reach them all with the gospel and count them in Christ as our brothers
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:57.160]   and sisters in the hope of a common kingdom and a common glory.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.160]   Amen.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.000]   That's an incredibly helpful overview, Pastor John.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Thank you.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Excellent question, Jeremy.
