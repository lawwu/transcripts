[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:18.100]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.260]   This is our show where we take questions
[00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.720]   from you the viewers.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.780]   Every week our inbox is full of questions from you.
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.100]   A lot of good ones, sometimes we get them from the chat.
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.100]   We had a bunch of live people in the chat here today.
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.100]   Thanks everyone for joining us.
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.940]   Remember if you have a question,
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.080]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.660]   Duncan, it's been a kind of a rough year
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.100]   for US stocks and bonds.
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.880]   So John, let's throw up the chart here just to show.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.840]   This is a year to date returns for the S&P 500
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.140]   and the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index.
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.240]   S&P's down 6% or so.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.120]   Bonds actually down worse than stocks right now.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.040]   They're also down a little more than 6%.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.940]   This is pretty rare.
[00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.400]   So I looked back until the 1920s.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.520]   When does this happen that stocks and bonds in the US
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.320]   are down in the same year?
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.360]   It's happened four times in history since the late 1920s.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.360]   1931, 1941, 1969, and 2018, just barely.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.240]   Bonds were down just a smidge.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.160]   I actually wrote a eulogy for the 60/40 portfolio
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.300]   back in 2019 because it's getting killed every year
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.920]   since 2008 basically.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.520]   Is the 60/40 dead, is it dead?
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.720]   And I always say, if the 60/40 is dead,
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.960]   that means diversification is dead.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.920]   So people say, all right, this year it's really dead, right?
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.320]   It's gotta be dead.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.600]   Well, my counterpoint to this is diversification
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.440]   might not protect you over days, weeks, months,
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.480]   or even years, but long-term returns of the owns that matter
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.200]   and the long-term returns for a 60/40 portfolio
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.040]   have still been pretty good.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.120]   I looked it up today, 60/40 portfolio in the US
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.400]   over the last 10 years, up 10% per year,
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.440]   including this year.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.280]   - Pretty good.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.140]   - I'm sorry, but you don't get 10% a year for a decade
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.480]   and not expect to see something like this
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.020]   where you get a 5% drawdown in a few months.
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.960]   That's how this works.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.600]   There has to be the risk of a year like 2022
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.720]   to get decent returns over the long haul, right?
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.400]   I think it just has to be this way.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.360]   So I don't think that this year
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.880]   means the markets are broken.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.920]   It means we're in kind of a strange environment.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.020]   Interest rates are rising
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.280]   at the same time stocks are falling
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.320]   and maybe stocks are falling because rates are rising,
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.160]   but I think this is just the way it has to be.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.040]   You have to have this short-term risk
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.840]   to get the long-term gains over the long-term.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.760]   That's how it works.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.760]   - Yeah, I mean, your chart that you shared the other day
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.080]   in an article was what, a savings account
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.440]   is yielding 0.06% on average or something, yeah.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.400]   - Right, yeah, so unfortunately,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.200]   with rates still being relatively low, even in bonds,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.680]   you're gonna have to accept some volatility
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.640]   or in returns over the long-term.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.800]   That's like the trade-off right now.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.360]   All right, let's do our first question here.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.600]   - Okay, so up first, we have a short and sweet one.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.880]   Is there any way to prep for stagflation?
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.400]   Any actionable ideas?
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.720]   - Duncan, do you know what stagflation is?
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.800]   It's like a bachelor party, right?
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.620]   - Not well enough to explain it well.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.200]   - All right, Larry Summers said this the other day
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.840]   of social network fame.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.440]   The Fed's current policy trajectory
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.840]   is likely to lead to stagflation
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.200]   with average unemployment and inflation,
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.840]   both averaging over 5% over the next few years
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.820]   and ultimately a major recession.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.600]   This is basically the 1970s scenario.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.440]   Stagflation is when you have high inflation
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.760]   mixed with growth that doesn't go so much
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.840]   in the U.S. economy, right?
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.360]   So you have sort of a sputtering growth
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.200]   that doesn't do that much.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.360]   You have low growth and you have high inflation, right?
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.880]   Because most of the time, when you have high inflation,
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.840]   you have high economic growth.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.000]   That's what's happening right now.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.720]   A lot of people don't feel that way,
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.400]   but nominal growth last year in the U.S. economy
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.920]   before inflation was like 11%, right?
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.640]   So we had a booming economy,
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.100]   but we also had high inflation.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.920]   Now, the worry is, okay,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.360]   that inflation is gonna get so high,
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.160]   it's gonna impact growth and spending
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.480]   and growth is gonna come down,
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.760]   but inflation is still gonna be there.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.700]   So again, this is the 1970s, so this is a scenario.
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.480]   So honestly, the '70s are the only scenario we have here
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.440]   for an example.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.640]   And I wanna show some differences.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.440]   First of all, let's look at the inflation in the '70s, John.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.280]   That's the first chart.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.800]   Throughout the '70s, the average inflation rate
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.360]   was a little over 7%.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.540]   It had also started the decade.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.200]   It was already rising in the 1960s at like 5% or 6%.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.000]   So it was already pretty high going in.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.160]   Now let's look at the 10-year Treasury.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.680]   This is the biggest difference between now and then.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.980]   The 10-year Treasury averaged almost 8% in the 1970s.
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.960]   It got as low as five and about as high as 11.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.540]   So rates were much, much higher back then than they are now.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.560]   Let's look at the Fed funds rate next.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.280]   This is the federal funds short-term interest rate.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.600]   You see it got as low as 2.25% in the early '70s,
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.100]   got as high as 17.6% by the end
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.680]   as they were trying to stave off inflation.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.180]   So interest rates were much higher.
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.480]   Inflation is about what it is right now,
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.720]   but it was like that for a decade,
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.640]   whereas we've been using it,
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.360]   we've been experiencing it for about a year.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.800]   So the question is, how do we prepare for it?
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.880]   If we're thinking about your portfolio,
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.360]   the easy answer for back then was commodities.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.560]   I think that the GSCI index,
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.880]   which is like the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index,
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.600]   was up like 20% per year.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.620]   Oil was up more than 800% in the '70s.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.160]   Gold actually rose more than 1,000%.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.720]   Now, I think that has just as much to do with the fact
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.000]   that Nixon broke that link of turning gold into cash,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.400]   that he took that convertibility off the table
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.240]   in the early 1970s.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.280]   I think that has much to do with gold rising
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.360]   as did the commodities boom,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.520]   but that certainly has something to do with it.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.280]   So if you look at energy stocks since 2021,
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.800]   they're up 115%.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.080]   So commodities, energy, if we had a stagflation,
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.420]   that would seem to make sense.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.000]   Now, let's look at the earnings real quick
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.840]   from the '70s, too.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.640]   So this is S&P 500 earnings in the 1970s.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.040]   Up 160%, it was actually the second biggest decade ever
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.320]   for earnings, so it was up 9.9% per year.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.300]   So corporations did fantastic
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.240]   because guess what inflation means higher earnings, right?
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.320]   Obviously, on a nominal basis, when you take out the real,
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.320]   it's not quite as good because inflation was 7%.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.160]   Well, let's look at the returns.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.700]   The craziest thing about the '70s,
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.200]   so I looked at stocks, bonds, and cash.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.740]   S&P 500, 10-year treasuries,
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.240]   and then cash is like three-month T-bills,
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.160]   which is basically, think about it as a money market account
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.200]   or a savings account, short-term treasuries.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.480]   Stocks were up 6% per year.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.280]   This is on a nominal basis before inflation.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.240]   Bonds were up 5.4%.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.040]   Cash was up 6.3% per year in the '70s.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.240]   So holding your money in a savings account
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.560]   would have given you a better return
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.400]   than stocks or bonds in the 1970s.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.040]   Obviously, that's because rates were much higher back then,
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.840]   what you were earning on cash,
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.800]   and short-term T-bills was much higher.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.640]   We don't have that now,
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.700]   but that's the hardest part now,
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.100]   is that back then you had the high inflation,
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.220]   but at least you had higher interest rates to help you
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.180]   and safe assets.
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.660]   We don't have that today.
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.940]   Bond rates are still, they've been coming up,
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.580]   but they're still like 2%, right?
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.180]   So you don't have that cushion.
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.380]   That's the biggest difference.
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.140]   Let's show the value versus inflation one here, John.
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.780]   So what I did here is I looked at the outperformance
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.020]   of value versus growth stocks by decade.
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.660]   And then on the bottom there, you can see,
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.900]   I plotted inflation.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.440]   This might be a little confusing to people,
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.980]   but the idea is going from left to right.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.720]   The higher the value is up until the right,
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.280]   that means when inflation is high
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.580]   and value is doing well, value stocks.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.400]   And alternatively, the other way,
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.680]   when inflation is lower in deflation
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.760]   and value is underperforming growth.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.520]   So the 2010s are a prime example.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.800]   Inflation was really, really low
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.280]   and growth outperformed value by a wide margin.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.900]   You can see the one at the very top there,
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.840]   in the 1970s and 1940s, are the two best decades
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.120]   for value stocks, outperforming growth stocks.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.880]   Guess what those two decades have in common?
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.560]   It was the two highest inflation decades
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.860]   we've had on record, right?
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.880]   So if you look at just value and growth this year alone,
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.080]   now again, we're two and a half or three,
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.540]   two and a half, three months into the year.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.040]   The Vanguard value fund is up 1% this year.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.480]   The Vanguard growth fund is down 12%.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.680]   Vanguard small cap value is down 2%.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.000]   The Vanguard small cap growth fund is down 13%.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.760]   So my takeaway from all this is that diversification
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.840]   probably matters more than ever
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.920]   when you have these changing
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.040]   economic environments like this, right?
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.280]   In the 2010s, everyone just said,
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.000]   "Why don't I just own all tech stocks?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.520]   "And that's gonna make my life easy."
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.740]   Tech stocks are getting crushed now
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.280]   because growth is not doing as well,
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.820]   'cause inflation is higher, that favors value stocks.
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.480]   So if we did have a period where growth came in a little bit
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.120]   but inflation stayed high, you would expect
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.360]   that much broader diversification would help you
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.400]   than being narrowly focused on any one sector.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.320]   And then obviously, if you had all your money in commodities
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.640]   and inflation continues to stay high, you'd probably do okay.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.480]   But that's the idea.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.640]   I think diversification now matters more than it ever has.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.760]   - Yeah, it's a huge shift, too,
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.160]   to go from just caring about revenue growth
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.440]   and things like that to commodities, right?
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.360]   How do you gauge something like that?
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.200]   - It is bizarre because we've gone from this shift
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.380]   from digital is the only thing that matters
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.280]   and software and metaverse to,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.800]   oh, I forgot, real world stuff actually matters.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.880]   Commodities, these real inputs, and then supply chains
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.280]   and all the stuff that moving stuff around,
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.240]   that stuff still matters.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.740]   The physical world still matters.
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.640]   And I think that this last 18 months or so
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.120]   has been a pretty good reminder of that.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.280]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.480]   - But I saw stagflation, it's a scary-sounding word, right?
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.720]   You hear that. - Very scary, yeah.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.680]   - It doesn't, like global warming,
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.960]   actually, that's like the worst PR campaign of all time
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.440]   'cause it sounds nice.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.280]   - Yeah. - Like stagflation is--
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.880]   - Should have been called climate catastrophe
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.120]   or something like that. - Yeah, something bad.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.840]   But yeah, stagflation does not sound good
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.720]   and it's not great either.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.240]   So, all right, let's do the next one.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.080]   - Okay.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.720]   Up next we have, how do you find a balance
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.520]   between having a spiderweb of accounts for every purpose,
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.280]   house, down payment, fund, savings, living,
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.540]   giving, emergency fund, et cetera,
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.720]   and having everything go into one checking account
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.720]   with monthly ACHs to the final destinations?
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.640]   Is there a specific system that you suggest
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.400]   to start with when it comes to automating your finances?
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.240]   I could use this one.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.560]   I feel like I have, like, way too many accounts.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.320]   - All right, yeah, I think that's a problem for everyone
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.920]   because there are so many,
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.480]   it's so much easier to have accounts these days
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.840]   'cause there's all these different investing platforms
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.400]   and things to do, so people tend to dabble.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.080]   John, put up the little chart here of my system
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.080]   that I created a couple years ago.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.840]   I showed this in a blog post a while ago.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.040]   The easiest, I do use my checking account as the hub.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.800]   The only thing that comes off the top is 401(k)
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.240]   and my wife had a 403(b) plan.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.040]   That would go off right before you even see it
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.240]   and that makes it easier, I think.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.440]   But the other stuff, it's all automated
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.440]   and the checking account acts as the big hub
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.280]   and that's where all the different stuff comes out of.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.680]   I don't know if it really matters all that much.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.800]   It depends how much you can automate.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.280]   And the great thing about these different accounts these days
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.560]   is that you have the ability to set this stuff on autopilot.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.400]   But I think the places that you start
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.960]   are things like taking your credit card balance
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.280]   and paying it off in full each month.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.560]   You can set that in an automatic checkbox.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.720]   I'm gonna pay it off in full each month
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.240]   so you're not paying interest and extra stuff on there.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.760]   I think the bill pay automatically is easy
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.760]   so that's either through the bank
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.120]   or recurring payments at the companies.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.160]   So hopefully you can do that for your mortgage or rent,
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.000]   your utilities, subscriptions, car payments,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.520]   insurance, phone, cable, all that stuff.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.080]   For me, that's all on autopilot.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.480]   I never wanna think about it.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.960]   It's great because that means you don't pay interest
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.840]   to credit cards, which is really high
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.640]   and can just punch you in the face.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.520]   You don't have to deal with late payments
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.640]   and overdrafts and all this stuff.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.320]   - Yeah, talk about interest rates that never change.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.600]   Like 29.9% APR on a credit card.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.240]   - Yes, I saw a news story the other day saying,
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.080]   the Fed's raising rates,
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.200]   this is gonna impact your credit cards.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.040]   It's like, guess what?
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.760]   Rates came down, credit card rates never came down.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.360]   Those ones are set in stone basically.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.400]   Yeah, they don't.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.000]   The other thing, I have automated charitable contributions.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.560]   We're gonna talk about those a little bit later today,
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.520]   I know, but I mentioned this on the compounded friends
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.820]   a few months ago, but charities love it
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.000]   when you have this set up on autopilot
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.480]   so they can plan their budgets out a little better.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.320]   I also think that one of the things you can do automatically
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.240]   is save for infrequent purchases
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.280]   that you know will happen on occasion, right?
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.760]   So things like car repairs,
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.960]   you know they're gonna happen at some point,
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.240]   you don't know when, you don't really know the magnitude.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.960]   So you can set up an automatic deposit
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.840]   from your checking account to go into online savings
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.600]   that for 50 bucks a month to cover a car payment,
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.960]   that car repair payments, you know it's gonna happen.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.080]   I think a lot of it just depends
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.160]   like how psychologically important it is
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.320]   for you to have that one hub
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.600]   versus having a bunch of different accounts
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.960]   and putting them together using something like Mint.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.400]   I just think that the automation thing is key
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.200]   because having to worry about all that
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.640]   and write a check for everything
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.520]   or track down and pay each bill each month,
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.420]   it's gonna be easy to forget and miss some of those.
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.240]   So something that's simple for us is,
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.880]   I mentioned this before, I think my wife had like a $50
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.400]   coming right out of her paycheck to a Disney fund.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.120]   She set it up like three years in advance
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.500]   'cause she knew where we were going.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.440]   I do think the great thing about a 401k or a 403,
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.880]   like a workplace retirement account
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.240]   is that it never hits your account in the first place.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.840]   You never have to see that money hitting your account
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.360]   and then see it go back out.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.120]   I think for some people that like loss aversion
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.320]   type of thing, seeing the money leave is harder.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.900]   So the fact that you never see it, I think that makes sense.
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.440]   But the other thing is I treat savings like a bill payment.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.240]   So if it's the 529 for my kids
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.500]   or for some people it's an HSA or the 401k,
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.000]   I think if you treat that like a bill payment
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.120]   and assume it's just not gonna be there,
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.520]   that helps you figure out your spending
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.800]   on the backend a little easier
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.640]   and you just kind of let that stuff go and don't touch it.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.200]   And as long as it's automatic,
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.000]   it makes it easier to not worry about it.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.040]   And you think, okay, this is a bill
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:01.880]   that's gonna be paid each month.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.480]   I'm not having to worry about it.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.280]   - At what point do you think Disney will allow people
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:10.280]   to pull money out before taxes on their paychecks?
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.920]   - I can't believe they haven't gotten to the point
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.520]   where people are fighting back yet.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.480]   It's still the busiest place on earth.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.920]   And yeah, their inflation has got to be doubled
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.560]   the average for the country, easily.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.240]   - Yeah, seems like it based on animal spirits.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.160]   You guys discussed that.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.360]   - And one more thing, I think once you do automate
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.880]   all this stuff, it probably makes sense
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.620]   to at least check it like once a year
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.120]   because you could have subscriptions you're paying
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.080]   for magazines or gyms or streaming services
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.080]   that you don't use anymore.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.280]   So I think it makes, and for them, that's perfect.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.120]   That's recurring revenue.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.160]   That's what they hope for, right?
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.700]   I have a Planet Fitness gym by me
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.540]   and it's 10 bucks a month.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.600]   And I always think, how in the hell
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.680]   does this business model work?
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.640]   And oh yeah, it works because people sign up for it.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.560]   It's automatically taken from their checking account.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.600]   And then a lot of them just never go.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.020]   And it just takes that out all the time.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.360]   So it makes sense to at least review this stuff,
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.820]   I'd say, on an annual basis.
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.480]   - Cool, good advice.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.720]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.160]   - Okay, question three is, as a single 34-year-old male
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.560]   with about $500,000 in net worth,
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.360]   should I be looking into establishing a living trust?
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.440]   I have no idea what this means,
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.160]   so I'm looking forward to this one.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.040]   I have no kids or wife and no major concerns
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.540]   of passing on my wealth other than the beneficiaries
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.800]   assigned to my accounts.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.880]   If I were to start one, what should I expect to pay
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.220]   for a living trust in California or just in general?
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.900]   - Duncan, Portfolio Rescue is great for you
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.220]   'cause I feel like at least once a week
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.060]   there's a question where you say,
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:31.900]   I don't know what this is.
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.040]   - Yeah, all the time. - Right, it's perfect.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.540]   So I am not a trust expert,
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.180]   but we do have a trust expert on our team here.
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.640]   Let's bring Taylor Hollis in.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.700]   She is one of the newest members
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.940]   of Richardson Wealth Management.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:42.780]   - Hey, Taylor.
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:43.600]   - Hello. - An advisor
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.100]   just came to us from Nashville.
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.860]   Taylor has worked with trust in her career.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.460]   So first of all, before we get into like,
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.540]   does this person really need one, tell us what is a trust?
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.240]   What are some of the reasons that someone would look
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.160]   to have one and what the benefits are?
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.300]   - Yeah, so I think trust a lot of times
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.980]   get kind of a smoke and mirrors reputation.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.360]   So I'll kind of boil it down.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.200]   I think in simplest terms,
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.440]   I like to think of a trust as a box.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.240]   So it's literally just a separate entity
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.940]   that you can put assets in.
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.940]   And sometimes it's its own separate tax reporting entity.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Sometimes it's files back to your own personal tax return.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.760]   In the case of the living trust,
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.760]   they're asking about in the question,
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.160]   that's also known as a revocable trust,
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.360]   which is essentially just an extension of yourself.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.800]   So as long as you are serving as the trustee
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.640]   of your revocable or living trust,
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.420]   then it'll flow through back to your tax return.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.000]   And it's one entity as far as the IRS
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.040]   and the government's concerned.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.520]   - So what is the protection you're looking for
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.460]   by setting up a trust?
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.100]   Like what are you trying to protect your money from?
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.660]   - So talking about a revocable trust,
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.660]   which is what his question is, or a living trust,
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.820]   is kind of different than talking
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.300]   about an irrevocable trust.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.380]   If you're setting up an irrevocable trust,
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.580]   you're typically trying to protect from creditors,
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.380]   potentially future ex-spouses,
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.380]   just future kind of family concerns
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.900]   that might be on the horizon.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.500]   But with a revocable trust that he's asking about,
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.620]   I think the main benefits to setting that up
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.320]   are that when you pass away, you bypass probate.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:28.320]   So probate is the term for the court proceedings
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.420]   that your estate has to go through when you die.
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.480]   So when you pass away, you have all your assets,
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.920]   investment accounts, maybe a house, those kinds of things.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.300]   And it, under normal circumstances,
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.140]   has to go through this probate process through a court.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.460]   And so, but by setting up a revocable or living trust,
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.620]   that is totally bypassed and everything goes
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.240]   according to how you've designated it
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.300]   in the trust document.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.780]   - It's not as messy, right?
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.860]   - Not as messy.
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.780]   Not as messy, not as much of a burden
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.180]   on your family members that are likely settling your estate.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.380]   And another main benefit to setting up a revocable trust
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.560]   is privacy.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.620]   That's something a lot of people like about it.
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.700]   Whether it's if you buy a home
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.380]   and you put it in the name of the trust,
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.700]   not everyone can see that John Smith bought this house.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.340]   It might just be the Smith Living Trust
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.580]   and they don't know exactly who it was.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.500]   It's also, from a privacy standpoint,
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.940]   beneficial for your heirs who's inheriting your assets
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.260]   because maybe you don't want everyone to know
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.980]   that your son or daughter inherited a million dollars
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:37.980]   when you passed away.
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:42.980]   And if your estate goes through probate through a will,
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.180]   that's all public record.
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.340]   So anyone can walk up to the courthouse
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.180]   and look up wills and look up probate proceedings.
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.020]   - So how about this example
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.420]   where we have a 34-year-old single male, no kids.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.740]   'Cause I've heard examples in the past of life insurance
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.140]   and I've had friends who were single at the time
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:57.980]   and they said, "Hey, someone's trying
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.820]   "to get me to buy life insurance."
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.740]   And I said, "You're single, what does it matter?"
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.420]   Does that same apply for a trust
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.200]   or do you think there are cases where this makes sense
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.820]   to just make it easier and pass it along
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.360]   if something should happen to them?
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.500]   - Yeah, I don't think in this particular case
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.620]   it's absolutely necessary.
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.940]   But I do think that if it's something
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.580]   that they're thinking about,
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.380]   setting it up now will only make their life easier
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.420]   in the future.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.900]   So he mentioned he doesn't own any real estate,
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.220]   but when the time comes,
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.820]   if you're planning on purchasing a house,
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.380]   you already have that revocable trust set up
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.540]   and you can just buy the house in the name of the trust
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.800]   instead of having to quit claim the deed later on
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.020]   and so on and so forth.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.460]   So it still gives you full control over your assets,
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.180]   even though you don't have kids,
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.260]   but it still would give you control
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260]   to say who those assets go to
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.780]   if something untimely happened at such a young age.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.940]   So again, I don't think it's absolutely necessary,
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.040]   but you're definitely not going to harm anything
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.660]   by setting it up now and just having it in place for future.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.020]   - Are trusts set up in old English in the 1700s?
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.700]   Because I feel like revocable and irrevocable
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.900]   are words that I would stumble over all the time
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.980]   and I would have a hard time spelling
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.300]   every time I had to do it.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.180]   - Yes, yes.
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.660]   And they sound so much alike
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.580]   that it's easy to misunderstand.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.900]   I think they actually date back to the medieval ages,
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.500]   but that's for a different episode.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.340]   We don't need to go there.
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.420]   - It seems intentionally confusing.
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.260]   - Yes.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.620]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.780]   - Okay.
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.280]   So last but not least, we have,
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.780]   I'd appreciate some insight on donor advised funds or DAFs.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.380]   Considering all of the donations
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.620]   going to a crisis right now,
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.260]   this seems like a good opportunity to go over what they are
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.460]   and the pros and cons.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.060]   I'm looking to donate 50 to 100 bucks a month
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.420]   towards a charity, but first I wanted to learn about DAFs.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.580]   - I think this is the second question
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.160]   we've gotten on this in as many weeks,
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.000]   which is good to see.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.460]   People are trying to get back and figure out ways to do it.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.780]   So first of all, Taylor, we'll go over
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.300]   what is a donor advised fund, when it makes sense,
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.380]   and then what are some of the potential benefits
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.380]   and when it doesn't make sense.
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.820]   - Yeah, so donor advised fund,
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.380]   actually kind of similar to a trust, is a separate entity.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.460]   So it's a charitable giving vehicle
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.480]   that individuals or married couples can set up
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.480]   to fund their charitable intentions out of.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.900]   Some people might be familiar with foundations.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.780]   Those are kind of on a typically a grander scale.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.280]   Donor advised funds, I like to think of
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.800]   as just a simplified foundation.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:33.940]   And I think they really came about in popularity
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.220]   after the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.580]   because that significantly increased
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.620]   the standard deduction amount,
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.420]   and which is good for a lot of folks,
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.420]   but it raised the threshold of charitable donations
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.780]   and their benefit to you from a tax standpoint.
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:57.000]   So donor advised funds became very popular out of that
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.620]   because you have the ability to,
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.940]   what I call bunch donations.
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.020]   So you're essentially pre-funding your charitable giving.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:10.020]   So instead of giving away $10,000 each year
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.560]   because there's not a huge benefit to you
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.820]   from a tax standpoint of that
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.940]   'cause you're still under that standard deduction,
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.940]   but you can instead one year decide to put $50,000,
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.140]   call it, into a donor advised fund,
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.340]   you get a much more significant tax deduction by doing that,
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.260]   and you've essentially pre-funded
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.820]   all your future charitable gifting.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.100]   So then going forward, you can gift charitably
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.120]   out of this donor advised fund.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.820]   - And it seems like these are the type of funds too
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.540]   where people will donate a mutual fund
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.700]   or a stock or something like that, right?
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.540]   Where it's a lot of times
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.860]   you're donating securities into these things.
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.820]   How does that work?
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.660]   - Right, right.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:52.340]   So if you own securities with a very low cost basis,
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.340]   a lot of times there's a kind of double tax advantage
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.700]   to donating that to your donor advised fund
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:03.020]   because A, you get the deduction for the charitable gift,
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.900]   but also you're not having to recognize those gains
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.420]   on your personal return, right?
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.020]   So you're avoiding gains
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.540]   and getting a deduction at the same time.
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.500]   So a lot of times those appreciated securities
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.180]   are a great option to put into the DAF.
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.020]   - What do we think, Duncan?
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.140]   You got it now?
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:19.980]   - I think so.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.820]   I'm seeing a lot of people didn't know what they are,
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.860]   so it makes me feel better that, you know,
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.900]   I just learned about these last week, so.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.860]   - It is one of these things
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.260]   that seems like this secret little thing
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.180]   if you'd ever heard about it,
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.060]   but again, I think it's a great thing.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.460]   People are thinking about more intelligent ways to give,
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.820]   and this seems like one that makes a lot of sense
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.100]   for people, especially if you have some securities
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.580]   that you're willing to donate, right?
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.420]   - Right, right.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.220]   And I like to, it's a good idea to be strategic about it.
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.940]   So if you have a big income year,
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:48.100]   let's say you sell, you know, investment property
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.620]   or you just make a lot of money one year,
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.380]   it's a great option to try to look at funding a DAF
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.660]   in that same year to help offset some of that income
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.340]   from a tax standpoint.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.180]   - And this is like,
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.260]   we talked about with Bill last week, Duncan, right?
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.900]   Like, when does it make sense to have a tax advisor
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.620]   or someone that's looking this stuff over for you
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.700]   when you don't know this stuff and you need real help?
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.540]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.580]   Yeah, this kind of stuff, it seems, yeah, so complicated,
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.140]   pretty hard to do on your own.
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:11.980]   - Right.
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:12.820]   Okay. - Yep.
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.640]   - I think that's all the questions for this week.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.860]   Thanks to Taylor.
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.700]   - Yeah. - Taylor.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.520]   - Thanks for having me. - Thanks, Taylor.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.020]   - Welcome to Riddholtz.
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.660]   You've been here for four weeks now.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.580]   - Four weeks.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:21.700]   - Yep, and already on Portfolio Rescue.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.620]   Good job. - Here we are.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.120]   - Everyone keep those questions and comments coming.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.680]   We have a new "Compound & Friends" tomorrow going up,
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.600]   right, Duncan?
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.000]   - Yes, we have Nick Kolas on.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.320]   - Oh, very good, from Data Trek.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.720]   Yeah, his research is always good.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.320]   We'll have a new "Animal Spirits."
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.040]   We have a new one coming Saturday,
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.040]   discussing some NFTs that Duncan actually helped us create,
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.360]   which are pretty cool.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.880]   And it's also gonna be a charitable component there.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.360]   We'll have a new one Monday and Wednesday as well.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.560]   And then, what are your thoughts on Tuesday?
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.800]   So thanks, everyone, for tuning in.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.820]   As always, send us your questions.
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.560]   Askthecompoundshow@gmail.com,

[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.020]   - Thanks, everyone.
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:59.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.020]   (upbeat music continues)
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.440]   (upbeat music continues)
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.020]   (upbeat music)
