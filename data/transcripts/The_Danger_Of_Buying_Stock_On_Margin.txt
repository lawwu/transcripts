[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.020]   And in this episode,
[00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.460]   I wanna talk about buying stocks on margin,
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.660]   why we shouldn't do so,
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.000]   and why we shouldn't confuse brains with a bull market.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   2021 turned out to be a banner year for stocks,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500]   for real estate, for cryptocurrencies.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.620]   And then 2022 turned out to be a bear market
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.840]   with the S&P 500 down about 20%, giving up all its gains.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.740]   Cryptocurrencies down 60 to 90, 900%.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.240]   And then real estate finally starting to fade
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.720]   in the second half of 2022.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.400]   So obviously losing money from anything stinks,
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.700]   but it's just part of the risk we take
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.280]   when we put our money to work in risk assets.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.640]   If we invest a long enough period of time,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.820]   we will lose money.
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.200]   And sometimes we will lose a lot of money.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.520]   The key is to learn from every single loss
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.240]   so you can better calibrate your risk exposure.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.960]   Now the proper asset allocation is where you make money
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.400]   and you don't feel much emotion.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.640]   And when you lose the money,
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.000]   you don't feel much emotion either.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.640]   This is really important to be a long-term investor,
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.280]   a successful long-term investor.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.080]   You don't wanna get your emotions to whipsaw you,
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.160]   to panic sell at the bottom and then panic buy at the top
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.200]   because you're suffering from intense investing FOMO.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.520]   I have mentioned in the past that investing FOMO
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.680]   is very, very hard to break.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.600]   It's I think harder than the lifestyle FOMO
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600]   you see on social media, Instagram and so forth.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.040]   That stuff, you can go visit Bali,
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.800]   you can go visit the pyramids of Egypt eventually,
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.560]   but investing FOMO is like, wow,
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.200]   that person's getting rich, I need to get rich too.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.820]   And I can just click some buttons to get there
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.300]   without doing the proper due diligence, research
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.080]   and understanding of your true risk tolerance.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.120]   Now in the past,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.080]   I've talked about quantifying your risk tolerance
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.600]   by looking at how much time you can buy
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.340]   with your investment gains
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.720]   and how much time you will lose with your investment losses.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.580]   So if you always think about money in terms of time,
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.280]   I think it helps better calibrate
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.320]   how much risk you should actually take.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.760]   It makes you really focus on risk management
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.880]   every single quarter, every six months, every single year
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.800]   to make sure you have a proper asset allocation.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.760]   There are really two ways to get ahead
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.980]   when it comes to money.
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.720]   One is to make more money and have greater returns
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.600]   than everybody else, or at least the average.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.920]   And the other way during a bear market
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.500]   is to lose less than everybody else.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.840]   Because at the end of the day, finance is relative.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.120]   So if everybody's down 50% and you're only down 10%,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.400]   yeah, losing 10% will still sting,
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.240]   but you are relatively better by that 40% differential.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.640]   So even though you might've lost money in 2022,
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.600]   which I did, which I think most of you have,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.640]   feel better knowing that we significantly outperform
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.920]   those who let emotions control the way they invest.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.900]   You know, they invested too much in cryptocurrencies,
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.520]   too much in real estate, way too much leverage,
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.240]   and then they bought stocks on margin.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.560]   So I've written in the past,
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.900]   buying stocks on margin is not a good idea
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.440]   because stocks, as we saw in 2022,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.660]   can disappear in value overnight.
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.240]   You know, you miss earnings by 3%,
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.320]   the stock goes down 20%,
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.240]   and it can just continue to go down.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.600]   The values are almost not real.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.780]   The only way you can realize the value,
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.400]   the gains of stocks is by selling.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.240]   Selling on occasion, over time,
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.000]   and then converting that funny money into real assets
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.600]   or converting that money into enjoyment experiences.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.160]   There's a reason why bond companies
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.080]   don't accept stocks usually as collateral.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.880]   And there's a reason why lenders,
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.480]   banks specifically,
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.560]   don't accept stocks for collateral either.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.180]   They want hard assets, real assets,
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.400]   that they have higher confidence in converting
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.120]   into some value in case we, you default on a loan.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.240]   So if large institutions
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.560]   are only accepting real assets as collateral,
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.280]   this is a lesson to be learned for all of us.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.760]   The lesson is non-real asset investments
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.880]   are highly volatile.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.480]   They're more volatile and there's just more risk.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.400]   So if you decide to buy stocks on margin,
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.520]   I think it's kind of like playing with a live grenade
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.000]   while walking through a minefield.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.020]   Eventually you're gonna blow yourself up
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.440]   and you could blow yourself up real quick, right?
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.040]   There's a saying, stocks go up like a, what?
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.960]   An escalator and goes down like an elevator.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.680]   And so if it goes down like an elevator
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.780]   while you're on margin, you could lose all your money.
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.600]   From 2019 to early 2022,
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.580]   I played weekend softball all the times.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.120]   Just meet up, casual games from 10.30 a.m.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.000]   on a Saturday till 2.30 p.m.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.400]   It was pretty fun in general.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.680]   However, the organizer would chide me
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.200]   and ride me all the time for not running through first base,
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.880]   not diving for balls, not going all out.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.120]   And I told him, look buddy, I've got two young kids.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.760]   I can't afford to sprain my knee, sprain my ankle,
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.560]   get pegged in the face.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.480]   If that happened, I wouldn't be able
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.200]   to do other physical activities.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   Most importantly, playing with my children
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.040]   who are still so small and who have so much energy
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.400]   and wanna play with me all the time.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.680]   But he didn't care.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.960]   Every single Saturday, he would make fun of my effort.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.600]   And then if I was on some team, he'd say,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.800]   oh, well, good luck.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.360]   Sam is on your team, good luck.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.560]   But regardless of this chiding,
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.800]   it was interesting to talk to him about Tesla stock
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.700]   because he fashioned himself as an investing guru,
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.680]   even though he was a preschool teacher.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.360]   And I gotta say, as someone who spent his career in finance,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.320]   who got his MBA, I love listening to people
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.160]   who don't know about finance, talk about finance.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.560]   It's actually really entertaining to me,
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.200]   talking about, they talk about the technical analysis
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.480]   because they don't understand fundamental analysis
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.680]   of a company.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.360]   They talk about how things are gonna go to the moon.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.720]   2021 was a really highlight period.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.640]   So I heard him talk a lot about his new Tesla car
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.840]   and how he bought Tesla stock in 2018, 2019,
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.640]   and he's making so much money.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.880]   And he's the type of person who really needs
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.480]   to tell the world how much money he has.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.920]   And maybe it's because he's a preschool teacher
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.400]   and preschool teachers don't make that much money,
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.560]   but they make a decent amount of money.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.520]   It's about 70,000, he said, here in San Francisco.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.600]   And so every week I would hear him tell me
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   how much money he made in Tesla stock.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.600]   And then one weekend he said,
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.640]   I bought even more stock 'cause there was like a dip.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.600]   I bought more stock.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.000]   And I was thinking to myself,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.600]   man, how much Tesla stock do you have?
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.660]   How much in one position, folks?
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.600]   And I thought it was around $250,000 in Tesla stock,
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.640]   just assuming that he made money
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.360]   and just back of the envelope calculations.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.040]   And then he revealed to me he had over a thousand shares,
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.120]   which at that point meant he had
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.480]   over a $900,000 position in Tesla stock.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.560]   And I was thinking to myself, why not?
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.720]   This is like never,
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.920]   you're like the richest preschool teacher I've ever met.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.040]   How do you get that money?
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.760]   And he didn't admit it,
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.200]   but he did say he was buying stock on margin
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.980]   and the margin rates are only about 5% at the time.
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.760]   And immediately I told him,
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.580]   look, dude, that is a massive position.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.420]   We're in stock market mania right now.
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.460]   And if you lose money through margin,
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.880]   you could lose a lot of money.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.980]   And he just didn't have it.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.140]   He just said, ah, why am I gonna listen to you?
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.260]   You don't even run through the bases.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.500]   Okay, so fine.
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.420]   Well, as we know, a year and a half later,
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.080]   Tesla stock is down 65, 70%.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.480]   Elon Musk has lost $200 billion in one year in 2022.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.120]   So that's a record.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.000]   And so what happened?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.200]   Well, I didn't ask him what happened
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.240]   because that's pretty rude.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.840]   And I'm not gonna just kick a man when he's down,
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.480]   but I can guess what happened.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.480]   And basically he probably lost up to $630,000.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.680]   Now, can you imagine losing $630,000?
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.920]   I mean, if you had a $10 million portfolio,
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.600]   okay, fine, $630,000, it's just what it is, right?
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.080]   It's 6.3%.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.440]   But in his case, with his income, 70,000,
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.160]   let's say it's even 100,000.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.880]   First of all, it's gonna take over 10 years
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.840]   for him to make up for his losses, right?
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.320]   This is using the FSC or methodology
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.420]   in terms of how many months or how many years
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.020]   it will take based on your average income
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.840]   to make up for your losses.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.380]   Now, if you are willing to spend over three years,
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.160]   actually in the post I said over 18 months
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.480]   to make up for your losses,
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.520]   I say you have a high risk tolerance.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.520]   Now, if you got the gumption to risk 10 years of your life
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.400]   to make up for potential losses,
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.840]   then your risk tolerance is out the window.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.760]   It's massively extreme.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.040]   But here's the thing.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.040]   Maybe losing all your money buying stocks on margin
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.800]   is not the worst thing.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.060]   Because I was thinking about Ford.
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.600]   So any self-respecting person who makes a mistake
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.840]   will be willing to work hard to rectify the mistake.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.920]   So in his case, at least 10 years
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.860]   to make up for his losses of one year.
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.600]   But what I didn't realize was that
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.440]   he probably lost his entire net worth,
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.120]   which means that at age 39,
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.160]   his net worth is equivalent to when he was 22
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.600]   right out of college.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.040]   Think about that, folks.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.040]   Losing 17 years of savings and investments in one year.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.460]   So you've got to make up for the time in the backend
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.840]   by working more.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.380]   And then you just wiped away all that hard work,
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.200]   time and savings in the front end.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   So psychologically, I don't know what that does to someone,
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.880]   losing all that progress
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.520]   and then having to make up for it in the future.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.160]   It's obviously not good.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.100]   So the next time you wanna buy something on margin
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.120]   or just buy any investment,
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.300]   think about very clearly
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.860]   how much you have to sacrifice in the future
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.420]   and how much of your progress you have to give up as well.
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.860]   But guess what, folks?
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.980]   Losing all that time in the future
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.820]   and all that progress from the past
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.860]   might not be the worst thing, buying stocks on margin.
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.300]   The worst thing could be losing your reputation,
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.180]   your pride, your honor.
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.440]   In my softball acquaintances case,
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.840]   every week he would post on Facebook
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.920]   his analysis on Tesla stock and why it should be a buy
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.520]   and why it's going up, quarterly results
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.800]   and how much money he made.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.220]   I mean, it was a very loud megaphone of bragging
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.440]   about how well he was doing.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.560]   And then when the stock started declining,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.360]   he would hold on and he's been quiet for over six months
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.000]   about his Tesla position.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.040]   And that's what happens.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.040]   When we're making a lot of money, we get very emotional.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.720]   And some people with outsized exposure
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.400]   then start bragging about how much they make.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.240]   And this is very dangerous
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.560]   because you could end up losing money.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.720]   And when that happens, you're gonna look like a fool
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.600]   if you've been bragging so much to the public
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.060]   about how much you were making.
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.040]   So the key here is to stay humble
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.400]   when you're making a lot of money
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.060]   and bank those returns
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:45.080]   to buffer inevitable downside losses.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.640]   You wanna be making a lot of money quietly
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.680]   and you wanna be losing a lot of money quietly.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.080]   It works both ways.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.680]   Think about how much money
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.800]   and how much effort companies spend
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.720]   on getting their reputations right.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.640]   Employee training, culture training, motto training,
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.680]   saying your company right, all this stuff.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.280]   Because reputations take years to build
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.200]   and it can take minutes, minutes to destroy.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.400]   And if you don't have your reputation, you have nothing.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.680]   Nobody is gonna give Elizabeth Holmes
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.460]   and Sam Bankman Freed more money to invest.
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.520]   Their reputations are done.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.060]   It's gone to zero.
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.280]   But worse, what's worse I think
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.540]   is the harm that they've done to their parents.
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.060]   This is just worse from their point of view.
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.040]   The harm they've done to their parents' reputations.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.200]   You know, Sam is dragging down his parents
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.120]   who spent decades as professors at Stanford University.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.840]   They were esteemed professors, they were respected.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.760]   Now, you know, they've canceled their classes.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.080]   I think people are gonna look at them with suspicion,
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.040]   wondering how much did they advise Sam
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.880]   to set up this Ponzi scheme and do illegal things.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.980]   So to the extreme,
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.780]   we can talk about multi-generational reputation destruction
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.280]   and what happens to the kids of these folks.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.760]   You know, I'm talking about extremes here,
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.440]   but you know, the kids, the innocent kids
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.400]   who have nothing to do with the sins
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.120]   of their mothers and fathers,
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.300]   they might be unfairly hurt as well.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.360]   So think about that.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.600]   Think about that next time you wanna buy stocks
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   and other funny money investments on margin.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.120]   In my softball acquaintances' case,
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.320]   look, you can't buy hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.640]   in one stock on a $70,000 salary.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.160]   And you can't do that with margin.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.600]   There's basically a limit on how much margin you can buy,
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.440]   which is basically 50% of the total value of your position.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.200]   So how does someone making $70,000 to $100,000
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.680]   buy $400,000 of stock
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.640]   and then borrows another $400,000, let's say?
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.000]   Well, as an immigrant,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.440]   he probably borrowed money from his parents
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.960]   'cause this is what immigrant families do.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.600]   They think about the collective.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.880]   My money is your money, parents' money is my money.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.200]   And as a collective,
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.160]   because they're immigrants with not a lot of money,
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.980]   they're trying to pull together their resources
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.480]   to get ahead for multi-generations.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.800]   So if you end up buying stocks on margin
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.080]   and borrowing money from your parents
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.600]   who came to this country with nothing
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.400]   and then lose hundreds of thousands of dollars of it
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.920]   or all of it,
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.360]   you are gonna be in a world of hurt mentally
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.800]   and you're gonna lose that honor your parents have for you,
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.200]   at least temporarily.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.320]   So once again,
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.880]   this is the danger of falling for investing FOMO.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.960]   This is the danger of taking on debt
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.720]   to buy assets that have no guaranteed returns.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.040]   You could lose money in those assets
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.520]   and you will end up paying a margin expense.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.000]   Now, there is a silver lining to this story.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.960]   Due to margin calls,
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.840]   my softball acquaintance likely didn't lose $630,000
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.080]   or 70% of his entire position
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.920]   because the online brokerage would have margin called him
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.320]   to force him to put up capital
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.600]   or sell stocks on the way down.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.280]   Usually it starts at around down 25%.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.120]   So instead of losing 630,000,
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.640]   he might've only lost 350,000.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.000]   Whatever the case may be,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.280]   a $350,000 loss on a 70,000 to $100,000 income
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.320]   is still a lot
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.680]   and it's just the same story to be careful
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.320]   when you're buying risk assets.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.160]   All right, everybody,
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.520]   I hope this story demonstrates the danger
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.520]   of buying stocks on margin.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:45.000]   And I know, look, it's easy to think we're geniuses
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.120]   when times are really good
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.240]   and we're making money hand over fist in our stocks,
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.400]   real estate, or whatever asset class it is.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.360]   Just know, bad things happen all the time.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.840]   I've talked about this since I started
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.960]   Financial Samurai in 2009
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.480]   and we need to stay even keeled,
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.200]   humble and measured during good times and during bad times.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.880]   Please, if you listen to an episode
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.160]   or read a post on Financial Samurai
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.120]   where I'm bragging and I'm not being measured,
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.240]   balancing the good with the bad, please let me know.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.040]   Please hit me upside the head
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.560]   and remind me about the importance of humility.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.000]   Thanks so much everyone for listening.
