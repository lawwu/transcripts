[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   The Bing app, now available on Android and iOS, is about efficiency over extravagance.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.840]   It's on your phone, so it's not about essay writing, compiling code, or making funny poems
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.580]   in French.
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.300]   It's about taking search to the next level.
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.340]   No, I'm not sponsored by them, but I think it's mind-blowing.
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.660]   There are four levels of search, increasing in power and requisite intelligence, and Google
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.400]   is pretty much only able to do level one, and even then, not always.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.880]   Bing can do all four.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.700]   Let me show you in this video exactly what I mean, taking you through all four levels
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.260]   of search.
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.260]   By the end, I honestly think I'm going to persuade you that smartphones just got upgraded
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.100]   permanently.
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.200]   Just quickly, how does it look on mobile?
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.220]   Well, if you open up the app, you will see at the bottom a Bing button.
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.680]   On any webpage, just like you can in the Edge browser, you can press on the Bing button
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.060]   and open up Bing chat.
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.440]   You then have two options.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.080]   You can ask it questions via the microphone or via the keyboard.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.780]   For example, you could ask,
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.340]   "Who is currently seventh in the Premier League?"
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.740]   Searching for Premier League table.
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.540]   According to the Premier League table, Brighton and Hove Albion is currently seventh in the
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.780]   league with 35 points from 22 games played.
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.980]   They have scored 39 goals and conceded 29 goals, giving them a goal difference of 10.
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.280]   That's another fascinating difference with Bing on mobile.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.820]   It actually speaks to you.
[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.240]   I wouldn't call it cutting edge text-to-voice, but we're just getting started.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.300]   You're probably wondering, "How does this transform?"
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.300]   Search.
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.300]   How does this upgrade our smartphones?
[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.880]   Well, this is just a level one search.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.640]   We are retrieving one bit of information.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.080]   And even on this front, Bing does better than Google.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.160]   The exact same question into Google gives a generalized formula about the Premier League
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.040]   and what seventh place means.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.920]   Bing understands exactly what I want and gives the correct answer.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.500]   But I will admit, if we were just comparing level one searches, Bing wouldn't be that
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.500]   much of an upgrade.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.820]   You could always click on a link to a table and see for yourself.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.960]   Maybe you're saving a few seconds with Bing, but not really a big difference.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.820]   But just wait until we get to level three and even level four and beyond searches.
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.880]   And now you guys are ready for level two searches.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.320]   And what do I mean by that?
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.640]   This time we are retrieving two bits of disparate data, but we want to do it at the same time,
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.540]   not doing two separate searches.
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.580]   By the way, I'm typing these searches into Bing desktop so you can see them more clearly.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.340]   But of course, it would be even quicker to ask them with my voice.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.460]   I asked, what are the ages of the Eiffel Tower and the Empire State Building?
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.460]   And look at the difference.
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.720]   I can clearly see the two results on the left in Bing, but on the right, I'm going to have
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.040]   to click on at least two links and scroll through the data.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.720]   You can just begin to imagine the number of searches this could apply to.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.360]   And we're only on level two.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.360]   The next example of a level two search would be to retrieve a bit of information and do
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.360]   something to it.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.460]   For example, I asked both Bing and Google.
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.460]   Bing is the only search that's going to be able to do something to it.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.340]   Bing is the only search that's going to be able to do something to it.
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.400]   So if Microsoft's market cap doubled, what would it be?
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.580]   There are two stages to that question.
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.820]   First it has to retrieve Microsoft's current market cap, then it has to double it.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.820]   Bing gets the answer.
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.820]   Google doesn't even show the market cap, not immediately at least.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.520]   Even here, I know some of you will be thinking, oh, I could just type in market cap, find
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   the source, get out a calculator and double it.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.520]   What's the big problem?
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.220]   Yes, maybe you save 30 seconds, but what's the big deal?
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.500]   Well, we haven't even gotten to level three or level four searches yet.
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.600]   So what is an example of a level three search?
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.340]   Imagine you're on your smartphone and you're considering the Adobe Creative Cloud.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.700]   And imagine you wanted to know just how much more expensive it would be over, say, a couple
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.520]   year time period than DaVinci Resolve.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.060]   You could press the Bing button and ask this.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.020]   According to this page, if I got the individual account for two years, how much more expensive
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.940]   would that be in pounds than the one-off payment for DaVinci Resolve 18?
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.660]   Now as I've talked about in my other Bing chat playlist videos.
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.040]   It understands the context in which you're asking the question.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.800]   It knows you mean this Adobe Creative Cloud individual plan.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.900]   It correctly multiplies this for two years and then compares the total to DaVinci Resolve's
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.900]   price.
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.320]   Now, initially I thought it made a mistake because when I quickly checked on Google,
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.660]   DaVinci Resolve costs £255.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.240]   But then when I clicked to buy it, it adds on VAT, which makes it £306 in the UK.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.760]   So in a way, that's another win for Bing.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.000]   It understood about adding on VAT.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.900]   But what makes this a level three search is it did all of that work.
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.500]   It retrieved the two bits of information in context and then compared them, then subtracted
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.360]   them, giving us a difference of £941 in the price over two years.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.360]   And of course, you could carry on this conversation with Bing about the pros and cons of each
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.360]   package.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.140]   For some of these searches, I am not even going to try it in Google because it would
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.440]   completely flop.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.200]   Level three searches are about much more than this though.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.940]   Imagine you're standing on the Euston Road.
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.260]   And you want to get to central London.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.560]   You could conduct a level three search using Bing.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.620]   The question might be how much longer would it take to get the Underground from Kings
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.480]   Cross to Piccadilly Circus than from Euston to Oxford Circus?
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.240]   Or how much longer would it take to go from Kings Cross to Hyde Park Corner than from
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.020]   Euston to Victoria?
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.380]   These are all journeys that I make on a regular basis and I can confirm that the results are
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.540]   accurate.
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.540]   Why is this level three?
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.420]   Because it had to retrieve the information about one journey.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.200]   Then the other.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.480]   And then make the comparison.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.240]   But are level three searches all about addition and subtraction?
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.240]   No.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.240]   Check this out.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.340]   You could ask how much bigger are polar bears than brown bears and why?
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.480]   Google would have to do three things and it just isn't up to it.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.920]   You'd have to find the size of the average polar bear, the size of the average brown
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.340]   bear and then do an analysis of why polar bears are bigger.
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.940]   Not just a mathematical comparison but an understanding, a comprehension.
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.020]   And then you'd have to find the size of the average polar bear.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.680]   An explanation of the why's.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.860]   Think of level three as adding a when, where, why and how to level two searches.
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.160]   The answer, by the way, is quite interesting.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.640]   So polar bears can weigh up to 1700 pounds versus 1320 pounds.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.420]   But we didn't just want to know that.
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.940]   We wanted to know the reason why.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.100]   And apparently the reason why is, and I can believe this, is that they need more body
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.840]   mass and fat to survive in the cold Arctic environment.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.840]   They also have a bigger skull.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.840]   They have a bigger body.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.320]   They have bigger skull and larger teeth to hunt seals.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.400]   So now I've got more of an idea not just how much bigger they are, but why it is through
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.520]   evolution that they ended up being bigger.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.600]   But we have waited long enough.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.260]   What about level four searches?
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.120]   Well, think about a complex, interesting search like this.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:45.240]   How much older is Stonehenge than the Colosseum in Rome expressed in human lifetimes?
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.160]   Bing has to do four things.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.660]   Find the age of Stonehenge, the age of the Colosseum, the difference between them, divided
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.420]   by the average human lifetime.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.900]   It does this successfully and we have a really interesting result.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:05.220]   That it's about 38 human lifetimes older if we take the older date for Stonehenge.
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.900]   That is an insane level of intelligence for a single search.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.900]   Now we're genuinely talking about saving a minute or more compared to using Google.
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.380]   That is a big enough difference to really matter.
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.400]   And that's not the only example I could give you of a level four search.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.780]   I'm sure you could tell me hundreds of ideas in the comments.
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.480]   But try this.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.980]   Going back to the Premier League, I could ask: If Arsenal beat Leicester and Man City
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.480]   draw Bournemouth, how many points ahead would Arsenal be?
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.480]   I didn't have to specify Premier League, I didn't have to say fixture, and of course
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.140]   I didn't have to tell it the rules of the Premier League about three points for a win,
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.140]   etc.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:45.340]   It knew exactly what I was asking, calculated the two results, found the league positions,
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.120]   and then found the difference.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.300]   Now you don't have to be into sport to know that that's an amazing answer to a complex
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.360]   query.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.860]   Think about how this applies to your domain, your career, your interests, and come up with
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.620]   some level four searches that you could ask.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.040]   Which brings me on to my final point.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:09.380]   The question for every smartphone user will be: Is the small but real risk of hallucinations
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:15.300]   more meaningful to me than the additional seconds and minutes required to perform multiple
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.300]   searches?
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.800]   For me, the answer is already yes.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.120]   But clearly what we decide will depend on the topic, right?
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.640]   It's fine for a life-changing house decision, but not for this one.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.500]   By the way, with those new modes that Bing is debuting this week that I'm going to do
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.700]   a video on, where you can pick "Precision over Creativity", soon you might not even
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.400]   need to make a choice between hallucination versus efficiency.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.680]   Very much looking forward to doing a deep dive into those modes by the way.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:48.060]   And yes, what you may find is that Bing when you do voice recognition makes the occasional
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.780]   mistake in what you're asking it.
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.940]   That certainly happened to me.
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.320]   I'm not saying that I'm not going to do it.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.320]   I'm just saying that I'm not going to do it.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.320]   I'm just saying that I'm not going to do it.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.320]   I'm just saying that I'm not going to do it.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.320]   I'm just saying that I'm not going to do it.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.320]   I'm just saying that I'm not going to do it.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.320]   I'm just saying that I'm not going to do it.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.320]   I'm just saying that I'm not going to do it.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.320]   I'm just saying that I'm not going to do it.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   I'm just saying that I'm not going to do it.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.320]   I'm just saying that I'm not going to do it.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.320]   I'm just saying that I'm not going to do it.
