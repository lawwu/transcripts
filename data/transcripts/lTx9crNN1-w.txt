[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   [Music]
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.500]   Heather, a podcast listener, writes in to ask this.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.500]   "Pastor John, I know there have been episodes about God ordaining evil."
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.500]   Yes, episodes 104 and 204.
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.500]   "And also one about whether God heals all of our diseases."
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.500]   Episode 254.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500]   "But what I would like to know is this.
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.500]   Does God ordain all sickness, as in, does God cause all sicknesses to happen?"
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.500]   Before I give a yes or a no, I need to make something clear that may not be clear in Heather's mind.
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.500]   I don't know, maybe it is.
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.500]   But it's hugely important, and so I need to say it before I give the answer.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:56.500]   In any answer, yes or no, we need to take into account that God's causing, God's causation, is not simple.
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:08.500]   That is, it happens with multiple levels of secondary causes in between him or his direct causing and the effect.
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.500]   I'll give four examples.
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500]   I think I can think of four.
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.500]   One, he can cause directly with virtually no intervening causes.
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.500]   And the clearest example of that, of course, would be creation.
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.500]   He's created out of nothing.
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.500]   He didn't use anything to create.
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.500]   Nothing came between his word and the thing that came into being.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.500]   Number two, he can use physical means where the direct intervention is further back in the chain.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:52.500]   For example, Acts 12, 23, "Since Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down,
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.500]   and he was eaten by worms and died."
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.500]   So you've got between God and Herod, and this is clearly a punishment from God for not giving God glory.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.500]   But you've got two agents, angels and worms.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.500]   And so who caused the death?
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   Answer, worms.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.500]   Who caused the death?
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500]   Answer, an angel.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.500]   Who caused the death?
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500]   Answer, God.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.500]   So there's an intervening of angelic or spiritual or physical secondary causes.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   Here's a third example.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   God never lets Satan out of his control and often uses him to accomplish his purposes.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.500]   This was true for Job, where Satan had to get permission to go hammer Job.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   And then Job said it was the Lord that took away.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:58.500]   And the writer says he didn't sin with his lips, even though Satan was more immediately involved in the wind that blew down the house that killed the kids.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   And in 2 Corinthians 12, 7, it says, "To keep me," this is Paul, "to keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations,
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:18.500]   there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me."
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   But what was the purpose of the thorn?
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.500]   "To keep me from becoming too conceited."
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.500]   Really? Satan wants you not to be conceited?
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.500]   No, no, no, no.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.500]   God wants him not to be conceited.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:44.500]   And Satan happens to be the instrument that God is using in this thorn to keep Paul from sinning.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   I'm sure Satan did not appreciate that use because that's exactly the opposite of what Satan designs in the thorn.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.500]   If you get a thorn, Satan is designing your sin, God is designing your sanctification.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.500]   So Satan is one of God's instruments in causality.
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:15.500]   And the last one, number four, God can control sinful people so that they are the immediate cause of whatever.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.500]   This was the case with the crucifixion of Jesus.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:30.500]   Herod Pontius Pilate says, Acts 4, 27, "They were all gathered together to do what your power and will had decided to take place."
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.500]   So all of these secondary causes are significant.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:47.500]   The fact that God is the ultimate or the decisive cause does not make them, these secondary causes, insignificant.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:58.500]   For example, the fact that nicotine causes lung cancer means we can fight cancer by not smoking.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.500]   Or take the human instrument.
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.500]   Some dad may set a terrible example for his kid in smoking.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.500]   Or some friend has a terrible influence on you and mocks you because you're not smoking.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.500]   And so because of his influence you smoke.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   So now you've got nicotine and you've got a dad or you've got an influential friend.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:30.500]   And you can fight cancer by not smoking the nicotine and not hanging out with that friend.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.500]   And if you do those two things, you're not fighting God.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.500]   Even though God is the one who will finally control whether you get cancer or not.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:46.500]   So to say that there are secondary causes is very significant because we can fight those causes.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:06:05.500]   I think it's totally right for millions of dollars to be invested in looking for a cure for HIV/AIDS or cancer or malaria or polio or leukemia or anything like that
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.500]   because those are immediate, there are immediate physical causes probably behind each of those.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.500]   And to fight those secondary causes does not mean we're fighting God.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   God can override or submit to that and he would not be jeopardized in his sovereignty at all.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.500]   So my answer to Heather's question is yes.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:34.500]   Ultimately God does, to use her words, cause all sickness to happen.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.500]   But it might be a very distant cause or it might be a more immediate cause.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.500]   And those intervening causes are all relevant.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.500]   Yes, thank you Pastor John and thank you for listening to this podcast and thank you for the very good question Heather.
