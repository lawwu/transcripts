[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.640]   And now we come to the Lord's table when we personalize all that worship, and we from
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:24.600]   the heart honor the Lord with our repentance, confession, faith and trust, and obedience
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.960]   as we partake.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.740]   But before we do that, I want to take a look at the cross, maybe from a different perspective.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:41.200]   So if you want to look in your Bible, it's 1 Peter, chapter 2, 1 Peter, chapter 2.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:50.200]   And I'll just make a few remarks with regard to this passage.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.620]   First Peter, chapter 2, of course, 1 Peter is written to believers who are scattered
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.840]   in a hostile world.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:05.080]   And they are, in the very outset of this epistle, identified as aliens in the world.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.080]   They're suffering insults and persecution.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.940]   And Peter writes this to encourage them.
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:22.040]   In chapter 2, we'll look at verse 20: "What credit is there if when you sin and are harshly
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.720]   treated you endure it with patience?
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:36.400]   If when you do what is right and suffer for it, you patiently endure it, this finds grace
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.100]   with God.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.560]   For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.820]   you an example for you to follow in His steps, who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.600]   in His mouth.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.380]   And while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.520]   threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.360]   And He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.100]   live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed."
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.480]   Marvelous portion of Scripture.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.380]   One that is one of my very favorites.
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.660]   Of course, verse 24 is the central truth of the gospel, that He bore our sins in His body
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.260]   on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.380]   you were healed.
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.600]   That is the central truth of the gospel, the substitutionary, vicarious, atoning death
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.360]   of Christ, by which our sins were imputed to Him.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.860]   And in return, by faith in Him, His righteousness is imputed to us.
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.600]   We have been singing about that all evening.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.760]   We acknowledge Christ as our Savior, our Redeemer, the sacrifice for sin, the Lamb of God, providing
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.660]   in His death redemption, ransom, deliverance, justification, adoption for all who believe.
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.240]   Through His death, the one sacrificial death that satisfied divinity.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.960]   Through His divine justice, the once-for-all death of Christ that provided eternal salvation
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.740]   to all who believe and confess Jesus as Lord and Savior.
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.940]   But there's something more in the death of Christ beyond the substitutionary atonement
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.980]   that He provided, which, of course, is the most monumental of all features in His death.
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.120]   But there is something more.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.700]   You might say, "Well, is that even possible?"
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.600]   The answer is yes.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.260]   Look at verse 21: "For you have been called for this purpose" - what purpose?
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:18.780]   " - to suffer for doing right," as in verse 20, "to suffer patiently with endurance, and
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.500]   thereby in such enduring righteous suffering find grace with God."
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.000]   You've been called to suffer.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:36.180]   "In this world, since Christ also suffered for you, you have the privilege of now suffering
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.180]   for Him.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.300]   As Paul said, "I bear in my body the marks of Christ."
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.760]   You suffer for His name's sake."
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:55.760]   In His dying, verse 21, He left you an example for you to follow in His steps in your suffering.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:03.300]   It is right, of course, to look at the cross as the vicarious substitutionary atoning death
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:11.380]   of Christ, the once-for-all death for sin in which He purchased redemption for all who
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.880]   would believe through all of human history.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:25.520]   We understand the cross to be the very validation of God's salvation plan.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.700]   But we're told here that there was something else going on on the cross.
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:42.040]   Jesus who suffered for us was leaving us an example for how we should suffer.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.640]   Obviously we can't suffer for our own sins, so this is not some kind of vicarious suffering
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:55.280]   which purchases redemption for us or anyone else.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.340]   Since we are in the world suffering for Christ's sake, suffering for righteousness, patiently
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:11.960]   enduring it, which finds grace with God, we need to know how to deal with that suffering.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.680]   And for that, we look to Him as our example.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.760]   He is the example.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.040]   Since we have been called to suffer for His name.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:31.280]   We need Him as our example.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:38.200]   He not only saves His people by His death on the cross, but He became on the cross the
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:48.780]   perfect example of suffering righteously and suffering unjustly with the right response.
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.800]   The one, 1 John 2:6, who says He abides in Him ought to walk as He walked.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.660]   So if you belong to Christ, you not only know Him as your Savior, but you follow Him as
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.660]   your example.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:11.300]   In His dying, we could say it this way, He is the perfect example of how to live.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.680]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:22.560]   And the apostle Paul said, "Follow Me as I follow Christ."
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   Peter's not talking here about his living.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.720]   Yes, we follow Him in his living.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.220]   We endeavor to walk as He walked.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:42.160]   Peter is saying in his dying, he is an example, a hupagramon , a copy, something you
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:54.320]   set down and trace over to make as exact a replica as possible.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:01.600]   He gave us a pattern for how to face unjust suffering.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:08.780]   In his dying, he gave us a pattern for living in a hostile world.
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:19.700]   He taught us how to face injustice, rejection, persecution.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.140]   He is the sinless example.
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.080]   In verse 22, "He is the perfect example of how to live."
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.080]   He said, "After all, follow Me."
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:09.640]   But in His suffering, which from a human standpoint was unjust, undeserved, He was
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:15.820]   reviled and scorned and blasphemed and mocked and spit on and beaten and whipped and you
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.000]   know the rest.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.020]   And in all of that, He is an example for us of how to handle suffering because He never
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.580]   committed a sin.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:30.080]   A sin like questioning God, doubting God.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.100]   Debating with God.
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.540]   Nor was there any deceit found in His mouth.
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:43.780]   Nothing came out of His mouth that indicated an evil heart.
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.660]   He never did anything unholy.
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:58.960]   He never said anything unholy, even in the worst possible conditions.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.080]   And He became our example.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:07.980]   So that when we are persecuted for righteousness' sake, we follow Him.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.420]   We do nothing sinful.
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.220]   We say nothing sinful.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:23.940]   Verse 23 says, "And while being reviled, He did not revile in return."
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.880]   The word "revile" means to abuse.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.080]   Vile speech.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.860]   Cast at someone.
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.520]   It's a present passive participle, which means it was happening over and over and over and
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.380]   over and over and over.
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.300]   And while being reviled, He did not revile in return.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:11:00.080]   And while suffering in this reviling circumstance, He uttered no threats.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.300]   He didn't strike back.
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.180]   And again, the verb is a verb of continuous action.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.520]   It came at Him over and over and over and over.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.820]   You know the story.
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.360]   We read you a portion of it.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:19.560]   He was mistreated long before that and frequently through His life and ministry.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.980]   And in His trial and all the events leading up to the final crucifixion, He was abused
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.520]   and maligned.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.220]   He never retaliated.
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.080]   Never gave abuse.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.300]   Never gave threats for abuse.
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:42.780]   Never gave threats for threats given to Him.
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.780]   That's the negative.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:48.720]   The positive is at the end of verse 23, "But kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.140]   righteously."
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:58.460]   The hardest thing for us in life, I think, is to endure unjust suffering.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.080]   Back at the beginning of verse 20.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:07.400]   We're told by Peter that - and it's obvious - if you sin and are harshly treated, you
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.600]   endure it with patience, you don't get any credit for that.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.480]   You deserve that.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.700]   We know when we're guilty, and we know when what's happening to us is the chastening of
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.880]   the Lord.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:30.080]   But when we are suffering for righteousness, there's a tendency to want to fight back.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.800]   But Jesus becomes our example.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.360]   He just kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:47.060]   The verb means to turn Himself over, deliver Himself, give over, hand over, commit.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.060]   Why did He do that?
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.840]   Why did He not retaliate?
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:57.160]   Well, for one, He knew that God was His protector; and for two, He knew that vengeance belonged
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.080]   to the Lord, right?
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:11.680]   Now, we see this attitude of Jesus at the cross, and it's revealed in His seven last
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.960]   sayings on the cross.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:20.480]   In His dying, He shows what it is to entrust yourself to God.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:30.080]   In His unjust treatment, He shows us an example of one who never gave back abuse.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:36.200]   Never threatened, but committed Himself to God.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.200]   Let me just review them.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.460]   I read them earlier.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.720]   In His dying, He shows us really how to live.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.440]   First of all, the first thing He said on the cross, Luke 23:34, "Father, forgive them,
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.380]   for they do not know what they are doing."
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.400]   This is the first principle you see in an example.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.080]   He died seeking forgiveness for the very people who were...
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.400]   For the very people who were harming Him.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:14.460]   This is an example of how we are to respond to those who treat us with revulsion and abuse
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.160]   when we don't deserve it.

[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.520]   They didn't know the importance of life, the Creator and Savior.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.840]   And He knew they needed forgiveness, and that's what He prayed for.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:47.120]   The forgiveness He prayed for was actually made possible by the very suffering He was
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:54.000]   undergoing, not at the hands of men, but at the hands of God.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.080]   He is the perfect pattern of forgiveness, because He can forgive the people who are
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.080]   doing it.
