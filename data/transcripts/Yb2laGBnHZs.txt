[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in the Gospel according to Saint John in the fourth chapter reading verses 13 and 14.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Verses 13 and 14 in the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Jesus answered and said unto her, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again, but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   But the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life."
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Those were the words, as most of you will remember, that were spoken by our blessed Lord and Savior to the woman of Samaria.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   The woman that was living at that very moment a life of open, flagrant sin.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   It is to her that he makes this great statement, or if you prefer it, it is to her that he offers this great and glorious fullness that is to be found and to be found alone in his Gospel.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   You notice how he contrasts it with everything else.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   His claim always was that he was the Savior of the world and that he was the only Savior of the world.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   "Whosoever drinketh of this water," he says, "shall thirst again."
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   That's true, of course, of that actual well by the side of which they were sitting.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   But he uses this to illustrate the world and all that it has to offer.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again."
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   It doesn't satisfy him.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   "But on the contrary, whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never, no, never thirst as long as the world's tender."
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Now this is the claim that we are looking at.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   It is the claim of the Christian Gospel.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   It is what we claim on behalf of this great Christian salvation, that it gives complete satisfaction.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   "Shall never thirst, no, never thirst as long as the world's tender."
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And therefore the question for all of us is this.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Are we experiencing this? Do we realize that this is true?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Have we tried this? Have we tested this?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Well, we are now trying to do that. We are looking at it and we are analyzing it.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   We are considering the Christian life and we are asking questions.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Does it give complete satisfaction?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And we've seen that when you come to the realm of intellect it does so.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   There is a complete intellectual satisfaction given by this Gospel to all who really take of it.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   But at the moment we are looking at the satisfaction that it gives to the heart.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And this is equally important.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   People are constantly swinging from one extreme of the pendulum to the other with regard to these matters.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Some making too much of feeling and emotion, others making nothing of it and dismissing it.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Both are wrong.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   The glory of the Gospel is that it takes up the whole man.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And if our entire person is not involved, there is something wrong somewhere.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   This isn't merely an intellectual belief.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   This isn't merely something that we take up.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It is something that captures us, captivates us, the whole man, the entire person.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And therefore it is important that we should be able to see and to demonstrate
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   that it gives us full and as complete satisfaction to the heart and to the emotions
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   as it does to the intellect and the mind and the understanding.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Now, we've been dealing with this a few Sunday mornings.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   In other words, it is my contention that the Christian is one who is meant to have assurance.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   The Christian is one who is meant to be joyful.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   The term miserable Christian is a contradiction in terms.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   The New Testament Christians were filled with joy and with happiness.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Indeed, it's described as a joy which is unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And that is beyond any question the main reason why Christianity had such an impact upon the ancient world
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   and was able to become within three centuries the controlling power and factor
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   in spite of the fact that it had nothing from the human and material sense to recommend it at all.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   It was the sheer quality of life that these people were living that commended the Gospel wherever they went.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   They were poor people most of them and they had nothing by way of human merit or name or power
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   or scholarship or money or anything like that to recommend them at all.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   They had no advertising media, nothing at all.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   But they lived amongst other people and when these other people saw this joy,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   this joy even in the midst of tribulations, this joy even when they're thrown to the lions in the arena,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   they were arrested and they were made to ask themselves the question,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   "Have I got this?" or "What is it that these people have got that enables them thus to triumph over their circumstances?"
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Now, this wasn't mere resignation. You must be very careful about this.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   This wasn't stoicism. This wasn't grinning and bearing it as it were.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   This wasn't just a tremendous power of the will that enabled them to hold themselves in.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   That's not Christianity. Indeed, it's in many ways the opposite of Christianity.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   The great quality about this is that there is a superabundance, an abounding character.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Now, we saw on Whitsunday, we were pointing out how the effect that was made upon the people in Jerusalem was,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   the effect of the disciples and others upon them was, to make some of them think that these men were drunk.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Now, that's the kind of life that this drinking of this water produces.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   It's not a mere rigid control, strong will and grit and determination, stoicism.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   It isn't that. That's entirely different.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Here there is something extra, something exuberant, filled with new wine.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And this is the character of this joy that we are considering together.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Now, the point I'm making at the moment is that this joy is given to us mainly as the result of the work and the operation of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   He in particular has been sent and given to us in order that he may do this.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   You see, that's where that second chapter of Acts is so vitally important to all of us.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   There is the thing, as it were, there's the great example, the great sample of it.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And the thing that strikes you at once is the joy and the exhilaration that characterized those people.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Well, it was the coming upon them of the Holy Ghost in the baptism of the Spirit that did that.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And we see it repeated in Acts 4 and in other places.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And you see it in the teaching of the epistles, which are a kind of explanation of what you have in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   You can't understand the epistles except in the light of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   They expound what we see there in actual practice, in actual operation.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   And I say therefore this is mainly the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And he does it partly, directly, by coming upon us.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   There are visitations of the Spirit.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   This can happen to the individual.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   It happens to numbers together in periods of what we call revival.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   That is what a revival is.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It's another descent of the Spirit, another baptism of the Spirit, if you like, an outpouring of the Spirit.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And it always has this same effect of filling people with joy and assurance and happiness and certainty.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   But it can happen, as I say, to the individual also.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Well, that's what I've called the direct operation of the Spirit.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   But he also does this indirectly, and that's what we were considering last Sunday.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Not only in regeneration, but particularly in producing what Paul calls the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   This is a more gradual work.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   This is something that he does, as it were, indirectly.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   The Spirit is forming Christ in us.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   He's reproducing in us the character, the life of the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And that life is always characterized by what Paul calls the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   But even that doesn't exhaust the way in which the Spirit gives us this joy, this heart satisfaction.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   What else does he do?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Well, this is the most important matter.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   He does this, and I would say that this is the, from the practical standpoint, the chief method.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   He does it through the Scriptures.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And this is the thing to which we must pay attention now.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Why have we got the Scriptures at all?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   And there's really only one answer to that.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   And that is that we may know the character of this salvation that is given to us.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   John, in writing his first epistle, says quite plainly,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   "These things write I unto you that believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, that ye may know."
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   In other words, the object of the Scriptures is really to give us assurance.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   That is why they were ever written.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   And it is the work of the Holy Spirit that produced them.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   This is how the Scriptures have come into being.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   They're not ordinary writings. It's not a man sitting down and deciding to write certain things.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   No, that isn't how it happens.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   The Scriptures are the result of the fact that certain men are taken hold of,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   and they are dealt with by the Spirit, who does two things to them.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   He gives them a revelation of the truth, and an understanding of it.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Now, no man can do this in and of himself.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And these apostles are very careful to say this.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   The apostle Paul keeps on saying that a dispensation of the gospel, he says, has been committed unto me.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   What he means by that is that the revelation has been given to him.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Take, for instance, what he says about the communion table.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   "I delivered unto you that which I also received, that the Lord Jesus, the night in which he was betrayed, so are."
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Now, this was all by revelation. And he keeps on saying that.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   "That it came to me," he says, "by revelation."
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   In writing to the Galatians he says, "I certify you, brethren," and it's the most important statement, this,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   "I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after men,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   for I neither received it of men," in other words, I taught it, "but by the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Now, that's, our Lord does it through the Spirit.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   He illumined the minds of these men, and he gave them the truth, and he gave them the power to grasp it and to understand it.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   But then, in addition to that, he gave them the ability and the power to write it.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   And he controls them in the writing of it. That's what we call inspiration.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   There is a difference between revelation and inspiration.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   The inspiration is the power and the capacity given to the men to record in an accurate manner this revelation that has been given to him.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And the inspiration is as necessary as the revelation.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Because if men, these men had been left to themselves, though they've had the true revelation,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   they might some way or another make a mistake or an error in the recording of it.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   So inspiration is as essential as the revelation.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   And it is the Holy Spirit that does this.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Now, here it is then, he has taken hold of certain men, chiefly these apostles.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   And those who are under the influence of the apostles. Apostolicity is always the test of hellenicity, of what is truly inspired.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   And, having taken hold of these men, he dealt with them in this way.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   The result is that you and I have the Scriptures.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   And this is the work of the Spirit.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Very well, you remember how our Lord had promised this.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   He said when he comes, he will lead you into all truth.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   And he will explain to you these things that I've been telling you.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   He'll bring them to remembrance and so on.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   That's it. That's how we've got our Scriptures.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   But you see, if he stopped at that, it wouldn't lead to this result of producing joy in us.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Something further is necessary.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   What is that?
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Well, it is what he does in us.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Because, here it is, here the Bible is, here it is translated into English.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Before us all, you can buy a Bible whenever you like.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   And there are thousands, millions of Bibles in this country.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And yet we know that the vast majority of the people of this country don't believe in the Christian message.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   They haven't drunk of this water that Christ offered them.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   By now I'm told the figure is down to 8%. Only 8% of the people of this country even claim to be Christian at all.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   With all the Bibles. Why is this?
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Well, the obvious explanation is that they can't understand the Bible.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And they can't.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   A natural man cannot understand the Bible. Quite impossible.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   He's familiar with the words.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   He can take word by word and he can give you the meaning of the word.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   But he doesn't follow that he understands the meaning of the sentence or of the verse.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   He can tell you what the letter is, but he knows nothing about the spirit.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And that is why, though people have got their Bibles, it doesn't make them Christian.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   The possession of a Bible, the ability to read a Bible, doesn't make a man a Christian.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   This is, of course, one of the most important things of all.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   That's why you're constantly reading in books and articles and journals
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   and hearing people talking on the television and the wireless about the Bible.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And they twist it completely and they show that they just understand nothing at all about it.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   They only know the letter.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   They've missed the whole point, which is the spirit.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Why? Well, because they're natural men.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   They haven't got the spirit.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   And without the spirit, no one can understand these things at all.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Neither can he know them, for they are spiritually discerned.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   He listens to the preaching of the Gospel, he sees nothing in it.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   He reads the Bible, sees nothing in it at all.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   It doesn't matter how able he is, he may be a genius.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   It doesn't help him. It doesn't help him at all.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   To be a great genius and to understand English literature or to understand philosophy or science,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   it doesn't help him at all when you read the Scriptures.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Indeed, it may be a hindrance, because you are bringing your natural understanding
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   to something that is not open to natural understanding.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   There's only one way whereby any man can ever understand the Scriptures
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   that have been produced through men by the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   What's that?
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Well, it is that the same Holy Spirit does in his mind, from the standpoint of reception,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   what he has already done in the minds of the writers from the standpoint of giving.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Now, this is the most marvelous thing.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And we ought to be able to understand this kind of thing at the present time,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   perhaps more easily than many of our forefathers.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   We are helped by illustration.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   This whole question of radio, wireless, are the helpers.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   You have your transmitter, yes, but you have to have the receiving apparatus.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   And you need the same electric power, you see, you need the same delicacy
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   in the receiving as well as in the transmitting.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   These two things are absolutely essential.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Many people seem to fail to grasp this point and seem to think that a mechanical distribution of Scriptures
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   is in and of itself going to do something.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   It can't.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   The Scriptures are essential, but the Scriptures alone are not sufficient.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   The world proves that at the present time this other thing is necessary.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And this is how John puts it.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   He's in his first epistle again in the second chapter.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   He's writing to these early Christians, and they were a little bit confused
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   because there were false teachers amongst them.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   There have always been false teachers.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   The modern heresies are not modern.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   They're old heresies repeated in different forms.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   And there were these so-called antichrists.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   And John says, "They went out from us, but they were not of us.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   But they went out that they might be made manifest, but they were not all of us."
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Well, now, how was it one of these early Christians to know who was the right teacher
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   and who was the wrong teacher?
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   He's going to be saved from error and heresy.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   This is part of his answer in the 20th verse.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   "But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things."
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   He says it again in verse 27 of that second chapter.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   He says, "These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   seduce you with false teaching.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   And you need not that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teaches you
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   of all things and is truth and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   you shall abide in him."
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Now, you see, that is the thing that is absolutely essential
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   before we derive any benefit from the Scriptures at all.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And the first thing we have to realize, therefore, is that when we come to read the Scriptures
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   we need something which is beyond ourselves.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   We don't rely on human ability, human understanding, or any gift we may have.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   We need this anction, this anointing.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   That's why we should never read the Scriptures without praying.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   That is why you should never read the Bible without realizing you are doing something exceptional.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   And you offer a prayer, not just mechanically, but you ask God to illumine
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   and enlighten your mind and your understanding in order that you may be enabled to receive
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   this thing that is contained in the Scriptures.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   What is this thing that is contained in them?
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Well, John again, in a very wonderful way, expands this.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   He says at the beginning, in the fourth verse of the first chapter of his first epistle,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   "These things write we unto you, that your joy may be full."
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Very well. That is my whole contention.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   That one of the ways in which the Holy Spirit gives us this joy,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   gives us this assurance and certainty,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   gives us this extra plus quality that makes the Christian a man who is more than conqueror
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   over everything that is set against him.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   The way in which he does it, in addition to the ways we've already dealt with,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   is by giving us the Scriptures.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   "These things write we unto you, that your joy may be full."
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   And again in the thirteenth verse of the fifth chapter,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   "These things have I written unto you, that believe on the name of the Son of God,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   that you may know that you have eternal life,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God."
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   My dear friends, here's the whole question for us.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Do you know that you've got eternal life?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Is this joy in you?
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   What our Lord was saying to the women of Samaria was just that.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   springing up into everlasting life."
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Have you got this?
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   This is full satisfaction to the heart.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   This is joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   And you get it through the Scriptures.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Sometimes, as I've said, he pours it in our hearts.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Perhaps when we are seated alone without a Bible, he suddenly does it.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   But not always. This is the common way. This is the regular way.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   This is the usual way.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   The Scriptures have been given in order that we might have this great joy and rejoicing.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Well then, how do the Scriptures do this?
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Well, you see, these things, these are the things we take for granted.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And I suppose our main trouble as Christians is
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   that we so often miss the wood because of the trees.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   We are so concerned about details and minutiae that we miss the big grand thing itself.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Now, how do the Scriptures give us this joy and assurance?
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Well, they really do it by unfolding to us
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   and what he has done for us.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   That's what they do. That's how they do it.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   That's how the Scriptures give us joy.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Have you noticed in the epistles, how so often the apostle puts it like this,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   "Rejoice in the Lord always."
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And again I say, rejoice, yes, but rejoice in the Lord.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Or take the way in which he puts it in the epistle to the Philippians in another place.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   He says, "We are the circumcision."
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Who? Well, we are the circumcision who worship God in the Spirit
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Rejoice in Christ Jesus. Rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   And again I say, rejoice.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Now, this is the key to the whole thing.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   John in the first epistle, from which I've already quoted,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   tells them, as I say, that he writes to them in order that their joy may be full.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Well, how is he going to give them this fullness of joy?
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Well, he tells them quite plainly at the very opening of his entire epistle.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   He puts it in these words,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard and which we have seen with our eyes
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   and we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   For the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   and show unto you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested unto us.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the Father
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   and with his Son Jesus Christ."
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Then he goes on to say, "I'm writing all this to you about him in order that your joy may be full."
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   It's always the same.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Look at John's gospel.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God."
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Why does he ever write that gospel? There's only one answer.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   He was writing it in order to confirm the faith of these early Christians.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   That's why the gospels were ever written.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   People were Christians before the gospels were ever written
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   and before the epistles were ever written.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Christ was preached.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   And the people had been given power to believe by the Spirit and they'd been added to the church.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Why then do you ever get your scriptures?
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Why the gospels? Why the epistles?
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Why they're necessary?
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   They are necessary and rarely to confirm Christians in the faith.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   The scriptures are rarely for believers.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Their original intent and design is to establish believers in the truth and in the faith.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   You see, the heresies were coming in.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   That our Lord was only God and not man, or that he was only man and not God.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   And so all these scriptures are written and they're all written really about him.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   That's what the scriptures are for.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   They're to tell us about him and what he has done for us and our relationship to him.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   And as we grasp their teaching, we shall be filled with joy.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Now, this is the most important matter in that it helps us to see very clearly
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   the nature and the character of the Christian's joy.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   And it enables us to differentiate between this joy and all mere superficial excitements and passing emotions.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   There is nothing more pathetic than when the church tries directly to make people happy and to produce joy.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   It's very sad because it's a denial of the gospel.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   You know they do that.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Music of certain types, hand clapping, various things to stimulate people, different colored lights.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   All aesthetic and psychological methods and agencies and then the psychological pep talk as it were,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   all to make people bright and happy.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   What a contradiction it is of the New Testament joy.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   It's so sad.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   No, no.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   We must realize that the character and the nature of the joy that the New Testament speaks about
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   and the Lord speaks about is in a category on its own.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   It's entirely different from all mere excitement of the flesh, titillation of the flesh, passing emotions.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   No, no.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   True joy and happiness are always deep and always have a solid foundation in the understanding.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   That's the great message of the New Testament.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Joy is not something superficial and excited.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   It's deep, it's solid, it's profound, and it's always based upon a true understanding.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Now, let me work that out in a number of propositions.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Here's one of them.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   The Christian should never seek for joy as an end in and of itself.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Never.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   There's no greater fallacy than that.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   We must never seek joy directly, immediately, in and of itself.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Why is that?
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Well, it is because of the nature of this joy.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   And secondly, if we do that, well, the joy we'll get will be a spurious joy.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   That, of course, is what the cults do.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   The cults deliberately set out to give us what we want.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   And they know that we're unhappy, we're miserable, we're troubled by the world,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   we want joy and peace.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And they've given us, they've got the agency, they've developed a form, a kind of ritual,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   a technique, that's the word, technique, to give us this thing we want.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   And of course, they give a temporary satisfaction, like drinking of that well out of the water.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   But it doesn't last, it isn't solid, it isn't true.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Now, the first rule, therefore, is that we must never seek joy as an end in and of itself.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Never.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Secondly, and this follows, of course, the Christian realizes that joy, Christian joy,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   is always a by-product of something else.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   And what's that?
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Well, it is our relationship to the Lord.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And again I say rejoice.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   In other words, the New Testament never comes to us and says, be happy, you ought to be happy,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   make yourself happy, come along, let's be all happy together.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   That's the flesh, that's the world, that's exactly what the world does.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Song leader, appropriate music, band, this, that, come along, it's all just,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   that's remote from the New Testament.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   It is really almost the exact antithesis.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   No, no, joy in the New Testament is a by-product.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   It's something that results from something else.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   And that something else is our relationship to the Lord.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   And again I say rejoice.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Well, let me put it in this way.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   The Christian's joy is based on the realization of what he is.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   And therefore to the Christian, what he is, is much more important than what he may feel like.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   It's much more important than what may be happening to him.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Now this again is one of these basic central foundational principles of the whole Christian position.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   All these New Testament writers, from the very beginning of the book of Acts onwards,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   and of course the thing is implicit in the Gospels as well,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   but it is particularly the theme of the epistles, is this.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Their emphasis is for us to realize who and what we are.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   And we must put that first, what I am is very much more important than what I feel.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   What I am is very much more important than what is happening to me.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Now let me show you what I mean.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   It is the failure to realize this, that more commonly than anything else,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   robs us of this joy which our Lord offers us, and the happiness that he offers us.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   This is how it's lost.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Take, let me give you an example.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Take what the Apostle Paul says in the 8th chapter of the epistle to the Romans, verses 18 and following.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   "I have reckoned," he says, "that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us."
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Why does he say that, and all that follows?
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Well he says it for this reason.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   These early Christians were in trouble.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   They were suffering, they were being persecuted, things were going wrong.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   And some of them because of this had lost their joy.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   And some of them were even beginning to doubt whether their faith was real, or whether the gospel was true.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Why? Well they'd obviously got a false notion.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Their idea you see was this, "Believe the gospel and you'll be happy ever afterwards."
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, you'll never have any more troubles,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   you'll walk down the road of life with head erect and have never any troubles again."
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   What nonsense it is, what utter nonsense.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   You see it's putting the wrong emphasis.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   No, no, the Apostle writes then to them to get them to realize
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   that their joy must not be dependent upon what is happening to them.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Their joy must not be dependent on how they feel.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Their joy is to be based upon what they are.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Their relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ and what that is going to lead to.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Well how does he know that that's going to be revealed in us?
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   He's already told us.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   "The Spirit beareth witness with our spirits that we are the children of God."
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   "And if children then heirs, heirs of God and blind heirs with Christ."
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   "That if we suffer with him we shall also be glorified together."
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   "It's all dependent upon my relationship to him."
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   "And the way to preserve joy therefore is not to be controlled and governed by your feelings and moods and states."
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   "Nor by what is happening to you."
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   "If you do either of those you'll be miserable and you'll be unhappy."
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   "Because this is an evil world and there are evil people in it."
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   "And there is illness and accident and death and sorrow."
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   "And you'll never be happy you'll always be miserable."
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   "So the way of the New Testament is not seeking joy."
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   "But having certainty and assurance with regard to who you are, what you are."
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   "Your relationship to him and all that is implicit in that."
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   "Now this is, you see, foundational in this whole matter of joy."
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   "And so the last deduction I draw about the character of this joy is this."
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   "That the way to obtain this joy and happiness therefore is not to look into myself."
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   "Or to try to produce the joy."
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   "Never, you must never do that."
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   "It is always to look unto Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith."
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   "And that is the message of the entire New Testament."
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   "Look unto Jesus."
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   "You see, he himself said, 'In the world you shall have tribulation."
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   "But fear not, I have overcome the world."
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   "Our Lord has never promised us an easy time in this world."
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   "He's never taught a kind of joviality and the happiness."
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   "Back-slapping Christianity if you like."
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   "It's the denial, it's the antithesis of what one finds in the New Testament."
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   "You see, people have got this foolish notion that you can't be happy and serious at the same time."
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   "That's where the trouble comes in, but you can."
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   "The only joy that is worth having is a serious joy."
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   "It's a sober joy, it's a deep joy."
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   "It's a solid joy, solid joys and lasting treasures."
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   "None but Zion's children know."
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   "It is this element of solidity that matters."
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   "And that is because it is always the result and the outcome of our relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   "Very well."
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   "Are you a depressed Christian?"
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   "Did you come into this service dejected this morning?"
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   "Do you feel that all things are against you?"
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   "To drive you to despair?"
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   "Are you having a hard time in your Christian and your spiritual life?"
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   "And you've come to this service this morning, hoping for something."
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   "What are you hoping for?"
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   "How do you think it's going to come to you?"
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   "What's my business?"
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   "Is it my business to make you happy?"
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   "No, no, my friends, I'm not a psychologist."
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   "I'm a preacher of the gospel."
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   "It's not my business to make you happy."
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   "If it were, well, I'd bring a supply of drugs."
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   "Or a drink."
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   "Or I'd have some orchestra here."
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   "I'd do a thousand and one things."
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   "But that's not my calling."
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   "And it wouldn't be Christian joy."
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   "My business is not just to make you feel happy while you're here."
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   "And then let you go back and face the tragedy and the problem of life exactly as it was."
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   "That's a cheat. That's a lie."
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   "That's an artifact."
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   "It's not true. It's not clean. It's not honest."
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   "Above all, it's not Christian."
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   "No, no."
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   "What have I got to do?"
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   "All I've got to do is to tell you about him."
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   "My business is to try to do what the Apostle John did."
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   "He's anxious that their joy may be full."
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   "How does he do it?"
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   "Well, to tell about him whom they've seen, touched, felt, handled, heard."
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   "They're bearing witness."
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   "And this is the only way in which we can have this joy and heart satisfaction that he talks about."
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   "In other words, what you do here is this."
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   "You don't look into yourself."
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   "You look out from yourself and forget yourself and you look at him."
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   "Now this is, of course, again a great kind of watershed as between the true Christian message and what passes in general under the name of mysticism."
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   "There is a true mysticism, a Christ mysticism."
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   "But it's the only true mysticism."
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   "Every other type of mysticism is bad because it starts by telling you, 'Look into yourself.'"
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   "Look into the divine spark that's in you."
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   "Look to something in yourself."
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   "They say, 'Don't look at the world, the world's against you. Look into yourself."
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   "You've got it all there if you could only see it and let it come out."
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   "Now that's the antithesis again of this message."
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   "It doesn't look into yourself."
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   "It looks unto Jesus."
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   "Look away from yourself. Look out of yourself. Look at him."
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   "There's only one way to go through this world, triumphant and happy and joyful."
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   "And it is to keep your eyes steadfastly upon him."
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   "Now, you see, he did all this himself. Let me show you."
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   "This, you see, is the way to get John."
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   "You look at him. What do you look at?"
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   "Well, you start by looking at the person."
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   "You realize who he is."
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   "He says this himself to the woman of Samaria."
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   "Here is our Lord, seated."
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   "Jesus, therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well."
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   "And it was about the sixth hour."
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   "There cometh the woman of Samaria to draw water."
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   "Jesus saith unto her, 'Give me to drink.'"
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   "Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, 'How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest me to drink?'"
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   "'If you askest drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria, for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.'"
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   "Jesus then said unto her, 'If thou knowest the gift of God, and who it is that saith unto thee, 'Give me to drink,'"
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   "'thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.'"
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Oh, this is one of the greatest dramas, I think, that's extinct, and in all literature.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   Can't you see it?
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   Here is a woman in desperate need, living in adultery at that moment.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Oh, the poor woman, her need is tremendous.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   And here is the one who can satisfy every need.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   But there is one thing that's absolutely essential before she'll get it.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   And that is, one thing that she realizes who he is.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   If she doesn't realize that, she'll remain as she is.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   He can only give this living water as she realizes who he is.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   "'If thou knewest who it is that saith unto thee, 'Give me to drink,'"
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   "'thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.'"
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Now, this is always the starting point.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   You see, if you're in trouble, if you're unhappy,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   if circumstances and trials are pressing upon you,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   what's the method of the New Testament?
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Well, it isn't to deal with your problems and troubles directly.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   It's to ask you to look at him.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   He will never deal with your problems and difficulties directly,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   unless you're in the right relationship to him.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   The benefits of Christianity only come to those who believe the message concerning him.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Now, you see, the fallacies that come in at this point.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   People want the benefits of Christianity.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   They want this and that and the other, and they don't get it.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   People come for peace, for joy, for healing, this, that, and the other,
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   and they don't get it.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   And they say, "There's nothing in it."
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   No, no, they haven't understood it.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   They think they can get the results and the benefits
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   without the faith that is, first of all, essential.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   In other words, as I've often put it, I must put it again like this.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   The first thing the New Testament tells every one of us is this.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   The real trouble with you is what you are.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   It isn't your circumstances.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   It isn't your illness.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   It isn't your accident.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   It isn't your surroundings.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   It isn't other people.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   The real trouble is you, yourself.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   And it says that to every one of us.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   It convicts us of our sin.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   And this is always the beginning.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   So it confronts us with him.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   It doesn't deal with the situation as we think it will.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   It has its own method, and it's a radical one.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   And it starts by telling us that what we are, I say,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   is more important than anything that's true about us.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   And then that immediately is put into the relationship,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   which is absolutely essential, namely, our relationship to him.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   So you start by looking at him.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   You say, "This is hard. I'm in trouble."
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   All right, it's because you're in trouble I'm telling you to look at him.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   The woman of Samaria was in terrible trouble,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   and she went on arguing and disputing until he nails her down,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   and she's got to realize who he is.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Then she gets the help.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Never until then.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   And it's always like this.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   You see, all our troubles arise from the fact
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   that we are estranged from God,
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   that we are under the wrath of God,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   that we are not the children of God.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   All our troubles come from that.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   So the New Testament doesn't try to tinker with our problems here and there
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   and put on a patch here and a patch there.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   No, no, it says you must be born again.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   The whole thing has got to start afresh.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   And you do this by looking at him.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   Now, I could give you endless examples and illustrations of what I'm saying.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Let me give you perhaps what is one of the most striking of them all.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Take the great epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   There it is, a long epistle of 13 chapters.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Why was this epistle ever written?
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Well, the answer is the same.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   The epistle to the Hebrews was written to Hebrew Christians
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   who were in a state of unhappiness.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   They were in a state of dejection.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Many of them were even threatening to give up Christianity altogether
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   and to go back to the old Jewish religion in the temple
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   with the priests and the high priest and all the animal sacrifices.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   That was the actual position in which they were.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   That is why this man has to give them such terrible warnings
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   about turning away from the gospel.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Now, why were they in that position?
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   Well, they were in that condition because of the things that had been happening to them.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   Listen, he reminds them of it.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   He says, "Call to remembrance the former days in which, after you were illuminated,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   you endured a great fight of afflictions,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   partly whilst you were made a gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   and partly whilst you became companions of them that were so used.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   For you had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward."
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Now all that means this.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   At first, when they believed the gospel,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   they were filled with joy and with happiness,
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   in spite of the fact that they were being persecuted and so on.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   But now, they were unhappy.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   And they were unhappy because of these things that were happening to them.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   You notice, he says, some of them were even being robbed of their goods.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   They were being maltreated, they were being vilely treated,
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   persecuted by their own relatives, the Jews,
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   who hated them because they had become Christians.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   And they were undergoing the most terrible trials and persecutions.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   And the result of all this was they were cast down
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   and they were beginning to look back to the old Jewish religion.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Shall we go back to that?
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Have we made a mistake in believing this new teaching?
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   That was the whole cause of their trouble.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   Now, these people were in a really pathetic position.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   But how does this man deal with them?
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   Listen. Here they are.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   Keep the picture in your mind.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Unhappiness, dejection, trials, troubles, tribulations, persecutions.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   This is the remedy.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   God, who at sundry times and in divers manners,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   whom he hath appointed heir of all things,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   by whom also he made the worlds,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   who, being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   and upholding all things by the word of his power,
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   when he hath by himself purged our sins,
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   shalt down on the right hand of the majesty on high.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   That's what's supposed to make them happy.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Does it make you happy?
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   How have you viewed the epistle to the Hebrews?
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   Have you sometimes said a thing like this?
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Oh, well, of course, those people,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   they've got time to be interested in great statements like that.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   That's theology.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   That's just theology, that is. That's doctrine.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   I want something practical. I want something to help me.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   I'm in trouble. Life's very hard.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   I haven't got time to try and understand these great statements,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   these great theological propositions.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   I can't. I want some immediate practical help.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   I know you do, and that's why you are what you are.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   This is the only help.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   There is no other.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   And that's why this man starts with it.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   There is no easy comfort offered in the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   What the man is really saying to them is this.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   Look here. You are unhappy and you're miserable,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   and you're threatening to go back. Why?
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   Because you have failed to realize the truth about him.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   So he starts with it.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   You come back, he says, and realize the truth about him,
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   and all your troubles will leave you for the nonce.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   They'll still be there, but they won't get you down.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   You'll be filled with joy in spite of them.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   It's the only answer.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   Looking unto Jesus.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   This is the way to get joy.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   To contemplate the glory of this blessed person.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Who is he?
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Well, he is the brightness of God's glory
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   and the express image of God's person.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   He's God, the eternal Son.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   He's the one we are concerned about.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   He's the one who's coming to this world
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   in order to put us right with God.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   Whatever you may feel, whatever's happening to you,
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   don't look at them, look at him.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   And realize that he has it in him
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   to give you all you need and infinitely more.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   He looks at you as you are this morning,
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   in your very situation, however desperate it may be.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   And you know what he says to you.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   He says to you what he says to the woman of Samaria.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   "I'm not just a Jew."
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   That's what she said.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   "How is it that thou, being a Jew,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   askest water of me, who am a woman of Samaria?"
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   He says to you as he says to her,
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   "I'm not just a man.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   I'm not just a Jew.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   I'm not just a man amongst men.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   I'm not just a traveler.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   I'm not just a teacher.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   I'm not just a philosopher.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   I'm not just a pacifist.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   I'm not just a politician.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   No, no, look at me again.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   If thou knewest."
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   And that's what he's saying to you.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   If you only knew who I am
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   and what I've got to give you.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   shall never thirst.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   But the water that I shall give him
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   shall be in him a well of water
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   springing up into everlasting life."
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   I, this is the thing,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   the water that I shall give him.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   Look at him again.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   Look into his eyes.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Look into his face.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   Realize that this is the Son of God,
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   the brightness of his glory,
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   and the express image of his person.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   And he has come to supply you of every need.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   But you can only get it from him.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   And as you realize the truth concerning him.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   The closing hymn is hymn number 84.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   Charles Wesley looking at him.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   Let us look at him with Charles Wesley.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   Hark the herald angels sing glory to the new born King.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   Hymn number 84.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   [organ music]

[00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   [choir singing]
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   [choir singing]
