[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   [silence]
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.820]   So how can we overcome procrastination?
[00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.080]   Well, it turns out that there are findings
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.140]   from within the addiction literature
[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.820]   that turn out to be very powerful
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.900]   towards leveraging our way out of procrastination.
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.580]   And it has to do with this.
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.620]   You already know,
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.860]   because I've told you probably a dozen times now,
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.940]   that the depth of the trough after a dopamine peak
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.900]   is proportional to how high that peak was
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.140]   and how steep it was, how quickly that peak occurred.
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.620]   It turns out that not only is the depth of the trough
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.980]   proportional to that,
[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.780]   but the rate at which you get out of that trough
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.200]   is proportional to how steep that trough is.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.460]   Let me explain this for you
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.360]   in as clear terms as I possibly can.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.760]   Imagine you're in an amotivated state.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.100]   You're just not feeling motivated, you're procrastinating.
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.060]   You may think, okay, the thing to do here is something.
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.040]   I'll clean the house, I'll take care of some bills,
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.780]   I'll do something, or I'll just wait.
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.460]   Those approaches, as we talked about before,
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.140]   generally don't work, or at least don't work quickly,
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.660]   or they lead you right up to the deadline,
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.780]   and that's the deadline that forces you to get something done
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.060]   or you just don't get it done
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.540]   and you don't succeed in your goal.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.200]   That happens a lot as well.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.740]   However, if you were to take that state
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.940]   of being unmotivated, of procrastinating,
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.380]   and actually do something that's harder
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.500]   than being in that amotivated state,
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.640]   in other words, doing something that's more effortful,
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.160]   even painful, you can rebound yourself
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.400]   out of that dopamine trough much more quickly.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.400]   So what do I mean you want to put yourself in a state
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.160]   that's worse than or harder than the state that you're in,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.120]   or do something, quote unquote, more painful?
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.280]   And here I want to be very clear.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.280]   I'll say this three times,
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.920]   but I'm going to say it for the first time now.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.840]   When I say more painful,
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.720]   I do not mean doing any kind of tissue damaging
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.880]   or psychologically damaging behavior
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.120]   or anything of that sort that's going to render you injured
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.160]   or not well, even in the short term.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.720]   That's not what I'm referring to, okay?
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.240]   Let's just get that one out of the way.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.240]   What I'm referring to is the fact that, for instance,
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.080]   if you're feeling amotivated,
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.120]   but you find yourself cleaning the house
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.680]   as a way to procrastinate,
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.920]   you can say, well, cleaning the house is harder
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.360]   than sitting down and doing nothing,
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.440]   but actually in that moment or in those moments,
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.160]   that's not the case, or else you wouldn't be doing it.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.320]   The reality is that the dopamine system works
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.020]   according to what feels hard or easy in the moment.
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.400]   In other words, if you're feeling amotivated,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.840]   you need to do something and put yourself into a state
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.960]   that's harder than the state you're in.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.200]   So for instance, if you're sitting around
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   feeling amotivated or you find yourself
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.140]   tending to tasks that are irrelevant to the goal
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.560]   that you really should be focused on,
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.700]   you need to put your body and mind
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.980]   into a state of discomfort quickly.
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.320]   And the way to do that
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.680]   is to either engage in some tangential activity,
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.620]   meaning an activity not related to your goal,
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.040]   that puts your body into a very different state.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.080]   So here again, I'll default to the obvious one,
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.340]   which is something like cold shower or cold immersion,
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.040]   which not only increases dopamine long-term
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.720]   or over several hours rather,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.900]   but for most people is experienced as pain.
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.200]   That pain causes a rebound out of that dopamine trough
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.160]   faster than it would occur
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.200]   if you had just stayed in that amotivated state
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.280]   and waited for it to go away
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.560]   or done something like cleaning up
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.720]   that for whatever reason
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.220]   felt like it required less friction.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.120]   When I say friction, I mean, limbic friction.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.120]   Your limbic system is always in this dialogue
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.660]   with your forebrain and limbic friction goes two ways.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.320]   Limbic friction can be you're tired
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.300]   and you don't want to do something.
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.160]   And so you have to quote unquote, motivate to do it,
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.780]   energize yourself to do it,
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.240]   or limbic friction can be that you're nervous and scared
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.280]   and anxious to do something
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.320]   and you have to calm yourself
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.080]   in order to lean forward into action
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.800]   in order to do that thing despite the anxiety.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.920]   I realize this can be a little bit confusing as a concept,
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.440]   so I want to go into a bit more detail.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.740]   Let's imagine that you or somebody else
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.140]   does not like to exercise.
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.080]   You don't want to exercise
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.380]   and you're trying to get your minimum
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.640]   of five days per week exercise
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.200]   and you're just not motivated to do it.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.680]   There are a couple of different techniques to doing this.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.300]   Assuming you've taken care of all the baseline stuff,
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.460]   all the foundational stuff we talked about earlier,
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.820]   and you're just not getting in gear
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.140]   and you find yourself checking your phone
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.260]   or maybe you're tending to some tasks,
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.180]   obviously those things are quote unquote easier for you,
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.500]   meaning they cause less limbic friction
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.620]   than engaging in exercise.
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.280]   The typical advice would be just exercise for one minute.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.700]   Okay, just get one minute of exercise or five minutes
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.760]   and then use the successful completion
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.700]   of that one or five minutes as a milestone
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.000]   that allows you to then move to the next milestone.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.980]   And indeed, that approach can work.
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.920]   And it's exactly what I'm describing here
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.840]   when I say that you're in a state of lack of motivation
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.880]   or procrastination or both,
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.960]   and you need to put yourself into a more painful,
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.000]   not less painful state.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.840]   So what do you do?
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.680]   You push up against that friction
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.200]   and you exercise for a short while,
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.940]   and then that pops you out of that trough.
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.300]   That's possible, but for a lot of people,
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.680]   even that won't be possible
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.020]   because they just can't get motivated
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.420]   or they do that one minute or five minutes
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.540]   and then they're just like, okay, I'm still in the trough.
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.340]   I'm not actually feeling that great.
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.660]   In those circumstances,
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.020]   it makes sense to do something that's tangential
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.160]   to the whole path that you're trying to pursue,
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.560]   this goal that you're trying to pursue.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.000]   That is, believe it or not,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.640]   much worse than just being amotivated.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.840]   And when I say worse,
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.940]   I don't mean picking some task
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.440]   that normally you don't like to do,
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.780]   but now you're willing to do.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.100]   I mean, literally thinking about
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.860]   what would be worse than being in this state?
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.460]   Again, without causing yourself tissue
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.960]   or psychological damage, what would be worse?
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.940]   Well, cold water would be worse for many people,
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.200]   very cold water.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.180]   So the key is to figure out something
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.300]   that for lack of a better way to put it,
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.180]   really sucks, really sucks, and yet is safe.
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.080]   And by doing that, you steepen the trough,
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.960]   you steepen the slope of the trough,
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.160]   which we know brings you back
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.880]   to your baseline level of dopamine more quickly.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.720]   Now, for some people,
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.280]   that will be deliberate cold exposure
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.540]   through cold shower, ice bath.
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.000]   And I have to tell you that if you're cringing
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.400]   as I say this, well then, there you go.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.280]   You now have a tool that you know,
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.480]   you cringe even when you just think about,
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.960]   and therefore represents a great tool for you.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.160]   So if I'm procrastinating
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.880]   to do something I really need to do,
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.300]   should I just simply wait
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.300]   for that procrastination to evaporate?
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.140]   No.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.420]   Will it eventually evaporate?
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.300]   Maybe.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.940]   Will a deadline eventually surface
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.260]   that will trigger me into an anxious or activated state
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.740]   that will allow me to complete what needs to be done?
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.980]   Maybe.
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.380]   Hopefully.
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.740]   But better would be to get out of that amotivated state,
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.100]   that state of procrastination, quickly.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.680]   [upbeat music]
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.100]   [upbeat music]
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.660]   (upbeat music)
