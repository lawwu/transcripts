[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   Can you talk about what you're working on now in the next version of this?
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.360]   I'm thinking about not just the model, I'm thinking about the whole ecosystem.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.040]   I'm thinking about levels of abstraction for how you access these models, whether it's
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.920]   through an API, through our partnerships, or through direct access or integration with SDKs.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.080]   We work, for example, with a lot of open source projects like LandChain and AutoGPT
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.640]   and a bunch of others. Right now, my biggest focus is how do I think about the community and
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.440]   how do I build around Lama models as this kernel of an operating system
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.720]   and bring a more holistic platform for others to build on.
