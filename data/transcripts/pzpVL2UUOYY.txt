[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.980]   the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 20 and verse 24, the 24th verse in the 20th
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.020]   chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.660]   But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.320]   I might finish my course with joy in the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.300]   testify the gospel of the grace of God.
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.020]   Now those who meet here regularly will know that during the Sunday evenings of this month
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.740]   of October, we've been considering together some of these great descriptions which are
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.680]   given us of the gospel of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.060]   And we are obviously continuing with that theme this evening.
[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.940]   And here we consider these words in this passage in the 20th chapter of the Book of the Acts
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.820]   of the Apostles.
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.660]   This passage, it's always seemed to me, is certainly the most lyrical and perhaps one
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:24.660]   of the most moving passages which is to be found in the whole of the Bible.
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.060]   It's grand simply as literature.
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.760]   I never read this passage without being profoundly moved.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.780]   I remember so well the first time that I really saw what it was.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.100]   The trouble with us all is that we tend to read the scriptures with half our minds or
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.860]   even less, and thus we miss their glory.
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.460]   I shall never forget the first occasion when I really first read this passage.
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.460]   It's over thirty-seven years ago, but I still remember it.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.340]   I still recall what I felt on that occasion.
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.380]   Here it is, you see, this grand and great man bidding farewell to the elders of the
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.820]   church at Ephesus, going up to Jerusalem, not knowing what was awaiting him, except
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.180]   that in all cities the Holy Ghost did testify that bonds were in store for him.
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.020]   And so he takes this opportunity of reminding these elders of his ministry, of what he'd
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.220]   done amongst them and what he had done elsewhere.
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.140]   He shows that he's proud of it, proud of his calling.
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.580]   This ministry, he says, "which I have received of the Lord Jesus."
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.460]   There's nothing beyond that, that the Lord Jesus should have given a man a ministry,
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.700]   and he'd given it to the apostle.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.060]   And he glories in it, he rejoices in it, he magnifies his office, as he always does.
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.580]   And he reminds them of how he worked amongst them, not only preaching in public but from
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.880]   house to house, not only by day but also by night.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.700]   He reminds them of all this.
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.900]   He was indefatigable.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.380]   No man ever worked harder than this man.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.500]   And he reminds them even of his tears.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.180]   Twice over he reminds them that he spoke to them with tears.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.580]   But he goes beyond even that.
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.740]   He says that thus he is assured that he's going up to Jerusalem and that bonds await
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.460]   him.
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.540]   But he says, "none of these things move me, they don't disturb me at all.
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.180]   Neither can't I my life dear unto myself."
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.820]   He's ready if necessary to lose his life.
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.360]   He'll go on with the ministry.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.940]   People can't frighten him.
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.020]   We read in the next chapter how they almost physically tried to detain him, but he wouldn't,
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.020]   he would go on.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:51.140]   Here's a man, I say, who's ready if necessary to lose his very life, and he did finally
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.180]   lose it, and many others lost it with him.
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.740]   Now the question is, what explains all this?
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.140]   Why did he feel like that?
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.660]   Why does he magnify his office?
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.260]   Why is he so proud of being a preacher?
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.620]   Why is he ready, as I say, even to suffer death if necessary while preaching this gospel?
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.020]   Now there's only one answer to that question, and that is the answer that he gives here
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.460]   himself.
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:27.940]   It is because it is the gospel of the grace of God, and this has so taken him up and has
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.460]   so charmed him, so filled him with a sense of glory that nothing else really matters.
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.100]   But he goes on preaching not only because the thing itself is so glorious and so wonderful,
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.900]   but also because of his concern for men and women.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.460]   This is what broke his heart in a sense.
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.580]   He looks round and about him, and he sees men and women in sin and in misery and unhappiness,
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.620]   and he says they're like that because they know nothing about this gospel of the grace
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.940]   of God, and he's bound to tell them.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.500]   That's why he tells the Romans that he's a debtor.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.820]   He feels he's a debtor to all men, both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.820]   the wise and to the unwise.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.340]   He's got something, this tremendous thing, the gospel of the grace of God, and men and
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.220]   women don't know about it.
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.420]   And so he says, "I must go on preaching it, whatever happens to me.
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.100]   Whatever the authorities may do to me, they may even kill me.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.100]   That can't stop me.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.220]   I must tell people about this."
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:33.260]   The thing itself is so glorious, the need of the people is so great, and not only that.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:40.220]   He was troubled by the way in which people misunderstood this, and especially those false
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.340]   teachers who dogged his footsteps and who followed him round as he travelled, and who
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.860]   went with their little theories and their pet philosophies, and tried to persuade people
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.020]   that Paul's message wasn't a true one, but that they should listen to them.
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.420]   He reminds, you remember these elders here at Ephesus, how he'd warned them when he was
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.180]   with them that after his departure, people like that would come along, and some might
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.380]   even arise in the church at Ephesus.
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.060]   And he says, "Don't listen to them.
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:18.820]   They haven't got the gospel of the grace of God, these petty little legalists."
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:25.020]   And so, you see, he puts this great and glorious gospel as over and against this false and
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.260]   spurious teaching.
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.380]   Well, that's the character of these men.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.900]   And he was especially troubled by the state and condition of his own fellow countrymen,
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.900]   the Jews.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.700]   This, to him, was the tragedy of tragedies, that there they were, still trying to put
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:48.220]   themselves right with God and failing, and refusing this gospel of the grace of God.
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.420]   So he says, "I don't care what happens to me.
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.900]   I must go and testify to this.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.660]   I must let everybody know about it."
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.140]   Now, my friends, I'm calling your attention to all this, as I've been doing on previous
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.340]   Sunday evenings, for precisely the same reason.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.500]   There is no question that the greatest tragedy in the world tonight is the ignorance of mankind
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.100]   of this gospel.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.180]   The world is in trouble.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.300]   Men and women individually are in trouble.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.300]   Why?
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.900]   Well, because they know nothing about this gospel of the grace of God.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:29.340]   And of course, what heightens the tragedy is this, that this gospel is so misrepresented.
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:36.620]   I have to go on referring to this, and I'm following in the footsteps of the great apostle.
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:46.340]   He reminds these elders of the church at Ephesus how he had reminded them, and that he had
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:52.780]   not ceased to do so, of these dangers that were going to arise.
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:59.060]   There's a foolish, superficial notion current today in many circles in the church that one
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.500]   must never be negative, that one must never denounce false teaching.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.940]   We must praise everybody and everything.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.500]   The apostle Paul didn't do that.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.060]   The apostle Paul did the exact opposite.
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:16.900]   "I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:17.900]   the flock.
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.620]   But because of your own self shall men arise speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.620]   after them."
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:29.420]   Therefore, he says, "Watch, and remember that by the space of three years I cease not
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:35.060]   to warn every one of you night and day with tears."
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.460]   And a man who doesn't expose evil teaching is a man who doesn't know much about the
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.300]   gospel of the grace of God.
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:49.500]   You see, these other teachings, these misrepresentations of the gospel, they're not only wrong, but
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.260]   they're so small.
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:57.380]   As the apostle shows here, "Put them by the side of this gospel of the grace of God."
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.500]   How contemptible they are.
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.900]   And that's the tragedy to me, that men and women should be reducing this gospel, oh,
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:10.300]   to just a little bit of morality or ethics, some of them just to politics.
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:15.020]   But small things, there's no glory about it, there's no majesty, there's nothing thrilling
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.660]   and tremendous.
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.580]   That kind of teaching would never produce a paragraph like this.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:29.780]   Not only that, these teachings that pass as gospel today, so frequently these human philosophies
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:35.940]   and little bit of ethics, and so on, they not only don't compare with what we read here,
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.500]   but you see, they don't even explain how our hymns have ever come into being.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.900]   Where have these great hymns we've been singing tonight come from?
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.700]   Take that last hymn we've been singing.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:55.380]   Would your modern representations of the gospel, which say that God is depth and wherever there's
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.740]   kindness, there's God and His love, would they produce hymns like this?
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:07.060]   Christ is a sweet, a charming theme, my thoughts rejoice at Jesus' name.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.140]   You see, this is the way to test a gospel, or anything that's offering itself to you
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.140]   as a gospel.
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:18.940]   Does it have this effect upon you, that having read it or having heard it, you get up and
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:26.540]   you say, "Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer's praise."
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.540]   That's the test.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.140]   If it doesn't have that effect upon you, well, then you really don't know much about
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.360]   it.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:42.940]   The Mormon, to men, has some kind of insight into this gospel of the grace of God.
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:51.340]   He's filled with a sense of wonder, love, and praise, astonishment and amazement, and
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.940]   he doesn't know how to give expression to that which he feels within his breast.
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.380]   Well, now, then, the question I'm putting to you, therefore, my dear friends, tonight
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.600]   is this.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.620]   Do you want this?
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.540]   Do you want the thousand tongues?
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.900]   Is your understanding of this gospel such that you are moved and thrilled and almost
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.100]   overwhelmed by it, and feel that you can't give expression to it?
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.740]   Here, I say, is the test.
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:23.940]   And the only thing that can ever bring us into such a state or condition is the realization
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:30.260]   of the truth which is put before us so vividly and graphically here by the great Apostle
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.740]   in this wonderful phrase.
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.820]   We've been looking at other aspects.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:40.160]   We've been looking at the historicity, the historical aspect, the beginning of the gospel
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.460]   of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.940]   We've been looking at the element of glory.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:53.740]   We've been looking at its everlasting character, and in doing so, we have seen that the gospel
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:58.980]   tells us a great deal about the wisdom of God and about the power of God.
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.980]   You see, it's all about God.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:06.140]   It's the glorious gospel of the blessed God, the gospel of the glory of the blessed
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.140]   God.
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.020]   And, you see, if your gospel doesn't give you some new understanding of the being and
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:17.500]   the character of God himself, well, you may very well be believing some bit of psychological
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.660]   teaching using the name of Jesus.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:28.540]   But the gospel always makes a man feel filled with a sense of amazement at the wisdom and
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.660]   at the power of God.
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:37.260]   But not only that, says the Apostle, it shows in a very particular manner the grace of God.
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.620]   And that's the thing that's engaging our attention on this particular occasion.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:46.780]   "Oh, I don't care what they do to me," says Paul, "none of these things move me,
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:51.580]   neither count I my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy and
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:58.140]   the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the good news of the
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.140]   grace of God."
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:06.580]   Now, the word "grace" really introduces us to something of the glorious content of
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.580]   the statement.
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:16.340]   Grace means favor shown to the utterly undeserving, favor and kindness shown to people who don't
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.340]   deserve it.
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:22.100]   Very well, the Apostle says here, this is the way he describes it here, that the gospel
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.940]   is the gospel of the grace of God.
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.340]   What's it mean?
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.940]   Well, let me try to hold it before you.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:35.680]   I want to make you sing, my friends, and a preacher who doesn't make his congregation
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.020]   sing is a very poor, very poor preacher.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:45.220]   You don't make people sing by just exhorting them to morality, you don't make them sing
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.220]   by just asking them to imitate Jesus.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.460]   That never made me sing, that makes me feel a sense of utter despair.
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:55.740]   I can't satisfy myself, leave alone imitate Christ.
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.700]   But the gospel makes people sing, and only the gospel of the grace of God can ever do
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.700]   that.
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.700]   Now then, what's it mean?
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.980]   Well, the first thing he tells us is this, that the very fact that there is any good
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:15.020]   news at all in the world tonight is solely due to the grace of God, a gospel.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:19.260]   And gospel, remember, means good news.
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:24.980]   In a world of darkness, in a world of despair, there is good news tonight.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:25.980]   Everything is not hopeless.
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.580]   There is a way of deliverance, there is a way of escape, there is good news.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:35.060]   And what this tells us is that the fact that there is a gospel at all, that there is good
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.940]   news at all, that there is any hope in the world tonight, is entirely due to the fact
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.620]   that God is a God of grace.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.620]   What does that mean?
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.900]   Well, it means this.
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:52.420]   It all arises in the character of God himself.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.540]   That's what grace really means.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.900]   God hasn't responded to anything that's gone up from men.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.380]   The gospel isn't God's reply to anything.
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.380]   No, no, it began with him.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.860]   So many people seem to think of it that other way around.
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:16.380]   That we go in our troubles to God and we say we are sorry and we ask, and that God responds.
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.020]   That's not gospel.
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.220]   That's not gospel.
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.860]   The gospel is the gospel of the grace of God.
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.620]   He doesn't merely respond to us, he initiates.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.660]   This is the great message of the whole of the Bible.
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:39.620]   That God has planned and purposed redemption, salvation.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.340]   And that he has done so before the foundation of the world.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.260]   So it can't be a response to anything in us.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.420]   Because God had planned this before we were, before anybody was, before the world had ever
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.380]   come into being or existence.
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.780]   All this was planned before the foundation of the world.
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.780]   It came out of the mind and the heart of God himself.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:05.020]   It is an expression of this quality of grace.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:11.020]   And that is, of course, the very essence of the gospel.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.380]   And as I've been pointing out, it is the only hope in the world tonight.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.820]   There's nothing else.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:23.340]   Everything else we know has already been tried and it's already been proved to be a failure.
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.460]   That's why we are so silly to get excited about modern theories.
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:30.180]   They're all repetitions of something that's been before.
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.020]   There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.740]   You've had your idealism before and all your other philosophical theories.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.740]   There's nothing new.
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.380]   You know, the Greek philosophers had rarely put thought right through.
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.620]   There's been no addition to them, really.
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.560]   There's been modification of their theories.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.220]   There's been no addition.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:52.220]   It was when the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of the thing
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.180]   preached to save them that believe.
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.140]   It's always been like that.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:02.980]   And I say, therefore, that there is no hope in the world tonight, there is no good news
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.500]   in the world tonight, apart from this.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.680]   But here it is, and this is the whole message of the Bible.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.060]   We are conscious of failure and we wonder what can be done.
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.620]   Here comes the answer.
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:18.460]   God's got a plan, God has worked out a plan, and God has been putting that plan into operation.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.620]   That's the message of the Bible.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:24.420]   God's grace being put into execution in the plan of salvation.
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.300]   The Bible, if you like, is the history of redemption.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:34.300]   It's the account of how God is saving a people for himself and will finally save the
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.300]   whole universe.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.100]   That's what this message is.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:41.780]   That's the whole message of the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:49.420]   But remember, it is entirely something that has originated in the mind and the heart of
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.980]   God.
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:57.460]   That's the first point at which you must always start with this gospel.
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:04.020]   We are so self-centered and so self-important, and man is so important in our esteem.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:09.340]   But you see, this starts by telling us that it's all from God, in the beginning God,
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.760]   he who created, and he's been acting ever since.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.420]   This is how the apostle Paul puts it, you remember, in writing to Titus, he reminds
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:26.980]   him of it, he says, "The grace of God which bringeth salvation hath appeared, it's come."
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:32.100]   That's the message of Christianity, it's appeared, it's come, it's come in Jesus Christ.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:37.380]   The grace of God that bringeth salvation, nothing else can bring it, it's come, it
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:42.100]   has appeared in Jesus Christ.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.660]   Or if you like, I can put it like this.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.820]   The great word in the gospel is the word "gave."
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:56.260]   God so loved the world that he gave, that's grace, grace always gives.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.060]   He gave his only begotten Son.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:07.100]   He's the God who gives, the God who acts, the God who is saving his people.
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.220]   And it's all from him, it is all of grace.
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.360]   By grace he has saved, that's it, it's always grace.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.340]   Grace from beginning to end.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.500]   Now my friends, are we all clear about this?
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:24.660]   It's not in any way a response to you or to me.
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:31.780]   The glory is entirely his, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.460]   We wouldn't be here tonight if God were not a God of grace.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.740]   There wouldn't be a glimmer of hope in the gloom and the darkness of this sinful world
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.020]   tonight were it not that God is a God of grace.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.180]   You don't understand it, of course you don't, who can understand such things, we're not
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.660]   meant to understand them.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.340]   How did he do it, I don't know, but this I do know, that he has, because he's a God
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:57.300]   of grace, he's planned it all, and he sent it, and it's working out, and there is hope
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.940]   for everybody this night because of God being a God of grace.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.980]   The gospel of the grace of God.
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:14.860]   Well that's the first element, that it is what we may call self-generated grace, arising
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:20.400]   in the heart of the eternal because his name is love, that's the only explanation of it.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.660]   But let me show you how to understand that and how to grasp that, because the good way
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.340]   of looking at grace is this.
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.980]   Still more wonderful in a sense than the fact that there is a gospel at all in the world
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:40.620]   tonight, is that it is a gospel which is offered to us, offered to people like us.
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:48.060]   Not only, I say, is the gospel not a response or a reaction on the part of God to anything
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:53.740]   in us, it is the exact opposite of that.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:21:01.540]   It is God, I say, showing favor to those who don't deserve any favor at all.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.780]   No, you can't understand the doctrine of grace without understanding that particular
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.780]   element.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.080]   This is how the Apostle Paul puts it, you see, in writing to the Romans.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.580]   He says there in that first chapter where he introduces his great gospel, which is this
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:22.540]   gospel of grace always, he says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.940]   the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and also
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:32.260]   to the Greek, for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, as it
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.980]   is written, that just shall live by faith."
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.660]   There's the clarion call, "I am not ashamed of the gospel, I'm proud of it, I'm ready
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.860]   to come to Rome to preach it, I'll go anywhere to preach it, I'll lay down my life in the
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:44.860]   preaching of it."
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:45.860]   Why?
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.020]   Well, why are you so proud of it?
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:54.220]   Well, he says, the answer is this, listen, "For the wrath of God is revealed, has already
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:22:00.940]   been revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men."
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:05.700]   That's why the Apostle is thrilled with this gospel of the grace of God.
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:11.620]   The wrath of God, he says, has already been revealed.
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:17.000]   And this is where the grace of God comes in, and this is what makes this grace of God so
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.140]   amazing and astonishing.
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:25.780]   The world is under the judgment of God, it's under the wrath of God.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:31.420]   Now, whether you like that or not, that's a fact, and if you're a bit in doubt about
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.980]   it, let me ask you to look at the modern world, and there you'll see the wrath of God against
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.980]   sin.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:41.540]   That's what Paul argues, you see, in the remainder of that first chapter of the epistle
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:47.020]   to the Romans, he says God sometimes manifests his wrath against sin by just withdrawing
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.660]   his restraints, and he allows sin and evil to be rampant and to run loose and to run
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.260]   riot.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.600]   And so they begin to become moral perverts as well as being immoral, and they descend
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.140]   to any depth of filth and degradation.
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:04.880]   That's the wrath of God upon men, holding back his restraints.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:11.340]   Don't you see the wrath of God in Great Britain tonight?
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:17.300]   I was being told by a man who was a first eyewitness and has most extraordinary information
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:25.580]   about it the other night, about devil worship in this country, black magic, black mass.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:31.260]   In this country, yes, in the universities as well as amongst other people, high and
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:39.820]   low, black magic, devil worship, black mass, quite apart from all these horrible perversions
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.180]   that we are all so aware of.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:47.740]   My friends, that's a manifestation of the wrath of God upon the sin and the rebellion
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.740]   of mankind.
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:54.660]   And, of course, he's made it abundantly plain and clear, as the apostle says.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:24:00.320]   The world is under the wrath of God because men has rebelled against him.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.860]   Man has stood up against God and has defied him and has deliberately broken his commandments,
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.340]   and therefore he has come under condemnation.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:12.980]   He flouts God's holy will and God's holy laws.
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:19.700]   And the result is that man is in the hands of God and he deserves punishment, and this
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.700]   is true of everybody.
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:26.460]   Listen again to the apostle summing it all up in Romans 3, "Now we know that what thing
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:31.460]   soever the law saith, it saith to them that are under the law, that every mouth may be
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:39.240]   stopped, and all the world become guilty before God.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.860]   Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight, for by
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.800]   the law is the knowledge of sin.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.780]   But now the righteousness of God, apart from the law, is manifested, being witnessed by
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:54.220]   the law and the prophets, even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.380]   unto and upon all them that believe.
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:02.820]   For there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God."
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.540]   Now this is the fundamental postulate of biblical teaching.
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:11.100]   This is the essential preliminary to any preaching of the gospel, of the grace of God.
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.640]   It's no use just saying to people, "Come to Jesus."
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.860]   They will say, "Why should I come to Jesus?"
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.300]   That's why the messiahs are not in chapels and churches in this country tonight.
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.140]   They say, "We couldn't care less.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.940]   We don't need any help any longer."
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.560]   Why do they say that?
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.780]   Simply because they don't know that they're under the wrath of God.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.940]   They don't know God's hatred of sin.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.780]   They don't know what's awaiting them.
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:40.300]   They don't know that they're dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:45.300]   They don't know that when they die they have to stand before God in the judgment.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.620]   There's nothing more idiotic that I'm aware of than that people should say, "Fancy
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.140]   saying that in 1964.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.140]   Do people still believe that?
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.460]   What has time to do with this question?
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.660]   What's time got to do with it?
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.380]   1964.
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.380]   What's 1964?
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.460]   How does it differ from '64?
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.460]   A.D. doesn't differ at all.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:12.380]   God is God still, and is the everlasting and early and eternal God, and all your boasted
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:17.540]   and vaunted civilization and advances, they are nothing in His sight.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.180]   The nations are but like the small dust of the balance.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:26.740]   We get so excited about the nations and the groupings and the powers that be, like the
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.180]   small dust of the balance, like a drop in the bucket.
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:35.220]   The everlasting and eternal God, He looks down upon it all, and all have sinned and
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:39.060]   come short of His glory, and there is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:44.820]   And man in sin, dead in trespasses and sins, is under the wrath of God, and he deserves
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:52.740]   punishment and he will get punishment, unless, unless what?
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:57.980]   Unless he believes and accepts this gospel of the grace of God.
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.700]   See, that's what the apostles are saying.
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.020]   I'm not ashamed of it.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.020]   Why?
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.060]   Well, I'm glorying in it, and I'm ready to go anywhere and preach it.
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.740]   I'm ready to die for it if necessary.
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:12.400]   Because it's such amazing good news that a world that deserved to be damned and eternally
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:18.100]   destroyed, that God has so loved it that He's done something in grace about it.
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:22.460]   See, this is the thing that thrilled the great apostle, and that should thrill every single
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.180]   one of us.
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:30.700]   You and I cannot imagine what sin is in the sight of God.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.820]   It's utterly abhorrent to Him.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:37.620]   You and I know, don't we, what it is to feel a sense of disgust at certain things that
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.100]   we see people doing.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:44.320]   We know what it is to feel a sense of disgust with ourselves for things we've done and
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.500]   said and thought.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:52.140]   But, oh, imagine what it means in the sight of God, that holy God, that God who is light
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.140]   and in whom is no darkness at all.
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.740]   What must it mean to Him?
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.100]   Sin can't exist in His holy presence.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.860]   And He has said it's plain here, He's taught mankind through the Jews and the law which
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:07.660]   He gave to them through Moses, that He does hate it and that His nature must punish it.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.820]   He cannot refrain from punishing it.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.300]   If God didn't punish sin, He wouldn't be God.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:20.460]   He must because He's light and in Him is no darkness at all.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:24.540]   And we all deserve the punishment of hell.
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.460]   We haven't a plea, we haven't a leg to stand on.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:31.460]   There's nothing we can say for ourselves at all.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.860]   When you really examine yourself and see the meanness, the smallness, the pettiness, the
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:42.140]   uncleanness, the vileness, the rottenness, any man who knows himself knows that that's
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.460]   true of him by nature.
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:49.020]   The apostle says that about himself in me, that is to say, in my flesh dwelleth no good
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.020]   thing.
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.060]   Do you say to me I'm a respectable person?
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.060]   Respectable.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.660]   Are you?
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.540]   Could you stand up to the examination of men?
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:04.540]   Still less could you stand up to the x-ray of God's searching eye, rottenness, that which
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:10.220]   is highly esteemed amongst men is abomination in the sight of God.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:16.860]   How mad we are to pit our little understandings against the being and the character of this
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:22.940]   holy God, under whom we are and in whose presence we meet, and whoever is looking down upon
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.940]   us.
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.340]   The wrath of God.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.020]   Now, why have I said all that?
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:35.460]   I've said all that for this reason, that it is only as we have some glimmering of an
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.780]   understanding of that that we have a beginning of a glimmering of an understanding of the
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.100]   grace of God.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:50.620]   You see, this is the thing, that though that is true of us, every one of us, God so loved
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:57.740]   the world, the world that I've just been describing, that he gave his only begotten son.
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.180]   He's done it in spite of us.
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:05.540]   If he'd done it for good people, well, we'd understand it, but he's done it for us, for
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:10.580]   sinners, for rebels, for enemies, all under condemnation.
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:16.140]   Those who've rebelled against him and spat into his face and have turned away in self-righteousness
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.760]   away from him and in self-confidence, it is for such creatures that he's done it.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.820]   That's grace.
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:30.480]   Not only, I say, is it not a response to anything that goes up from us, it's all entirely in
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:37.360]   spite of us, in spite of us, entirely in spite of us, ill worthy quickened who wear dead
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.180]   in trespasses and sins.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:48.940]   By grace, as he said, God would be more than justified if he condemned us all to eternal
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:55.140]   destruction and the whole world, but the message of the gospel of the grace of God, the good
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:31:00.300]   news of the grace of God is just to say this, he hasn't done it.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:05.620]   Way before time he's worked out this plan, grace has come into operation, there is a
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:17.160]   way of escape, there is a possibility of deliverance, and it is solely and entirely due to the grace
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.220]   of God.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:23.540]   Oh what a gospel, but let's go on.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:31.260]   I found it very difficult, you know, to know what to leave out from this sermon.
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:36.580]   One really needs many hours to try to deal with this and then I'd only be beginning.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:42.580]   But I have chosen out a rather wonderful phrase that the Apostle uses about this, again in
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:48.860]   writing to those Ephesians, it's a most glowing thing this.
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:54.380]   I do hope this is coming out of what I'm trying to say very feebly this evening.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:32:00.180]   Am I giving you some impression of the glory of this gospel, the thrilling character?
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.500]   Something that moves, I mean, as it moved this mighty Apostle and made him say what
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.140]   he said to those Ephesian elders.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.900]   Listen to him then in the second chapter, again of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:16.660]   But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:22.140]   dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:26.900]   By grace he hath saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:34.220]   places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:41.980]   his grace in his kindness toward us in Jesus, through Christ Jesus.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:46.660]   Now, you don't want me to stop, do you?
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:51.120]   If you do, my friend, believe me, it's because you're blind, because you're in the darkness
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.740]   of sin, because you know nothing about the grace of God.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:59.260]   Listen, the exceeding riches of his grace.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:04.200]   The Apostle was in trouble, language was inadequate, his superlatives had been exhausted and still
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.640]   he hasn't said what he's trying to say.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.820]   What do you mean, says someone?
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:13.260]   Oh, let me just give you a glimpse or two into what he means here by the exceeding riches
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:15.040]   of this grace of God.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:19.100]   Look at it like this.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:26.260]   Look at the one who makes this salvation possible for us.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:30.340]   How has God manifested his grace?
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:34.020]   How does the grace of God save us and deliver us?
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:39.820]   And the answer is, it is in the person of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:41.860]   Grace, do you want to know anything about grace?
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:42.860]   Here it is.
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:47.780]   It's all again, you see, in John 3, 16, God so loved the world, this is the measure of
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:58.300]   his grace, that he gave, he sent into it his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, the Son of
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.300]   God.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:04.860]   Oh, you remember again, let me remind you of it, Isaac Watts' tremendous description
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.860]   of it.
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:12.940]   "See," he says, "where it shines in Jesus' face, the brightest image of his grace."
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.340]   You want to see the grace of God?
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.960]   Look into the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.080]   God in the person of his Son has all his mightiest works outdone.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:29.100]   The spacious earth and spreading flood proclaim the wise and powerful God, and thy rich glories
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:40.900]   gleam afar, glories from afar sparkle in every rolling star, but in his looks a glory
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:50.540]   stems the noblest labor of thy hands, the radiant luster of his eyes outshines the wonders
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.220]   of the skies.
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:59.140]   There's only one thing to say after that, "Grace, 'tis a sweet and charming thing.
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:06.220]   My thoughts rejoice at Jesus' name, ye angels dwell upon the sound, ye heavens reflect it
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.220]   to the ground."
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.580]   What a glory!
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:15.180]   Oh, it's the glory of the grace of God, and you see it in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:22.260]   This, my dear friends, is where you really begin to understand something about the grace
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.080]   of God.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:30.540]   In order to forgive you and me and all the world in its sin and shame, all of us who've
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:36.700]   fallen short of the glory of God, none of us is righteous.
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:37.700]   What has God done?
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:43.540]   Well, you see, he sent his only Son into the world.
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:50.000]   Sent his Son from the glory, his only begotten, his beloved Son, he sent him out of that glory
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:58.020]   down into earth to be born as a babe, to be despised of men, to be reviled and spat upon.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.020]   This is where you see grace.
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:06.100]   All this done for you and for me and people like us.
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:12.540]   But you know, he not only sent him into this world, there's something still more amazing
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:19.060]   and astonishing, and this is where you see grace.
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:26.940]   He that spared not his own Son but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:30.120]   him freely give us all things?
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:38.500]   He not only sent his Son from heaven to earth, he sent him to the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:44.300]   It wasn't men who produced the death of Christ, it was God, according to the predetermined
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.180]   counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:51.860]   He was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, that he by the
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:56.220]   grace of God might taste death for every man.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:00.580]   The grace of God not only sent him into this world to endure the contradiction of sinners
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:04.960]   against himself, it sent him to endure even unto blood.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.040]   It sent him to that cruel, ignominious death.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.820]   It laid our sins upon him.
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.580]   God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:19.820]   That's grace, God putting your sins upon him and punishing him for what you deserved.
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:24.980]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:29.900]   should not perish, they would otherwise, but have everlasting life.
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.700]   Well, that's only a glimpse.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.900]   God willing, I'll come back some future Sunday evening to deal with that a little
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.140]   bit more in detail.
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:44.420]   But there's the beginning of it all, there it all is, and then consider grace as it shows
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:47.540]   itself in the way of salvation.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:52.220]   Now, the apostle has already been reminding the Ephesian elders of this.
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.780]   He says, "You know, I want to remind you of my message."
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:01.420]   He says, "This was it, don't you remember, how I kept back nothing that was profitable
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:06.000]   unto you, but have showed you and have taught you publicly and from house to house, testifying
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.180]   both to the Jews and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.180]   Christ."
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.700]   Now, this is again the most amazing and astonishing thing.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.820]   This is where you see grace.
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.020]   How is a man saved?
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.540]   Isn't that the question?
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.140]   How can a man be just with God?
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.620]   How can I get forgiveness for my sins?
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.620]   How can I get a hope of heaven and of glory?
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:35.900]   How can I get it?
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:40.540]   You ask men that question and they'll say, "Well, you've got to pull yourself together.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:44.820]   You've got to give up doing certain things, you've got to start doing other things.
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:49.260]   You must begin reading your Bible, you must fast and sweat and pray, you must give yourself
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.260]   to doing good works.
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.260]   I've heard someone say to you, "You've even got to go out of some profession and
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:57.940]   you've got to become a monk or a hermit or an anchorite, or you've got to give up some
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:01.820]   career and go to the heart of Africa and build a hospital, and then you'll do it.
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.780]   But you see, you've got to do it, and it's a whole-time job.
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:08.460]   You've got to justify yourself by your own works and deeds and your own activities."
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:30.220]   "Oh, how I thank God that I'm in this pulpit to preach and to testify to the gospel of
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.220]   the grace of God."
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.220]   "No, no," says Paul again to those Romans, "this isn't my message.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:33.220]   Let a man justify himself.
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.220]   It can't be done.
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.220]   I'm not ashamed of the gospel."
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.220]   Why?
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.340]   By faith.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:41.740]   The thing that gave liberty to poor Martin Luther, look at that monk in his cell, fasting,
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:46.540]   sweating, praying, seeing the holiness of God more and more clearly, and his own unworthiness,
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:53.860]   and going to the point of despair, suddenly it flashed, "The just shall live by faith!"
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:58.420]   And he was released, and thousands of others were released after him.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:05.380]   The Protestant Reformation came into being, not by works, but by faith, and so, you see,
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:10.140]   the great apostle puts it like this, "Therefore, by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.060]   justified in his sight.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:16.660]   For by the law is the knowledge of sin," that's all it'll teach you, is the knowledge
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:22.140]   of sin, "but now," listen, "the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:26.420]   witnessed by the law and the prophets, even the righteousness of God, which is by faith
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:31.700]   of Jesus Christ, and to all them that believe, for there is no difference, for all have sinned
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:40.700]   and come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by his grace through the
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.900]   redemption that is in Christ Jesus."
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:49.420]   Oh, this is, of course, his perpetual theme, so he winds up a great argument in Romans
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:55.420]   3, 28, "Therefore, we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.420]   the law.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:41:01.060]   This is the grace of God," so he says again in the fourth chapter of Romans, verse 16,
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:06.300]   "Therefore, it is of faith that it might be, by grace, to the end that the promise
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.580]   might be sure to all the seed."
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:13.660]   He can't stop himself, "By grace ye are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves,
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.320]   it is the gift of God."
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:26.680]   You see, it comes to this, that as we awaken to a realization of our sinful condition,
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:32.960]   as we get to realize that we've got to meet this holy God, that none of us can do so,
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.800]   and we are aware of our hopelessness and our helplessness, and realize it's no use saying,
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.080]   "I'm going to turn over a new leaf, I'm going to be a better man," you know that you can't
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.640]   keep it up, and if you could, you couldn't undo your past, and you'd never satisfy the
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.600]   demands of an absolute, perfect, holy God.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.320]   As you realize this utter hopelessness and helplessness, and don't know what to do with
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:57.400]   yourself, nor where to turn, suddenly this message comes to you, the message of the grace
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:06.800]   of God, which tells you that your salvation is the free gift of God's grace.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:12.320]   "By grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:18.380]   God, not of works, lest any man should burst, for we are his workmanship."
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.480]   This is the most amazing thing.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:26.400]   I don't deserve anything, but here he gives it me all for nothing, without money and without
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.400]   price.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.600]   But you say, "You've got to believe."
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.480]   You have got to believe, but you know, even that's the gift of God.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.600]   "By grace are ye saved through faith, that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God."
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.360]   He gives you everything, even gives you the power to believe.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:47.520]   "For never forget this, the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:54.000]   are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, for they are spiritually discerned."
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.160]   It is all the free gift of God.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.520]   Let me hurry on.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.520]   What does he give us?
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.200]   Well, these are some of the things he gives us, and this is, you see, why this apostle
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:07.720]   says, "I'm going on to testify to this gospel of the grace of God until my course is ended.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:11.080]   Whether I be put to death or not, it doesn't make any difference to me at all.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.720]   I just want to tell the whole world about this grace of God."
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.720]   What does it give?
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:24.280]   Pardon and forgiveness, free and full, reconciliation to God, your sins blotted out as a thick cloud.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:28.920]   "Though they be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow."
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:34.880]   That's the message, that it doesn't matter how much you've sinned, nor how grievously
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.800]   you've sinned, nor how vilely you have sinned.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.120]   It doesn't matter at all.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:45.960]   You come just as you are and believe this message, you are forgiven freely and entirely.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.160]   There's nothing left of your sin.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.440]   You are reconciled to God.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:54.080]   But you see, it goes beyond that.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.800]   "Justification by faith," says the apostle.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.800]   What does that mean?
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:05.360]   Well, it means this, of course, that God not only forgives us, he puts the righteousness
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.560]   of his Son upon us.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.520]   Now, this is very wonderful to me.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.520]   I need forgiveness.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.880]   That's the first thing I'm aware of, and I want forgiveness.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:17.200]   But the moment I realize that I'm forgiven, I then begin to realize very acutely that
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.440]   I need something else.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:28.660]   If God merely forgave me, I don't know what I'd do with myself.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:32.120]   Because how could I stand in the presence of God?
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:36.640]   And especially since he's forgiven me so freely in his grace, but I do want to stand
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.640]   in his presence.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:38.640]   I want to speak to him.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.640]   I want to know him.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.560]   I want to spend my eternity with him.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:42.560]   How can I?
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.560]   I'm forgiven, you say.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:47.680]   Yes, but, oh, I'm so rotten still in my own nature.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:48.680]   What can I do?
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:54.600]   Well, the answer is what's called "justification by faith," which means this, that God puts
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.960]   upon you the righteousness of his own Son.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.960]   He's put your sins onto him.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:06.140]   He now takes his perfect righteousness and puts it on you, and it's often been compared
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.140]   to a cloak.
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:12.320]   You remember that great hymn of Count Zinzendorf, translated by John Wesley, "Jesus, thy blood
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.080]   and righteousness, my beauty are, my glorious dress.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:20.680]   'Midst flaming worlds in this arrayed, with joy shall I lift up my head.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.580]   Nobody can bring a charge against me.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:29.680]   When I am clothed with the righteousness of Jesus Christ, bold shall I stand in thy great
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.360]   day.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:39.320]   Nothing can stand between me, because I am clothed with the righteousness of Jesus Christ."
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:44.980]   Like the father put the robe on the prodigal and the ring on his finger, God puts the righteousness
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:46.680]   of his own Son upon us.
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:51.580]   He gives us this freely, justified freely by his grace.
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:56.060]   And that gives you, you see, peace with God.
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:01.640]   Not only that, he'll give you a new start, a new nature, what we call "regeneration,"
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.040]   new birth, if you like.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.680]   Oh, these are all great mysteries.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.380]   I'm going to come back to these.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.200]   I'm only giving you a summary of it all this evening.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.640]   Then the gift of the Spirit, the Holy Spirit.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:18.580]   The Spirit will be working within you, sanctifying you, giving you power and strength and fitting
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.380]   you, and working upon you.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:24.740]   You see, when God forgives you and saves you with this grace of his in salvation, he doesn't
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:30.360]   just leave you to yourselves to struggle on as best you can in this world.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:35.520]   He says, "No, no, no, brethren, I commend you to God and the word of his grace, which
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:43.000]   is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified."
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.380]   He goes on working in you, purifying you, giving you strength and power, bringing Christ
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:53.100]   near to you, giving you a realization of his presence so that you can say, "I need thee
[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.100]   every hour.
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.100]   Stay thou nearby.
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:59.980]   Temptations lose their power when thou art nigh.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:03.080]   I fear no foe with thee at hand to bless."
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.780]   Here it is.
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:05.780]   What else?
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:06.780]   Access to God.
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:11.460]   Listen to Paul again, "Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:20.620]   Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand."
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:27.300]   That really means that I am enabled to go into the presence of God and talk to him as
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.300]   my Father.
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:29.300]   I can pray.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:33.020]   I am not left to myself, and I am not filled with doubts when I get on my knees.
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.860]   I know that God is my Father.
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:36.100]   I have got access to him.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.860]   I can go into his very presence.
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:42.860]   I can go into the holiest of all, by the blood of Jesus.
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:55.700]   Oh, but above everything else, I am put into Christ, and Christ is in me, and in him there
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.620]   are unsearchable riches.
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.620]   He is the head.
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:06.700]   I am a part of his body, and all the fullness of that head can come flowing, even unto me,
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.140]   insignificant little member as I seem to be.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:15.300]   Oh, but of his unsearchable riches, it all comes flowing through, circulating in the
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:20.700]   body, and I am a part of that body, the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:26.620]   This is where you begin to understand the exceeding riches of God's grace.
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:31.180]   So you see, these poets, they vie with one another in trying to describe it.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.180]   What have I got?
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:38.260]   Well, it says, "One sight, riches, healing of the mind, yea, all I need in thee to find.
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.340]   O Lamb of God, I come."
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:47.300]   "Why," says the Apostle Peter, "God hath given you a like precious faith with us, and as
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:53.260]   the result of this, all things that pertain to life and godliness have already been given
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.260]   us."
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:49:01.720]   We have got exceeding great and precious promises to cover the whole of our eternal future.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.460]   The exceeding riches of his grace.
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.180]   Let me give you a final thought.
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.980]   The reign and the triumph of grace.
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.700]   Here again is a great theme in the Scriptures.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:17.220]   The Apostle, I have already read you one verse, Romans 4, 16, "Therefore it is of faith that
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:24.860]   it might be by grace to the end that the promise might be sure to all the seed."
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:27.180]   Grace guarantees that it's sure.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.540]   Did you know this, my friend?
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:34.860]   If your salvation and mine depended even to the smallest extent upon us, we would all
[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:38.060]   lose it and we'd all fail.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:45.420]   But because it is by grace, it's made sure to all the seed.
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:51.340]   Or take another way in which he puts it in Romans 5, 20 and 21, "Moreover, the law entered
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:57.540]   he says that the offence might abound, but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound."
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:59.260]   You see, there's a great fight going on.
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:04.580]   The power of sin, the reign of sin, and the reign of grace, these are the great antagonists,
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:05.580]   it's all right, says Paul.
[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:10.220]   "The law has added to sin and has multiplied it, but where sin abounded, grace did much
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:19.260]   more abound, that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:25.700]   unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:29.200]   These are the things in which he therefore glories.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:34.340]   He tells these Romans again in the 6th chapter in verse 14, "Sin shall not have dominion
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.340]   over you."
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:36.340]   Why?
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:43.700]   "Not under law, but under grace, conquering grace, mighty grace, grace that can never
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:44.700]   fail."
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:45.700]   Listen to this.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:49.540]   This is perhaps the grandest statement of it all in the 8th chapter of the epistle to
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:50.540]   the Romans.
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:56.260]   Listen to this mighty sequence, this logic, this inevitability, this grace of God guaranteeing
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.260]   everything.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:01.140]   "We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:03.900]   the called according to his purpose.
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:07.660]   Moreover whom he did foreknow, he also did predestine it to be conformed to the image
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:11.540]   of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:18.700]   Moreover whom he did predestine it, whom he called, whom he justified, whom he also glorified."
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.700]   What does it mean?
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:25.020]   Oh, it means this, that the great God is putting into practice his eternal plan and scheme
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:28.460]   and its grace, and it is determined to carry it right through.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.900]   If he has looked upon you, if he has set his heart upon you, if he has called you, he will
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:35.700]   glorify you, and nothing can stop it.
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:45.660]   "Therefore," he ends by saying, "I am persuaded, I am absolutely certain, that neither death
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:51.940]   nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:58.580]   to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:02.660]   the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:07.580]   Grace triumphant, grace victorious, grace carrying it through to the end, he which hath
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:12.780]   begun a good work in you shall perform it until the day of Jesus Christ, and nothing
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:13.780]   can stop him.
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.940]   His kingdom cannot fail.
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:18.500]   He rules over earth and heaven.
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:22.500]   The keys of death and hell are to our Jesus given."
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:25.660]   Lift up your hearts, lift up your voice.
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:29.020]   Rejoice, again I say.
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.020]   Rejoice.
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:37.580]   Well, there, my dear friends, is a very brief and inadequate summary of the main outline
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:42.140]   of this gospel of the grace of God.
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:45.980]   Have you realized all this?
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:50.820]   If not, why not, I ask?
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:55.300]   Have you realized that this is the gospel?
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:53:00.060]   If not, it is probably because you have never seen your need of it.
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:04.300]   You have been so interested in living in this world and general elections and things like
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:08.500]   that that you have forgotten that you are a mortal soul, that you have got to die and
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:09.980]   face God in the judgment.
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.980]   You have not realized the truth about yourself.
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:13.740]   You are living in a fool's paradise.
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:17.740]   You have not realized that the wrath of God is upon you and may descend upon you at any
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:18.740]   moment.
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:26.100]   You have not realized your condemnation, your helplessness, your hopelessness.
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:32.060]   Or perhaps it is that you have never seen the glory of what God has done in his grace.
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:41.260]   Or it may be that you have not realized that it is an entire gift, free gift of God's grace.
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.300]   You may still be thinking, "I have got to do something.
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.980]   I surely must make myself a little bit better."
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:51.220]   Listen to the answer, "Let not conscience make you linger or of fitness fondly dream.
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:54.620]   All the fitness he requireth is to see your need of him.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:58.140]   This even that the Spirit gives you."
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.140]   This he gives you.
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:07.700]   It is the Spirit's rising being.
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:11.660]   What are we going to say?
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:19.220]   Have you seen something of this grace of God, the gospel of the grace of God?
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:25.940]   Do you begin to understand why the great Apostle felt as he did, that he'd sooner die than
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:31.580]   stop preaching this, that no enemy could ever put an end to him and his preaching, that
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:35.740]   it didn't matter what kings and princes and emperors of Rome, didn't matter what they
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.500]   said nor what they may try to do.
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:42.000]   He must testify to this gospel of the grace of God.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.340]   Look what it had done to him.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:44.980]   Look at the difference it had made to him.
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:47.260]   Look at the glory it was opening out before him.
[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:49.380]   He says in effect, "Let them put me to death."
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:50.380]   What is death?
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:51.740]   Well, to me, to die is gain.
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:56.380]   It is to be with Christ, which is far better.
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:03.820]   And so he glories in the gospel of the grace of God.
[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:08.580]   George Wesley, you see, felt exactly the same thing.
[00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:14.900]   That's why he wrote that first hymn we sang tonight, "Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:23.060]   my great Redeemer's praise, the glories of my God and King," listen, "the triumphs, the
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:29.160]   triumphs of his grace."
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:32.540]   He breaks the power of canceled sin.
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.840]   He sets the prisoner free.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:39.280]   The triumphs of his grace, you'll find a lot of them in the New Testament.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:45.600]   Publicans and sinners, people like the Philippian jailer, hopeless, suddenly set free, triumphs
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:51.000]   of his grace, the saints of the ages, the dissolute, brilliant, immoral philosopher
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:57.400]   Augustine, unable to set himself free with all his philosophy, set free by the triumphs
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:08.120]   of his grace, and all the countless hosts of sinners of every description who have likewise
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:13.640]   known the liberating power of the gospel of the grace of God.
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:19.120]   I want to end with a way in which Samuel Davis puts it.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:27.360]   I like the way he puts it, "Great God of wonders, all thy ways are godlike, matchless,
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:40.520]   and divine, but the fair glories of thy grace, more godlike and unrivaled shine.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:53.520]   Who is a pardoning God like thee, or who has grace so rich and free?"
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:57:00.320]   Let us then sing that great hymn of Samuel Davis, hymn number 67, "Great God of wonders,
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:10.000]   all thy ways are godlike, matchless, and divine, but the fair glories of thy grace, more godlike
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:28.600]   and unrivaled shine," 67.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.600]   [Music]
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:49.560]   "Great God of wonders, all thy ways are godlike, matchless, and divine, but the fair glories
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:59.800]   of thy grace, more godlike and unrivaled shine.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:18.520]   Who is a pardoning God like thee, or who has grace so rich and free?
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:34.200]   The joy of angels through the years that hear the angel voices.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:52.160]   Great is thy grace, dear Father, dear, and once again beyond compare, your grace, our
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:59:01.360]   pardoning God, like thee."
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:05.280]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
