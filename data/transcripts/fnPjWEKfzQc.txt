[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   I would like to see us fulfill the dream of the early to mid-20th century and build a mile-high
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.160]   skyscraper. This was what people saw the development of skyscrapers going in the
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.600]   30s and 40s and perhaps 50s. Frank Lloyd Wright designed this mile-high skyscraper called the
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.240]   Illinois, presumably back when Chicago was a metro of rising importance.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.040]   The technology for it exists and you haven't really seen anyone do it. Even these people
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.720]   who are willing to clearly build these giant white elephant projects, basically nobody has
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.360]   tried to go the distance and build a mile-high skyscraper. I would like to see us do it.
