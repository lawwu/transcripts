[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.920]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.320]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.320]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.320]   I am your host.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.040]   Today, we're going to talk about how stocks always go up.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.960]   Radical Personal Finance listener Benjamin writes in the Radical Personal Finance Facebook
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.960]   group.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.840]   A few months back, Joshua stated something along the lines of, quote, "If the Fed and
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.480]   Congress can dump an insane amount of money and save this sinking ship one last time,
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.080]   that would be awesome.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.560]   It would also mean I would triple down on my bet against the future of XYZ."
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.840]   That seemed to have happened.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.320]   I don't see how it's at all sustainable and actually reflects the real economic state
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.600]   the United States is in, but the market is indeed at an all-time high, again, despite
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.200]   the apparent dismal economic future that looms.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.680]   I took a strong cash position in late March.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.320]   It seemed wise at the time.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.920]   Six months later, I personally know many people who are out of work, whose companies in the
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.080]   corporate event space have completely collapsed, yet the market carries onward and upward,
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.360]   as if the realities of many of my colleagues have absolutely no bearing on the economic
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.360]   state.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.560]   No regrets, no grudges.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.680]   My family's social wealth and mental health are higher than ever.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.560]   This post is a small challenge to Radical Personal Finance to address this fact.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.400]   The bet on the U.S. stock market feels like it is an almost guaranteed bet at this point,
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.200]   based on what the Fed has done.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.520]   What do you do with this information, knowing that it is not sustainable?
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.200]   As for me, I will continue to bet on me.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.080]   I'll continue to increase my flows of income, double down on my time investments in Toastmasters,
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.080]   et cetera.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.960]   I thought this was a very, let's dust off a $10 word, perspicacious question that was
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.160]   worth addressing, and I want to do so in today's show.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.680]   I think that Benjamin is exactly right.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.120]   I don't remember exactly what the quote was that I said.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.640]   I didn't go back and look for it.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.640]   I'll assume that Benjamin is right, that I said, "If the Fed and Congress can dump an
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.320]   insane amount of money and save this sinking ship one last time, that would be awesome.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.120]   It would also mean I would triple down on my bet against the future of XYZ."
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.840]   And so I'm just going to assume that that's what I said.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.360]   It sounds like something that I would say, and I believe that he probably quoted me accurately
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.400]   there.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.600]   But what I want to point out is that Benjamin's planning worked.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.880]   And my ambition is not to make the world's most accurate prognostications on the future
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.800]   direction of stocks.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:19.080]   My ambition is to see to the security, the financial security, the comfort, the loving,
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.120]   safe environment of my family through all circumstances and through all situations.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.320]   And I think that it'll help if I talk about this reality that seems like stocks always
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.080]   go up, that seems like stocks have gone up quickly, massive recoveries very, very quickly.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:43.160]   We'll talk briefly about that, but I want to emphasize that that conversation is not
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.680]   the center of focus for most of us.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.240]   I have tried during my career here at Radical Personal Finance to communicate in a thoughtful
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.400]   way, but to be willing to articulate nuance.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.480]   What I've learned is that nuance doesn't translate particularly well to public commentary.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.440]   I've learned that no matter how hard I try to be precise with my words, thoughtful in
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.360]   my delivery, no matter that I try to be broad in my discussion of various scenarios and
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.720]   the factors that could go into them, I'm continually confronted by the fact that many people don't
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.520]   hear nuance well.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.880]   And I find that a little frustrating, but it's just a fact of life, right?
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.600]   There are many people who don't hear humor well.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.200]   There are many people who don't do many things well.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.080]   And sometimes I hear my words repeated back to me as though this is what Joshua believes,
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.120]   and I think, "But I don't believe that."
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.560]   And I've learned this throughout my life.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.760]   And I've tried to compensate it by explaining things more clearly, but ironically, that
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.960]   ends up backfiring.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.040]   You take more time to say something clearly, and then fewer people tune in for the entirety
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.560]   of it, and then it just doesn't work.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:03.640]   A while ago, I was reading a discussion about me in an online personal finance forum, and
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.400]   somebody was asking the question, "Has anybody listened to Joshua Sheets and Radical Personal
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.400]   Finance?"
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.000]   I noticed it, of course, and I poked my head in.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.960]   And some people said, "Yes," some people said, "No."
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.640]   They've gone back and forth about what they like, what they don't like, blah, blah, blah.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.680]   But one guy popped in and he said, "Is that the guy who's always talking about buying
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.360]   gold and moving to a no-income tax state?"
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.480]   And I chuckled to myself because I thought, "Well, I guess I'm probably more friendly
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.600]   towards the ownership of gold than what I would say the majority of mainstream financial
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.040]   advisors are, but I don't think of myself as a gold bug, and I'm trying to think of
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.040]   any...
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.440]   I don't know that I've ever actually done an entire show on buying gold, but I guess
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.600]   this is the reputation that this guy has of me or that I have with this guy."
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.160]   And then moving to a no-income tax state, yeah, I've advocated for that and did a whole
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.120]   show on it, but I don't hammer everyone.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.720]   And I thought, "This is what comes through?"
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.800]   Now, it's totally fine, right?
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.200]   We all have freedom to absorb our own perspectives and it's my job to try to be a good communicator.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.920]   But what I've learned is that nuance often doesn't come through.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:21.360]   And I want to focus on what I think does work for financial planning because as concerned
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.240]   as I get at times about many things and as clearly as I try to warn about things that
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.000]   I think are real legitimate threats to your lifestyle, to your wealth, et cetera, I don't
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.200]   think of myself as much of an extremist.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.360]   And I don't actually think that the extremist viewpoint is the best viewpoint.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:49.320]   You know, as an example, right about the time that I would have said that quote, I was asked
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.160]   by one of my relatives, an elderly lady who's one of my relatives, who reached out to me
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.240]   for some financial advice right in the middle.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:03.280]   And this was when everything was uncertain, the stock market was dumping off massive numbers
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.100]   very, very quickly, the world was just shutting down.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.560]   This would have been a back and about, I guess, March, and everything looked black on every
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.960]   side.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.680]   And my relative, my aunt, one of my aunts, my aunt reached out to me and said, "Joshua,
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.160]   I'd like to talk to you about what I should do with my money."
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.980]   And I said, "Sure, I'd be happy to."
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:29.800]   And through the context of that conversation, she was considering whether or not she should
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.000]   get out of the market, whether she should sell her mutual funds and get out, and she
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.760]   has a financial advisor.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.280]   And I walked through it with her.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:43.280]   And my end result, end advice, after reviewing her situation, my advice to her was, "No,
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.120]   you shouldn't sell anything, you should just sit tight."
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:53.200]   Now I'll explain in a minute why I got there, but I didn't say to her that she's just got
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.800]   to get out, everything's going to fall apart and the market's going down and you got to
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.320]   get out, you got to get out, you got to get out.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.620]   I didn't do that.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:07.080]   And the reason I didn't do it is what I'm going to articulate in this show, namely,
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:15.080]   that good financial planning is done for personal reasons and to some extent, possibly even
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:26.100]   to a great extent, can ignore the markets.
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.480]   I think that if you grasp that and implement it, it can help you to sleep well at night,
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:39.640]   it can help you to make wiser financial decisions and to be more confident in your decisions.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.600]   I do not know how to predict the future of the stock market.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:52.880]   I am baffled, genuinely baffled by much of what the reality is that is reflected in the
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.260]   stock markets.
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.160]   And that probably shouldn't be a surprise.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:07.600]   After all, we use the term stock market, but it actually doesn't exist in the sense that
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.580]   the stock market is not one thing.
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:17.360]   We use the term to refer to the buying and selling of securities, buying and selling
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.880]   of shares of ownership in companies.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:28.700]   But what the stock market reflects is simply the individual's decisions of hundreds of
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:33.360]   millions of people on a global basis.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.800]   And to think that you can accurately predict on a broad basis the individual decisions
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.240]   of hundreds of millions of people, to me, seems futile from the start.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.860]   I mean, just think about this.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:54.080]   Think about the amount of work that goes into the business of predicting the actions of
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.100]   anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands to millions to, in some cases, tens of millions
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:09.100]   of people over something as finite and binary as a political election.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.460]   Think about it.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.460]   Think about right now.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:16.060]   The presidential election in the United States is coming up in a couple of months.
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.020]   Who's going to win?
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.800]   President Trump or Joe Biden?
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.100]   Who's going to win?
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.960]   You have a simple binary decision, right?
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.940]   One of those two men will win.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.060]   And yet how difficult is that to predict?
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:38.540]   Now how much more difficult is it to predict whether an individual company's value will
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.520]   go up or an individual company's value will go down?
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:48.920]   And then how much more difficult is it to predict that the net results of hundreds and
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:55.180]   hundreds, in many cases thousands of companies on a global basis, all of who are in different
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.180]   markets?
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.700]   That's a very, very difficult thing to do.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.180]   I don't believe it's impossible.
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:05.060]   I believe that you can find one corner of the market that you know well.
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.860]   You can choose a handful of companies that you follow closely.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.340]   You can develop a trading strategy.
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:16.860]   You can study something and make some guesses to some degree of accuracy.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:24.540]   But the idea that any of us normal people could speak accurately about the stock market
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.100]   is very hard to believe.
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.660]   It's a very difficult task.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:34.580]   But you don't have to speak accurately about the stock market if you'll do good financial
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.780]   planning.
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.780]   So back to Benjamin's question.
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:45.780]   What I would point out is that Benjamin did the right thing.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.300]   How do I know he did the right thing?
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.780]   Because he said, "I'm happy with it.
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.100]   No regrets, no grudges."
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.100]   What did he do?
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.260]   He said, "I took a strong cash position in late March."
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.420]   I don't know what that means.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.740]   I don't know if he sold stocks, if he didn't sell stocks.
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:11:59.740]   Who knows what that means.
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.140]   Maybe he just started saving more money.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.340]   But he took a strong cash position and it seemed wise at the time.
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.660]   I would say it was wise at the time.
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:14.420]   I advocated very loudly for you to take a strong cash position, to be conservative,
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.180]   to be thoughtful, to be defensive.
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.580]   I said that you should keep cash reserves on hand.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:26.060]   I even said you should keep physical currency reserves on hand.
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:29.180]   And I don't regret any of that commentary.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.380]   In my opinion, that was the wise and prudent thing to do.
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:39.860]   Thankfully, we have thus far, and I think on this particular scenario, we have avoided
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.580]   all of the worst case scenarios.
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.140]   All of the worst case scenarios have been avoided.
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:52.060]   There have been a number of cities in Spain and in Italy, maybe New York City, where the
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:56.700]   hospital started to get full, but the worst case scenarios didn't exist in this particular
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.820]   pandemic.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:04.940]   But it was still wise and prudent of you to be thoughtful and to be careful.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.940]   And I think one of the things that would make my commentary different than some other people
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:16.720]   is I believe that the prudent approach, I believe the smart approach, prudent brings
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.900]   with it a value judgment.
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.020]   I just think it's just flat out smart.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:27.620]   The prudent, there I go with it again, prudent and smart approach to danger and to risk is
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:35.460]   to react quickly, and I say it's even logical to overreact early.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.220]   Give you, I guess, an example, okay?
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.940]   The mask debate.
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:45.460]   At this point in time, I am totally comfortable going anywhere in the world without a mask,
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.580]   at this point in time, knowing what I know about coronavirus.
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.620]   This point in time, I don't have much fear of getting the disease.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:59.700]   I assume that at some point I'll probably get it, and so I don't intend to get a vaccine
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.700]   for it.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.660]   I'd rather get the disease and deal with that than deal with the vaccine, at least the way
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.540]   things look right now, at least the way that the data that is available at now.
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.300]   Of course, I reserve my right to change my mind.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.500]   I figure that this particular strain of coronavirus is going to be with us for a long time.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.500]   It's infected the whole world.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.180]   I'll probably get coronavirus at some point in time.
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.180]   I don't want to.
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.180]   I'm not going to go out of my way.
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.500]   I've got a friend of mine who's got coronavirus right now.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.660]   I'm not going to his house to try to have a coronavirus party to get the disease and
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:37.500]   get it out of the way with, but I'm not concerned about it at this point in time due to my medical
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.740]   profile and due to my family, et cetera.
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.140]   I figure I'll probably get it at some point in time.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.140]   I don't want to get sick.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.940]   I figure I probably will.
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.700]   So I'm totally comfortable with the concept and the thought of getting coronavirus right
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.820]   now, totally comfortable with the idea of going around without a mask on.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.740]   Okay, I get it.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.420]   That happens.
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.060]   I was not comfortable with that in March.
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.780]   In March, I wasn't going anywhere.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:11.100]   In March, if I did leave my house, I was very thoroughly masked up with a mask, a face shield,
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.100]   et cetera.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:17.300]   I was very stringent and careful about my decision making, minimized exposure, didn't
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.440]   go to anything indoors that could be expected.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.660]   I was very, very careful in March.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:30.580]   And given the chance, I'd do exactly the same thing again because the data wasn't available.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.060]   The data was too confusing.
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.900]   The data was too strange.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:38.420]   You had lies from the Chinese government.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.740]   You had coverups.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.780]   You had suppression of information.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.820]   You couldn't get a straight answer from anybody on anything.
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.740]   You had extreme positions that didn't seem to be well-founded.
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.300]   You had some people predicting the death of hundreds of millions of people.
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.180]   You had some people saying, "Oh, it's nothing."
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:02.060]   It was not possible at that point in time to make a really well-informed decision, in
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.260]   my opinion.
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.900]   I could not understand why.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.420]   Back in the—I don't know if you guys remember this with all the mask debates going on globally,
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:16.740]   but I was wearing a mask everywhere in March, and when I left once every couple of weeks
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:23.100]   to go to the store, I was wearing a mask everywhere when the CDC in the United States was advising
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.100]   against mask wearing.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:30.180]   And Dr. Anthony Fauci was in public saying, "You should not wear masks.
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.180]   Masks don't do any good."
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.080]   I thought, "That's crazy.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.020]   Masks might not ultimately do any good, but they'd probably do something.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.020]   It just makes sense that they would probably do something."
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.620]   And of course, we find out, as was expected, it was a lie.
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:48.820]   It was a knowledgeable misleading of the public because the government overlords decided that
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:53.980]   they were the ones who were going to be thoughtful and careful with the information to manipulate
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:54.980]   the public to their will.
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:55.980]   It's stupid.
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.460]   Why you never believe government people when they say anything?
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.800]   They have to lie.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.700]   They have to lie because they believe it's the morally right thing to lie.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.740]   And so you should just always assume that all government representatives are lying because
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.300]   they believe that lying is the morally right thing to do.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:17.340]   So forgive me, I didn't mean to engage in so much hyperbole there.
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.940]   It's not hyperbole.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.860]   I didn't mean to become so emotional.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:28.340]   The point was that the data at that point in time was not clear, was not available.
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:36.280]   And so what do you do when you have a potentially significant risk?
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.960]   You protect against it.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.800]   You stockpile cash.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:47.520]   With my business owner clients, private clients that I work with, I advocated very hardcore
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.920]   protection.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.880]   You have to wait and see what works out.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.600]   And some clients said, "Okay, we think this business is going to be okay, but it may not
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.960]   be."
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.120]   And across the board, though you might be doing fine, there are lots of other people
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.240]   who are not.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.960]   And though you might not be doing fine, there are lots of other people who are doing totally
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.960]   fine.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.000]   The data wasn't available.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.600]   So the intelligent approach was overreact early and then adjust as needed.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:20.960]   I lean on hurricane metaphors because it's the best example that I know of, of dealing
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.960]   with risk.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.400]   It's something that being a native Floridian, I'm intimately familiar with.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.960]   Hurricanes are very serious threats.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.840]   They claim lives every year.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.040]   They destroy millions of dollars of property every single year.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.960]   But they are notoriously fickle threats.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.160]   They're very hard to predict, although we're much better at predicting them than we once
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.920]   were, but they're still notoriously difficult to predict.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.680]   And even to the last minute, you don't know whether one is going to hit you.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.320]   And so you have a choice to make.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.960]   The choice is, am I going to be the kind of person who prepares for hurricanes or am I
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.280]   going to be the kind of person who doesn't?
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:06.360]   There are millions of people along the coastlines of the Carolinas and Florida and Texas and
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.040]   Louisiana who don't prepare for hurricanes.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.740]   They don't have a flashlight in their house.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:16.120]   They don't have plywood for their windows or shutters or anything.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.360]   And there are millions of people who will go their entire life and never be negatively
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.560]   impacted by a hurricane.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.720]   And so they look at it and say, "Ha, look, I didn't need to do anything because I've
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.600]   never been impacted by a hurricane."
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:35.180]   On the other hand, many of us will eventually be impacted by a hurricane and your experience
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:40.900]   of the hurricane will be dramatically different based upon the amount of forethought that
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.720]   you've put into the situation.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.340]   Use a few examples.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:52.520]   When a hurricane is predicted for your area, ideally you should have almost nothing to
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:57.380]   do except possibly top off the car's gas tanks.
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.920]   The hurricane lines in stores are terrible.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.040]   Oftentimes you can't get what you want.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.960]   Thankfully, just like with a lot of financial risks and pandemic risks, et cetera, it's
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.920]   a lot better now than it was 20 years ago.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:18.440]   I am so impressed these days by grocery stores and their ability to handle major disasters.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.320]   It is awesome what they're able to do.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:29.240]   Companies like HEB or Publix or Costco or Sam's Club, it is incredible to see how good
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:35.280]   their supply chain managers are at redirecting supplies and quickly getting the appropriate
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.140]   supplies to a place that's in need.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.220]   It is awesome.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.360]   I have tremendous concerns about just-in-time inventory management.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.240]   I think it's a major threat to your life.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:52.760]   I am amazed at how good we are now, those stores are, at supplying needs.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.940]   But even so, going last-minute hurricane shopping is a pain.
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.520]   If you're going to do things like board up your house, going out at the last minute trying
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.440]   to get plywood at Home Depot is a real pain.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.700]   It stinks.
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.520]   I don't think that's any way to live.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.840]   I think the proper thing to do if you're going to live in hurricane country is buy a house
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.880]   that's well-built.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.120]   If you can afford to, then you go ahead and just buy a house that's built for hurricanes.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.960]   The house is hurricane rated, everything is properly done.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.040]   You buy a house that has storm windows so you don't even have to cover the windows.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:32.720]   Then you make sure you keep all the time proper supplies in the home, store of water, battery
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.360]   system for electrical power, generator, fuel storage, etc.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.840]   You keep a standard maintenance contract with your yard maintenance crew to keep the yard
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.840]   trimmed.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.120]   Then if a hurricane is coming your way, maybe you spend an hour or so going out on the back
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.880]   deck, bringing in your deck chairs, putting them in the garage, putting up the braces
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.740]   on the garage door for the wind load.
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.600]   It's pretty simple, not that big a deal.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.960]   Now maybe you can't do that, so you go ahead and buy shutters.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.360]   Those people who buy shutters in advance can be prudent.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   If the hurricane is coming their way, they just go ahead and close the shutters.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.140]   Takes 15 minutes, you go around the house, slide close the accordion shutters, lock them
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.140]   all up, you're done.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.140]   I have some friends that do this, it's great.
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.840]   Go to the house, 15 minutes, the shutters are all closed.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.780]   You don't even have to think about should I close the shutters.
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:20.520]   It's not as crazy, should I go to the store and get plywood.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.880]   Some people buy the shutters that take a lot of work.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.760]   They're more likely to procrastinate.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.620]   So they wait and then they go out at the last minute, put up the panels, take several hours,
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.040]   but at least that's better than plywood.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:36.300]   And so your goal and your ambition living in hurricane country should be that about
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.280]   the only thing you need to do when there's actually a hurricane watch issued for your
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:45.480]   county is fill up your gas tank.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.320]   Life is easy when you take those preparations.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.980]   Now not everybody can do that, certainly.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:55.840]   Not everybody can live in that kind of house, not everybody can afford the bill for the
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.040]   hurricane shutters.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:02.200]   That's not a prudent use of money for some people, but it's really great to live like
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.420]   that way, life that way.
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:09.160]   And so from the perspective of financial planning, preparing for a disaster should be the same
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.220]   thing.
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.540]   There should never be a need to freak out because the market's dropping and here's this
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.540]   big new thing.
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.740]   There should never be a need to do that.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.020]   Most of us, of course, we don't keep six months of rice and beans in our house.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.260]   Most of us don't.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.160]   And so you say, you know what, I'm going to go ahead and get a couple extra months of
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.860]   rice and beans or whatever your version of that is.
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:36.620]   But the goal, the idea, the ideal is to live a prepared lifestyle.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:41.700]   The goal is to have your portfolio values squared away because you know they're right
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:46.860]   if times get tough or if they don't, if they're not tough, in good markets and in down markets.
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:52.380]   Now if your strategy involves you specifically taking advantage of some buys, maybe you have
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.980]   a buy list, you have some companies that you're watching, you've done, maybe you're a value
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.400]   investor and you've done a valuation and you see markets are dropping, then you just go
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.500]   to your buy list and you say, here are some companies that I think are worth a lot of
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.500]   money.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.860]   Oh, these are good prices.
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.820]   Let me start buying.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.340]   On the other hand, maybe you find yourself caught unaware.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:15.060]   You're usually sitting on a large stockpile of cash.
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:20.700]   You're usually well insulated, well insured, but you recently stretched to make a new investment
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:25.460]   and all of a sudden you find yourself with less cash and the storm clouds are gathering.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.800]   You might need to just go ahead and divert money to cash for a little bit of time.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.660]   But in a properly run life, in a properly run financial life, those variations should
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.080]   be modest.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.240]   I took cash out of the bank, extra cash out of the bank back in March because I was concerned
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.360]   about the ability to get cash.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.880]   I was concerned about bank runs.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.400]   I didn't predict the national coin shortage.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:54.560]   That's weird, but I was concerned about the ability to get cash out of the bank.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.160]   I would have been fine if I'd never taken cash out of the bank because I always keep
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.520]   cash on hand.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.120]   I'm proud of the fact that I said you should get cash out of the bank and I got some listeners
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:09.640]   to go and get $3,000 or $5,000 or $10,000 because that's prudent planning for all times.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.840]   Same things.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:22.400]   What I want you to focus on is you should be well prepared for situations at all times.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:29.000]   It's not a bad idea to use the emotion of an impending event, that sense of dread that
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.680]   you have, to go ahead and do what you know you need to do.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:38.440]   I remember a number of years ago, I knew I needed to store more fuel.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.200]   I knew I needed to buy a battery and an inverter for my hurricane plans.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.760]   I didn't do it.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.480]   You always feel like, "I don't need to go do this right now.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.600]   I don't really want to go and spend all this money right now."
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.800]   Then the hurricane came.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.920]   Okay, I'll go do it.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:26:01.080]   I went ahead, stocked up on the fuel, purchased the battery and the inverter and got it done.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.140]   You can use the fear of the moment.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:08.280]   If this caused you to recognize that you should keep an emergency fund on hand, great.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:14.040]   You should use the fear of the moment to get you to do what you know you need to do.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:19.760]   And then when the worst case scenario doesn't happen, as long as you were thoughtful and
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:24.920]   prudent and you didn't overreact in a stupid way.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.640]   I'm okay with overreaction, but not stupid overreaction.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.240]   As long as you were prudent and you didn't do anything you would regret, you have no
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.240]   worries.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.400]   You have nothing to fear about.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.240]   That's the philosophy that I hold to.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.040]   I believe that it's logically correct.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.040]   I believe that it's emotionally correct.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.280]   I believe that it leads to a peaceful life.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:55.520]   I don't regret having a lot of cash because it allows me to feel totally at rest and totally
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.520]   at peace.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:01.680]   That's what Benjamin mentioned.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.680]   Can you put a price tag on it?
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.600]   Yeah, you can compare what would my portfolio values be if that cash were invested versus
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.720]   what would my emotions be.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.560]   I don't regret it myself.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.800]   If you regret it, then make a different choice.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.480]   Now let's talk about the stock market.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.480]   What did I get wrong?
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.560]   What did you get wrong?
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.560]   I don't know.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.860]   It's pretty astonishing how fast the stock market recovered.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.800]   Pretty astonishing.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:36.180]   I did not expect basically a five-month turnaround.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:45.440]   I'm skeptical that that was the end of it, but at the end of the day, how can I know?
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:54.160]   How can I predict hundreds of millions of people and their individual actions?
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.520]   That's very, very hard to predict.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:06.160]   I think there's good reason to believe that many sectors of stocks are overvalued.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.960]   I think there's good reason to believe that many stocks are overvalued.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.000]   I guess probably the most interesting one would be a company like Tesla.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   A few weeks ago, the market cap of Tesla was $450 billion, something like that.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.400]   I saw somebody made the comparison.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.440]   I wish I'd checked the numbers myself.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:31.360]   I just saw it made, so if this isn't accurate, you let me know.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:38.320]   You could either buy all of Tesla for $450 billion-ish, or you could buy all of Ford,
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:48.320]   GM, Toyota, Honda, and Nissan and still have $100 billion left over.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:57.880]   That's pretty staggering, pretty stunning to see that one company with modest sales
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:03.360]   figures is valued more than Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda, and Nissan.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:15.720]   I saw the headlines from today that after being excluded from the S&P 500 listing, Tesla
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:23.200]   lost more value than General Motors and Ford combined.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:31.000]   The stock dumped off 20-something percent in a day, and it lost more value than GM and
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.320]   Ford's entire market value combined.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.120]   Tesla has been a winner for a lot of people.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.120]   Would you buy it?
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.560]   Would you buy it at the current price?
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.680]   That's the kind of question you have to answer.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.360]   I wouldn't.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:56.600]   I cannot conceive of a world in which Tesla is worth more than GM, Ford, and Nissan, and
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.000]   Toyota.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.200]   I can't see anything particularly all that unique about their technology, any particular
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.160]   strength that they have, but maybe I don't know the market.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.160]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.920]   Here's what's so fascinating.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:16.080]   I think we live in an era, a new era with regard to financial markets.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.520]   How do you know what the numbers even should be?
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:23.800]   Let me throw a couple other interesting tidbits at you from a financial newsletter that I
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.800]   read.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:29.000]   Here are just some interesting market extremities of recent days.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.320]   Amazon is now 43% of the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.960]   One company is now 43% of the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.200]   Nearly two-thirds of the market is underperforming so far this year.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.880]   Only one in three stocks are actually in the green for the year to date.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.680]   One in five stocks are down 50% or more from their all-time highs.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:56.920]   The five largest stocks in the S&P 500 have a combined market cap that equals the smallest
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.800]   389 stocks.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:05.600]   I repeat, the five largest stocks in the S&P 500 have a combined market cap that equals
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.880]   the smallest 389 stocks.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:17.240]   Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, four companies, have a combined market cap over
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:24.040]   $6 trillion that is greater than the GDP of every country in the world save the United
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.600]   States and China.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:31.160]   And Tesla, prior to today, Tesla has become the ninth largest stock in the United States
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:38.440]   having surpassed Walmart with one-twentieth of the revenue.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:44.240]   So you know, for my bullish friends, you say, they say, "Well, none of this matters."
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.440]   Maybe it doesn't, right?
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.720]   Maybe it doesn't matter.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:32:01.120]   But to say it rather blithely to me, it's just, it seems strange to say it, again, blithely.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:06.720]   When you look at the price to earnings ratios and you look at some of where we are, it's
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.720]   historic.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.320]   It's absolutely historic.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.600]   But what should you do about it?
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.600]   I don't know.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.840]   You should focus on your individual financial plan.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.880]   So if you need more cash, you should sell stocks, not because the market is overvalued,
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.120]   but because you need cash.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:27.760]   Why did I not tell my aunt to sell stocks?
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:34.220]   The reason was I did an analysis of her financial plan, not of her portfolio value.
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.300]   I did an analysis of her financial plan.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.560]   And what did her financial plan say?
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.760]   She lives in a paid-for house.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.520]   She has no debt.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:48.520]   She has a steady pension income that's guaranteed to come in.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.680]   She has very low expenses.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:55.280]   She could actually, with a little bit of belt tightening, which she was happy to do, she
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:59.000]   could live on her pension income without touching her stocks.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.840]   She grows a garden in her backyard.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.000]   She has food in her pantry.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.720]   And so in her situation, why should she sell stocks and get out of the stock market?
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.840]   Now would I run my financial life the same way that she does?
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.840]   No.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.240]   She's not me.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   She's not going to go and buy a rental property.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.800]   She's not going to go and invest in condos on the beach in Nicaragua.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:25.220]   She's not going to buy gold coins and put them in a coffee can.
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:31.960]   For her, a well-diversified portfolio across broad financial asset classes is an excellent
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.960]   solution.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.960]   And I didn't tell her to sell.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.580]   I told her to sit tight.
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.920]   But the reason she could do that was because she had a good financial plan.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.920]   And that's my message.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.780]   You can control your financial plan.
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.700]   You can't control the stock market.
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.620]   You can't control the US economy.
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.460]   You can't control the US government spending.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:56.660]   You can control your individual plans.
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:04.460]   Now, let's talk about catastrophe for a moment.
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:12.760]   Well, in my opinion, catastrophe is possible at any point in time.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:19.540]   And history is filled with catastrophes.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:26.280]   Sudden massive catastrophes are on a broad scale are very unlikely.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.460]   The worst case predictions seem to very, very rarely play out.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:39.600]   And you need to be careful that you don't depend on doomsday movies or post-apocalyptic
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.820]   books for your accurate understanding of reality.
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.240]   A doomsday movie is fun.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:50.160]   A post-apocalyptic book is great.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.160]   I love them.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.160]   They're fun.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.560]   They're not reality though.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:01.920]   And reality is generally much more tame than those narratives.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:07.800]   And so we need to always begin by recognizing that catastrophic predictions very, very rarely
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.280]   play out on a broad scale.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.280]   Why?
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.280]   Why not?
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.240]   Why don't they usually play out?
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.820]   I think there are many reasons.
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:26.360]   First of all, the risks are often overly emphasized.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:32.020]   In addition, they don't play out because human beings are smart.
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:39.660]   What do you think we would see all around the world if the coronavirus pandemic were
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:44.500]   10 times more lethal than it has proved to be?
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:49.300]   What do you think we would see if instead of something like a 0.4% infection fatality
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:56.300]   rate, you had a 5% infection fatality rate?
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.840]   There would be no debate about masks.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.140]   There would be no debate about lockdowns.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:06.620]   There would be no debate about people getting back to work and opening up their businesses.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:12.040]   We would all be sitting in our houses, sending money to vaccine companies to develop a vaccine
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.900]   and voluntarily supporting them and doing internet sleuthing on every drug known to
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.600]   man to try to come up with a new therapeutic cure.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.420]   Because human beings are smart.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:28.220]   They can accurately assess risk for themselves and they can accurately assess information.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.620]   Why do you see so much pushback all around the world?
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:36.380]   Just yesterday I saw in Spain some police officers were trying to arrest a woman for
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:41.140]   not wearing a mask and all the bystanders accosted the police officers, pulled them
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.820]   off of the woman and got the woman free.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.820]   It was great.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:48.380]   It was great to see that, that pushback after watching people arrested all over the world,
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.140]   people in Australia and all over the world arrested for not wearing a mask.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.220]   It was great to see the bystanders say, "No, you're not arresting this person."
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.980]   I think we'll see a lot more of that.
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:01.740]   I think you see it the strongest in the United States, a culture that's deeply rebellious
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.420]   at its core, but you'll see it around the world.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.420]   Why?
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.500]   Because people look at it and say, "It's not that big a threat.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.500]   You're killing me with this stuff.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.500]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.780]   I'm not going to comply."
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:16.260]   Because they're smart.
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.700]   People understand that the risks are not what we previously feared.
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:28.020]   And so in the midst of catastrophe, people quickly adjust, companies adjust, people react
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:33.020]   quickly and this is so often what is unknown to prognosticators.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:37.260]   Prognosticators assume that everything is going to continue as it is and thus disaster
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.260]   is inevitable.
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:42.700]   The most striking example of this would be if you were to go back to the 1970s and look
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:46.620]   at all the predictions about overpopulation and global famine and whatnot.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:51.260]   Many smart people looked at that and said, "Wow, this is really catastrophic and this
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:55.340]   is really, really bad and this is the population bomb is going to explode and everyone's going
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.340]   to die."
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.300]   It didn't happen.
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.340]   Why not?
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:05.620]   Reason is because the prognosticators didn't account for human ingenuity and human changing.
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:10.040]   They didn't account for massive plummeting of birth rates.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.700]   They didn't account for massive increases in productivity from an agricultural perspective,
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.700]   etc.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:24.740]   Which is why I don't take most disaster predictions, I shouldn't say I don't take them seriously.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:28.540]   I don't think the worst case scenario is likely.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.580]   You see something like global warming, right?
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.540]   The world is going to fall apart because of global warming.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.540]   I don't think so.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:34.540]   I don't think so.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:35.540]   Will there be changes?
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:36.540]   Sure.
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:40.100]   I have no reason why I'm opposed to the concept of global warming, but I don't think it's
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.460]   going to be a disaster catastrophic prediction because people will change.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.580]   What are going to be the solutions to whatever problems end up resulting?
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:55.140]   I don't know, but I guarantee you they'll be developed and there will be no catastrophe.
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.020]   You see it again and again.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:00.140]   You see that people are the world's greatest resource.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:03.500]   They're resilient, they're smart, they're thoughtful.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:09.940]   So when you try to figure out what's going to happen to the United States or the US economy
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:18.180]   or the US markets or the US fiscal situation, although I find it very easy to say there's
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:27.340]   going to be a major problem, I don't mean that in a doomsday scenario.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.900]   And I think being outside of the United States gives me far more appreciation of the United
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.660]   States than many other people have.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:41.500]   First we always need to look and say, why have all the previous bears been wrong?
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:46.340]   People have been predicting the implosion of the United States due to overspending since
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:50.060]   the 1970s, maybe earlier, I don't know.
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:53.480]   The government debt is at $1 trillion.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.980]   So what?
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.740]   Government debt is at $5 trillion.
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.220]   So what?
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:02.460]   In this case, running a what?
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:08.860]   We don't know the numbers for sure yet, but a couple, trillions of dollars of deficit.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:13.780]   The answer could be, so what?
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:17.340]   I think it's a very serious problem.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.860]   I think it's a problem that will be very difficult.
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.160]   But is it an end of the world as we know it scenario?
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.380]   Is it a catastrophe?
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:26.380]   Probably not.
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:34.820]   And the reason is you're dealing with a country and a people of tremendous resources.
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.700]   Let me give you two examples that affected me.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:43.260]   I want you to think about two major, major disasters, one of which happened in Haiti,
[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:49.580]   the earthquake of 2010, the other of which happened in Japan, the earthquake and subsequent
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.800]   tsunami of 2011.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:41:03.620]   If I took you to Haiti today, you would see major signs of the earthquake and major dysfunction.
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:08.100]   I don't know this for sure, but I would bet, and any of my Japanese resident listeners,
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:14.260]   let me know, I would bet that if we went to Japan, with the exception of the zones that
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:19.540]   may be forbidden with the nuclear reactors and whatnot, I would bet that it would be
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:27.660]   difficult at this point in time for a layman observer to see the results of the tsunami
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.660]   in Japan.
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.560]   Why?
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:37.040]   I was in Haiti in 2012 and I was just stunned at how it was more than two years after the
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:41.620]   earthquake and I saw UN vehicles and Red Cross people and whatnot, but I was just stunned
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.780]   at how nothing was happening.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:49.340]   At that time, the presidential mansion was still not in ruins, but there were major problems.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.900]   There were entire towns that were in ruins.
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.380]   I was stunned.
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.260]   Whereas in Japan, if you go back and you look at the reports from Japan two years, three
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:04.380]   years after the tsunami, in many cases, at least through the limits of a photographer's
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:09.940]   lens, in many cases you couldn't see it, or at least all the stuff was cleaned up.
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.980]   At least all of the trash was cleaned up.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.020]   The airports were working again.
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:19.020]   The roads were rebuilt in many cases, very, very quickly.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:26.640]   And I thought this is a really good example of how incredibly durable countries that have
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.580]   resources are compared to countries that aren't.
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:33.200]   Japan has had financial problems for decades.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.660]   They have a population crisis.
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.820]   They have economic problems.
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:42.220]   But life in Japan can be great.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.420]   It's not a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:48.140]   Haiti, on the other hand, is very much like a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:53.980]   It's a very difficult place, very difficult for anybody to make progress.
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.580]   And so when you look at the United States, for all of its dysfunction and for all of
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:03.500]   its problems, don't take the perspective that it's just going to collapse.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.780]   It's not going to collapse.
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:08.980]   Doesn't mean it won't be crises, won't be difficult things.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:11.700]   It's not going to collapse.
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.700]   Similar things like with the US dollar.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.060]   Does the US dollar have problems?
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.060]   Sure.
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.500]   It's a better option than many other places.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.660]   And so what you need to evaluate is you need to evaluate where are you in the world and
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:25.180]   see it seriously.
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:32.020]   This is where I think it's so hard for Americans especially, because as US Americans, we're
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:37.340]   so used to thinking of ourselves at the center of the world, and we see the problems in our
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:41.660]   own lives that we don't see what we're comparing to.
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.820]   Example, Lebanon.
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:50.060]   Lebanon has been quite literally and metaphorically leveled.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:55.460]   Lebanon was already dealing with a tremendous financial crisis, was already dealing with
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.060]   hyperinflation.
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:03.260]   Then they have this catastrophic explosion.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.660]   Lebanon will not recover quickly.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:10.860]   And so if you're living in Lebanon, you're living in a country that doesn't have the
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.020]   resources to recover quickly.
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.700]   It's a devastating situation.
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:20.300]   It was already a financially devastating situation.
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:28.740]   But for a wealthy Lebanese businessman who had his financial accounts in the United States,
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:31.180]   he's insulated.
[00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:35.180]   And maybe his primary home was in Beirut, but if he had a secondary home out in the
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:39.940]   countryside that he could go to, try to keep his business going, or maybe fold up shop,
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:43.740]   or have some diversification into business operations, he can be okay.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.940]   It's going to be a long, difficult recovery, but all the stuff we talk about, all the stuff
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.660]   you do to prepare for things works.
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:51.660]   It works.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.460]   And if that Lebanese businessman had moved some money from stocks into cash to prepare
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:02.140]   for the global pandemic, he probably was able to pick up some deals during the local hyperinflation
[00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:09.500]   that was happening there, and probably is now grateful that he has cash, because he
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:14.140]   figures out how can I rebuild my businesses and rebuild my community in the wake of this
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.020]   devastation.
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:19.420]   But Lebanon and the United States are not the same.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:29.820]   If you leveled Washington DC to the ground, if you dumped 10 nuclear missiles into the
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:36.540]   heart of Washington DC, psychologically it would be a major impact.
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:43.460]   Functionally, financially for the country, it would be a modest blip.
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.140]   Think about something like 9/11.
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:50.660]   9/11 leveled to, I guess, how many, what?
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:57.580]   A bunch of really important buildings in the heart of New York City.
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:01.860]   It's hard to imagine devastation worse than 9/11.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:04.700]   Psychologically, massive influence.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:10.060]   Financially, a blip, a blip.
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:13.900]   If you had enough cash in your account so you didn't have to sell stocks for a few years,
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.260]   you were fine.
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.260]   Could it have been worse?
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.260]   I guess.
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:24.160]   And I think it's important to look at threats and try to understand the severity of threats.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.020]   Why was I so concerned about a pandemic?
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:30.300]   I was just talking with a friend of mine about disaster planning.
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:31.300]   Okay?
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:36.620]   And we were talking, I don't know why, I never intended to become like the disaster expert,
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:41.980]   but I guess it is a unique thing that I understand and pay attention to that most people don't.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:48.100]   But we were talking about disasters and we were talking about nuclear war.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:55.220]   And for me, this was the cornerstone in my thinking when I realized that nuclear war
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:47:00.340]   I had thought nuclear war was this just unsurvivable thing.
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:06.140]   That if nuclear warheads went off in Seattle, Washington, I would be dead in Florida.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:07.140]   Right?
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:13.220]   It's silly, but you have this idea that nuclear war just makes a post-apocalyptic world everywhere.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:20.860]   Then I started studying it and I realized how incredibly survivable nuclear war actually
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.140]   is.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:29.860]   Now the threat of nuclear war is a serious, legitimate, very real threat.
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:35.620]   For you to go back to during the cold war, there were a couple of times during the cold
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:44.180]   war where basically the world was one man's decision away from actually launching a hot
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:48.220]   nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the United States of America.
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.540]   And it would have been bad.
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:53.540]   It wouldn't have been, however, unsurvivable.
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:48:02.060]   When I realized that, it made me realize how even this thing that seems totally catastrophic
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:07.820]   and genuinely is really a catastrophe, it would be fairly localized, fairly isolated,
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:11.260]   and it's eminently survivable.
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.260]   Other ones, right?
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:16.900]   Remember one of the disaster movies or disaster books that really hit me hard was the Lights
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:17.900]   Out book.
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.260]   Phenomenal book.
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.260]   So well written.
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.580]   It just puts me to tears to read that book.
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:29.620]   But it's all about the threat of electromagnetic pulse and has become the basis of many preppers'
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:33.580]   concerns and I think rightly so.
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:40.620]   If the electricity goes out for the long term, it would be a major, major cause of death
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:45.180]   in any country in the world, but especially in a modern advanced technologically dependent
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:46.980]   country.
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:51.540]   But when you actually look at it and you think about what happens in electromagnetic pulse,
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:49:01.140]   I think the risk that is drawn by a novel like that is wildly overstated.
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:03.940]   Shielding and modern equipment is much better than it once was.
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.660]   It's getting better all the time.
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:11.180]   The actual logistics of detonating a successful electromagnetic pulse attack over a large
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:15.180]   area are vanishingly difficult.
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:21.180]   Could a terrorist set off a localized small nuclear bomb at ground level and with that
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:23.740]   wipe out a city's electrical grid?
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:24.740]   Sure.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.220]   Wipe out a state on the other hand or a country?
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:32.260]   Very, very difficult and wouldn't be 100% killing of all of the electrical issues in
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:34.420]   my opinion.
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:36.380]   But what is the issue?
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:37.780]   What is the most lethal?
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:42.220]   The answer is it's a pandemic.
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:49.660]   Actually in my opinion, anybody who didn't take the threat of a pandemic seriously, especially
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:56.780]   back in the beginning of 2020 when the data was very strange to cover, was foolish at
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:00.820]   best and stupid at worst.
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:12.860]   A pandemic, a global pandemic, disease pandemic is one of the very few genuinely global events.
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:17.380]   If you have the right combination of a lethal disease that kills a lot of people but not
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:25.020]   too many so it can still replicate, our modern world is sitting wide open for a pandemic
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:31.380]   and the follow on economic effects of it are catastrophic, which is why the lockdowns have
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.380]   been so catastrophic.
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.980]   Now were the lockdowns the right move or not?
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:40.460]   At this point they sure seem to not be, but were they the right move back then?
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:42.340]   If I were emperor of the world, I wouldn't have said it.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.620]   I wouldn't have imposed lockdowns.
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:49.620]   I wouldn't have closed businesses because I believe that's a fundamental violation of
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:54.900]   my responsibilities as the emperor of the world, but I understand why they did.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.220]   I'm not too mad about it.
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:00.980]   But a pandemic is genuinely that terrible.
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:07.740]   And so it's nice to do some quarterbacking, but man I'm glad that things are not as bad
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.700]   as they would have been.
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:12.500]   And that was my realization through it.
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:18.500]   As I worked my way through it I realized this is not romantic, this is not fun, this is
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.140]   terrible.
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:26.340]   And I didn't want it of course, I'm not that immature, but still you always wonder well
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:27.580]   what's it going to be like?
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:31.700]   It's terrible as we all know now, it's terrible.
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:38.420]   So where do we go from here economically, in the markets, the fiscal situation?
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:48.860]   I don't have any regrets about what I said with regard to preparing, being heavy on cash.
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:53.780]   If I had perfect foreknowledge and I knew that five months later the stock market would
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:58.660]   be totally recovered I would give exactly the same advice again.
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:07.500]   Zero regrets about that whatsoever.
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:16.540]   In many cases, for many people, possibly even for you, having access to things like cash
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:22.580]   is setting things up for you to have bargains and opportunities, which is always the way
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:25.780]   that you want to profit off of a crisis.
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:30.240]   Why do I advocate for people to not have every dollar invested?
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.780]   Part of it is defensive, part of it is offensive.
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:37.280]   I try to teach this at the basic levels of personal finance.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:43.180]   Why do I recommend to a young person that before they go and they start obsessing like
[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:47.460]   I did, which I now consider a mistake, why do I recommend that a young person accumulate
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:55.980]   $10,000 in cash before they start buying stocks in their IRA?
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:53:00.700]   Which by the way, it's totally fine with me if your $10,000 is in cash in a Roth IRA,
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:03.660]   that's a great way to split the difference, but why do I want them to have that?
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:07.700]   Well, if you think about a young person and you think about what can be had if you have
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:14.940]   $10,000 of cash and you need a car and there's a guy that's selling a lovely, very sexy Toyota
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:20.420]   Corolla, four years old, and if you can give him cash today, he'll give it to you for six
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:25.080]   grand instead of its blue book value of 12 grand.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.360]   Those kinds of deals make a big, big difference.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.560]   Cash is not just defensive, cash is an opportunity fund.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.420]   What about that same guy though, the defensive side?
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:37.100]   A young person has $10,000 of cash is effectively bulletproof from getting laid off.
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:40.100]   They don't like their work, they just cut that career short and say, "That's it, I'm
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.100]   leaving."
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.660]   They don't have to sit around and go through what most of us have gone through, "I got
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:44.900]   to go find another job."
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:50.540]   They can just leave because when you can live on $800 a month, that $10,000 makes you effectively
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.540]   bulletproof.
[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:55.420]   You can leave any job where you're mistreated and you can cut all the time-wasting stuff
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:59.980]   short and make much faster progress in your career.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:04.660]   So I don't regret the advice, I think it was prudent advice given the time.
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:08.420]   And if you saw that the market dropped by 40% and you looked around and said, "I don't
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:11.580]   need this cash," I hope you bought.
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:17.860]   I hope you looked down and said, "Hey, I've been watching XYZ Company and I'm going to
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.740]   buy some of this."
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:23.540]   And that's where fortunes are made.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:27.660]   What's going to happen from here in the stock market?
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:30.420]   No idea about the stock market.
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:35.980]   Stock market to me is driven by a number of interesting benefits and a number of interesting
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:37.460]   problems.
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:41.220]   Some of the problems would be things like mass participation.
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:45.740]   I'm convinced that many people, if they were professional stock investors, would not buy
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:52.820]   into many companies and into the stock market at its valuations if they knew what they were
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:53.940]   doing.
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:59.980]   But the reality is most stock purchases are made totally automatically.
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:05.220]   You get a paycheck, you get paid $10,000 a month and you put $1,000 a month into your
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:08.780]   401(k), well there's automatic stock purchases.
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:11.420]   How do we measure the impact of that on the market overall?
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:15.540]   I don't know, but I think that the numbers that we face are new.
[00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:21.340]   There's such an overwhelming victory of the stick with it, dollar cost average in, by
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:22.820]   passive investments.
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:26.820]   There's such an overwhelming victory in the marketplace that I think that makes for a
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:30.980]   much more resilient market than many other scenarios, but I'm not close enough to it
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:31.980]   to know.
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:33.780]   I don't know what's going to happen with the stock market.
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:36.740]   What's going to happen to the economy in the United States?
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:41.860]   Well it's taken a beating, but the people who are being affected by the economy, and
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:46.380]   this is where things are so tricky with the stock market too, are often not that important
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.180]   to the economy.
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:55.140]   This is what's so difficult about the way that the markets are set up.
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:56:01.420]   Your brother-in-law who got laid off from his job as a restaurant manager, how much
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:05.100]   does he actually contribute to the economy?
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:07.060]   Not that much.
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:08.060]   Not all that much.
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:12.860]   Makes $60,000 a year, not that much.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:14.660]   It's not that big a thing.
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:18.020]   Whereas how much does a company like Amazon contribute?
[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.020]   Well, a lot.
[00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:23.700]   There's a lot of economic activity associated with Amazon.
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:28.700]   This is where when you look at things, it's so hard to figure out where people started
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:29.700]   buying less.
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:34.700]   Well yeah, on the local basis, restaurants are getting hammered.
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:37.580]   Everybody who works in the restaurant segment is getting hammered, but are those people
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:41.440]   who got laid off of restaurants still buying stuff on Amazon?
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.440]   They do, right?
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:45.620]   They're spending their stimulus checks and their savings on that and their credit card
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:50.180]   debt on Amazon Prime and books and games and all that stuff.
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:51.740]   They're still active there.
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:56.220]   And so figuring out where these things go, I don't know.
[00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:59.940]   I don't see any kind of catastrophe for the economy.
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:03.900]   What I see is changes.
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:04.900]   That's always what happens.
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:09.900]   You almost never have catastrophe where everything falls apart and it goes back to the old way.
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.060]   What you see is massive changes.
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:14.940]   And so are major segments of the economy falling apart?
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:15.940]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:19.020]   Commercial real estate in a big city, New York City, yes.
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:22.260]   Lots of companies canceling their big expansion plans.
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.460]   But is that bad on the other side?
[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:27.260]   I don't think it's bad on the whole.
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:29.220]   It's just going to mean growth and change.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:34.900]   And so your job is not to worry about the economy, but your job is to look and say,
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:38.020]   what's happening in the economies that I can track?
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:44.020]   If you're a commercial landlord in New York City, it's not as rosy of a future as it was.
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:50.020]   If you were a taxicab medallion investor and you got decimated, totally decimated, you're
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:51.860]   bankrupt right now.
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:56.180]   On the other hand, if you're a real estate agent in South Florida, you're doing better
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:57.180]   than ever.
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:02.680]   I've been amazed to see how strong the real estate market is.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:06.900]   All across the country, you hear reports of people saying, man, real estate market here
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:08.420]   is so fast.
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:12.420]   And so that's where we've got to be is you've got to say, what are the trends?
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:13.420]   What's happening in the economy?
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:14.580]   What are people doing?
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:19.700]   And then put yourself in the way of some of that money with a trade, with a business,
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:23.660]   with some way to capitalize on where things are going right now.
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:26.460]   What's going to happen with the fiscal situation?
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:27.460]   I don't know.
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:29.700]   I didn't mean to sound so dumb.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:30.700]   I don't know.
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:31.700]   I don't know.
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:38.500]   But the point is that I don't have the competence to make long-term predictions.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:41.020]   I say that and I'm going to make one.
[00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:46.300]   Obviously, the US government will default on its debt.
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:51.020]   But I think that default, number one, is not necessarily directly related to the economy
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:52.980]   and the stock market.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:59.260]   Just like the economy and the stock market are not fundamentally intertwined necessarily,
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:03.300]   or your local economy is not fundamentally intertwined with the stock market, I think
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:06.820]   that the fiscal situation is not fundamentally intertwined with the economy and the stock
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:07.820]   market.
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:11.420]   Just because the US government defaults on its debt doesn't mean that the stock market
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:12.940]   doesn't go up.
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:15.580]   I don't know.
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:16.620]   But it won't be paid.
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:17.820]   So how will it be defaulted on?
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.260]   I think just a series of changes.
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:20.540]   They'll change the laws.
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.780]   They'll add means testing to Social Security.
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:24.260]   They'll change the retirement ages.
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.260]   They'll adjust this, adjust that.
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:28.540]   And it can go on for far longer.
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:32.420]   I think that one of the things that should be very clear is that anybody who makes a
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:37.300]   prediction that this has to end by this date, it's hard to find anyone who has made those
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:39.880]   predictions accurately.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:43.940]   So the absolute numbers are hard.
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:47.940]   There's no absolute valuation of the price to earnings ratio that is right.
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:52.820]   There's no absolute valuation of the price of gold that is right.
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:56.580]   You're always investing and comparing your investments and the use of your dollars to
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:59.740]   what alternative investments are available.
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:04.660]   And so why, for example, is the US stock market doing so well?
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:10.660]   I don't know, but I think probably one reason would be it's the best place available for
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:14.420]   many investors to put their money, even on a global scale.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.420]   What else are you going to do with your money?
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.220]   What else are you going to invest in?
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:18.220]   It's so easy to invest in.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.860]   It's so strong.
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:23.300]   Companies are so strong, globally diversified, powerhouses, et cetera.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:30.140]   So there's all these factors that are just outside of your control.
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:36.980]   I want to focus now as I wind down is how do you get ready?
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:42.220]   What did I mean when I said if the Fed and Congress can dump an insane amount of money
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:44.620]   and save this sinking ship one last time, that would be awesome.
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:48.380]   It would also mean I would triple down on my bet against the future of XYZ.
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:55.740]   What I meant when I said that was I don't want my future to be tied to any one thing.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.380]   I don't want my future to be tied to any one market.
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:01.820]   I don't want my future to be tied to any one industry.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:05.780]   I don't want my future to be tied to any one country.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.860]   I want to be diversified.
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.060]   I don't want to just have stocks.
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:13.780]   I want to have stocks and real estate and a business that's creating cash flow.
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:15.140]   I don't want just a business creating cash flow.
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.300]   I want all the others.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.780]   I want to be diversified.
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:19.380]   I don't want to just own paper assets.
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:22.620]   I want to own real assets and I want to own business assets.
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:24.140]   I want to be diversified.
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:30.440]   And I don't want to be dependent on one economy, one, you know, the American economy as strong
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.440]   as it is.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.440]   I don't want to be dependent on it.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.940]   I want to be, I don't want to be independent.
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:38.380]   Sorry, I don't want to be dependent on one currency.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:42.340]   I don't want to be dependent on one location.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:45.340]   I want to be ready.
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:48.860]   But the reality is there are different versions of that.
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:52.380]   There's the best case scenario and then there's the worst case scenario.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:56.560]   On the best case scenario, I'd like to have a handful of businesses all paying me millions
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.500]   of dollars a year.
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:03.540]   I'd like to have investments all around the world in all different asset classes in all
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:04.540]   different situations.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:07.620]   It's going to take me some time to build that.
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:14.060]   On the worst case scenario though, I just want to have some safe places to go, some
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:18.300]   protection and some insulation against bad things happening.
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:22.940]   And what I think you can see from even this current economic crisis, which is, we don't
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:28.760]   know the full extent or the full length of it, but very, very severe, likely to be continue
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:38.080]   for a time, is you see how the basic fundamentals, the personal finance 101 works.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.080]   It works.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.080]   Right?
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:47.300]   My aunt, no debt, paid for house, modest fixed expenses, able to live on her social security
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:53.260]   check and has an investment portfolio that's healthy as well to give her discretionary
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:54.260]   money.
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:55.260]   It worked.
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.260]   And a garden in the backyard.
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:57.260]   It works.
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:58.260]   She's not suffered.
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:02:59.460]   She doesn't need anything.
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:00.980]   She didn't need some fancy plan.
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:02.920]   She didn't need...
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.180]   It works.
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.620]   The basics work.
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:12.100]   So engage in the basic common sense prudent financial management.
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.660]   Debt.
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.780]   Handle debt carefully.
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:19.820]   Strive for no debt, if that's appropriate for you.
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:23.860]   Being debt free, you have all the options in the world.
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:30.220]   If you're a business owner and your businesses were shut down by the government, if you have
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:35.740]   no debt, you lay off all your employees, you pay the basic fixed costs that you need to
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:40.660]   keep the lights on so your building doesn't grow mold and do the very basics and you wait
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.660]   until you can reopen.
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.340]   And you're not bankrupt because of it.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.700]   Why are all these big brands going bankrupt?
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:54.900]   Why does J.Crew go bankrupt and Hertz car rental, et cetera?
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.620]   It's because they have debt.
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:02.240]   Massive massive amounts of debt due to the financial engineering of the financial class.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.380]   So in your situation, if you avoid debt, you'll have a rock stable business.
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.940]   Dave Ramsey's not hurting.
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:12.220]   He's doing fine.
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:14.760]   So no debt, worth having.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:20.900]   If you have debt, making sure that it's carefully segmented, making sure that the debt is located
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:25.200]   on these assets over here, but these other assets over here are okay.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:30.340]   So in a worst case scenario, call the creditors, sorry guys, can't pay, take the assets and
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:34.780]   you just simply carve off that portion of your asset base, but everything else is still
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.260]   safe.
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:38.820]   Or carefully negotiated debt.
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:44.340]   If you had all your debt, right, I have the credit card course, the credit card course
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.500]   that I teach.
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:52.700]   If all of your debt was unsecured debt, just simply credit card, and you lost your job
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:59.900]   back in March and you couldn't pay your credit cards, your life would not have changed in
[01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:03.100]   the last six months.
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.620]   Nothing was taken from you.
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.580]   Nothing disappeared.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:11.180]   You just couldn't pay your credit cards.
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.080]   The credit card companies understand.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.980]   You tell them, listen, when I get a job, I'll pay you.
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:18.180]   When you get a job, you're going to go back and pay them.
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:24.100]   Obviously your credit rating is going to be hurt, but your life is okay.
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.860]   Which is why it's so important to think about the kinds of debt that you accept and how
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:31.200]   you negotiate that debt.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.520]   At its core, you always have a bankruptcy plan.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:39.160]   You always make sure that if I go bankrupt, what do I come out the other side with?
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:42.380]   And make sure that you think about that with everything that you do.
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:45.680]   That's 101, prudent financial management.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.680]   What else?
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:47.680]   Insurance.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.900]   Being properly insured against common risks.
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:53.200]   If you have health insurance and you got COVID and you got all these hospital bills, health
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.680]   insurance take care of it.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.840]   If you got car insurance, you probably got discounts because you're not driving, but
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:05.400]   all the nuts and bolts, house insurance, all the stuff still works.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.400]   Investments.
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:13.920]   If your investments were thoughtfully diversified in advance of the crisis and they're properly
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:21.280]   chosen for you based upon your financial needs, everything has worked.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:26.380]   You know, some of the old things about don't invest money you can't afford to lose.
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:30.840]   If you didn't ignore that, you were fine when the markets were down 30%.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:35.560]   Little things like don't invest money in stocks that you need within five years.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:41.180]   If you paid attention to that, you've been fine because your market value's recovered.
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:42.400]   Cash management.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:47.600]   Making sure you have the ability to protect yourself and you have emergency funds.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:52.560]   Three to six months emergency fund goes a long way for many people.
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.080]   One year emergency fund, great.
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.280]   Whatever your particular approach is.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.580]   It worked.
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:06:59.580]   It works.
[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:02.040]   It's still working and it worked.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.760]   I've hammered the need to keep an income.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.400]   I've said it again and again.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.920]   If you can keep your job through a crisis, you're going to be fine.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:15.520]   Well, if you can keep your job through a crisis, you're fine.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.680]   Is unemployment up?
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:17.680]   Yes.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:18.680]   But why do we work so hard?
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:22.280]   Why in my radical personal finance guide to career and income planning, why in that course
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:26.800]   do I work so hard on making sure that you have a network, a place that you can go?
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:30.320]   Why do I focus on having everything squared away?
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.760]   It's because if you lost your job and you had a network, you could have another job
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:34.760]   quickly.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.880]   There's been plenty of things that you can do.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:40.880]   It's so important that you not ignore that stuff because if you could just simply keep
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:45.320]   your job, you've been fine.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.040]   You've been totally fine.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.440]   You got to be a high performer.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:54.600]   You got to have economically valuable skills so you can directly trace your production
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:59.680]   and your productivity to your income so you're not just dead weight at your company.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.840]   And you need to maintain backup plans, backup careers, backup jobs, et cetera.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:04.840]   It worked.
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.840]   It's still working.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.280]   It works.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.600]   What about a prudent relocation plan?
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:16.080]   The ability to leave a problem area and go to where there are fewer problems.
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:21.120]   Right now, there are people all around the place whose cities are being rocked by violence
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:24.000]   who are using their relocation plans.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.360]   If you're living in a downtown corridor where people, protesters are burning down buildings
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:33.400]   on your block, et cetera, you have the ability to relocate.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:34.400]   And it's simple.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:37.840]   It's calling your cousin who lives a couple of counties away and saying, "I'm going to
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.560]   send the kids out for a couple of weeks at the farm.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:45.680]   Just wanted to let you know the city's not working for us right now."
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:50.320]   I've talked in my preparedness courses and whatnot, I've talked about the importance
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:54.520]   and value of even just a simple strategy.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:58.440]   I have this thing about even if you don't have anything at the basic level, having a
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:04.160]   little cargo trailer with a nice tent in it and some food and some electricity stuff and
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:08.680]   some basic tools and whatnot that you could just hook up your cargo trailer and go camping.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:12.180]   If you were locked down in New York City and you couldn't go anywhere, couldn't do anything,
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:17.140]   you could just hook up your cargo trailer if you had a car and go upstate, go out on
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:20.440]   some government land or go to a campground and you can live well.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.600]   You can fish every day, go to the lake, you can do great.
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.200]   Or you go out anywhere and that stuff works.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.460]   Maybe you've implemented a little bit more.
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:29.440]   You have your vacation house.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.380]   Where did all the New Yorkers go?
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:32.880]   They went to their second homes.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.420]   It's perfect.
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.800]   Having a second house can be simply, "Oh, we've got the cabin on the lake."
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:43.160]   Or, "We like to go out in the summertime to our country cousin's farmhouse."
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:47.660]   Or maybe you just have a little flat in a far off city, a little apartment that you
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:48.660]   maintain.
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:50.220]   It's not much, but it's something.
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.220]   South Florida, you keep a little apartment in Miami.
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:56.200]   Well, you just go down to your apartment in Miami and then you weren't locked down like
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.260]   New York City was.
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:00.500]   You had the ability to go.
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:06.000]   Maybe you maintain a beach house on a Caribbean island and you simply go to your beach house.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.700]   In our current world, that stuff has worked great.
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:10.560]   You're still working from remotely.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.620]   Now instead of being locked down, you can go to the beach, you can take the sun, you're
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:18.220]   not stuck in the middle of a city somewhere, not able to go anywhere with kids driving
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:19.220]   you crazy.
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.420]   You're fine.
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:26.060]   Now, I recommend, this hasn't generally been necessary for most people, but making sure
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:27.780]   that you think about physically supplies.
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:28.780]   So security.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:31.340]   It feels good to have a security plan.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:36.740]   If you've got crowds of angry people coming through your front yard, it's nice to have
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.740]   a security plan in those situations.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:45.820]   Food, water, energy, medical supplies, none of that has been necessary for this crisis,
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:48.680]   but it all still makes sense.
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:54.780]   When you realize how inexpensively the average person can provide for those basic needs and
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:59.120]   be totally bulletproofed, it's a no brainer.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.240]   So in a worst case scenario, you're totally fine.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.220]   I mean, this is the stuff that I teach in my How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.460]   Economic Crisis course.
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:13.300]   I talk a lot about international relocation, but it really works.
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.940]   It really works.
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:20.860]   The United States, if you had a second passport from a little Caribbean country and you kept
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:24.140]   a little piece of real estate there that you could go to, you could get to the country,
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.900]   you could get in, do your little quarantine, and be fine.
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:30.860]   There have been many places around the world that have been totally open for a while when
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:34.060]   Europe was shut down and when the United States was shut down.
[01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:35.500]   You're fine.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:39.860]   If your jobs have disappeared in your city and you can move to another city, or I talk
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:46.220]   about even just being able to move to another country and get a job, it all works.
[01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:50.540]   Hope I haven't been a broken record in this, but my point is that the reason you prepare
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:57.140]   for disaster is so that you can go through it easily and comfortably, so it's not disruptive
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:00.220]   to you.
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:03.060]   I think it's possible to over-prepare for disasters.
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.860]   Some people, it's just fun for them.
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:09.420]   It becomes their hobby, and they're total catastrophists.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:14.300]   But I'm not going to waste my life preparing excessively for something that probably won't
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:15.460]   happen.
[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:21.940]   But a little bit of preparation makes life good in the middle of catastrophe.
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:27.580]   In the same way that having a generator, having storm-proof windows, and just making it a
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:32.180]   habit that you keep some water and food in your house and some gas for the generator
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:37.220]   for your Florida beach house, in the same way that that makes most hurricane warnings
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:42.020]   relatively a non-event, and if your house gets blown down, you have proper insurance
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:45.900]   and you decided to leave or you had some kind of storm shelter in the middle of it, makes
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:53.540]   it mostly an inconvenience rather than a catastrophe, the same thing applies to good financial planning.
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:13:01.620]   You do good financial planning so that you can be minimally affected.
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:10.900]   I have a friend of mine who runs an education business, and it's in a foreign country, and
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:16.180]   his business collapsed because he had to send all his students home, and his business collapsed
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:20.180]   because the foreign country closed the borders, and so no international students were allowed
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:22.740]   to come in.
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:30.020]   He laid off some of his staff members completely, cut everyone's pay to 50%, but he's not worried,
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:35.860]   even though business revenues are zero, he's not worried and hasn't been worried for the
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:43.500]   past six months because he has money, he has cash, doing a little bit of work from home,
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.820]   but when the borders open up, he'll be back at it.
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:50.860]   Might take a few years to recover, but it's not the end of the world.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:58.020]   The end of the world is the guy who doesn't have reserves, who got too far out over the
[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:00.460]   tip of his skis.
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:02.060]   That's the problem.
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:08.460]   So there's nothing wrong with being prudent, there's nothing wrong with preparing.
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:13.700]   It works.
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:19.420]   I have tried to stay away from making market prognostications.
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:25.820]   I think it's fine for that to be done, but I think that the value of the stock market
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:32.200]   in most individuals' people's financial lives is vastly overrated.
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:38.580]   There is abundant information and abundant noise about the gyrations of the market.
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:47.260]   I think that the value of good financial planning is underrated, and people underestimate how
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:56.460]   valuable it is to be able to think about your personal life in a holistic way and then properly
[01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:58.900]   protect it.
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:00.340]   Stocks are great.
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:03.300]   The American stock market is awesome.
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:06.460]   It is very useful.
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:10.300]   I have no problem of people being involved.
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.900]   I'm not saying run for the hills and buy gold.
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:15.420]   I think you should own some gold, but not all.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:18.580]   All your money should not be in gold.
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:23.460]   If you get this stuff right, then you're insulated from the markets enough that you can let them
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:24.820]   run.
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:25.820]   That's always been the power.
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:32.340]   When I was a financial advisor, managing portfolios, selling stocks, I always said, "My job is
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:34.380]   to keep you invested.
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:38.500]   If I do my job right on the financial planning side, I'll be able to talk you into staying
[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.980]   in the market so you don't bail out and destroy your portfolio."
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:46.460]   I still believe that.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:49.260]   The markets are wildly unpredictable.
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:53.420]   30% declines are normal business.
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:56.340]   50% declines happen regularly.
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:59.220]   You should expect it.
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:07.500]   This is how you prepare for it so that it doesn't cause you major harm and major damage.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:12.420]   I want to take a moment as I go and I want to emphasize to you that there's always been
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:18.420]   a method to my madness in the courses that I sell.
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:23.320]   There are three courses right now on the website, radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:27.380]   Those three courses are all related to this theme.
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:28.860]   I've mentioned them in the show.
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:32.540]   The first was career and income planning.
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:35.780]   My headline that I wrote on the ad, "Increase your income and enjoy a richer life now by
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:38.580]   finding or developing work you love."
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:45.340]   What I've focused on is if you have an income and you maintain it through a recession, you
[01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:51.860]   can ignore most recessions and in fact, they become for you an opportunity, the ability
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:55.180]   to buy things at discounted value.
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:58.460]   But you've got to build a solid income plan.
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:02.860]   That income plan should give you a life that you love now while you're working and it should
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:07.940]   throw off so much money that you have the money to invest in case in the future you
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:10.940]   don't want to work for money anymore.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:13.140]   Radical Personal Finance, Guide to Career and Income Planning available.
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:18.100]   Number two, how to survive and thrive during the coming economic crisis, a rational modern
[01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.100]   approach.
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:26.860]   In that course, I lay out that economic crisis is inevitable.
[01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:30.020]   Most of those crises will simply be on an individual level.
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.460]   Some of them will be large scale.
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:33.460]   Can they be global?
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:35.420]   We're in the middle of it.
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:39.220]   But I lay out some strategies in that course that work.
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:44.380]   Half the strategies in the course are about being prepared to be a resilient person.
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:48.860]   If you're debt free, if you have solar panels on your roof that are providing for your electricity
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:53.380]   needs, if you have some food stored or you have a little garden in your backyard, if
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:57.420]   you have some income sources, you're totally fine.
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:59.300]   In addition, you should be prepared to relocate.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:03.780]   I talk a lot about international relocation and you can see the value of that right now.
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:09.060]   I talk about getting residency in foreign countries, second passports, etc.
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:12.660]   Americans have a hard time going many places in the world.
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:18.260]   If you square this away in advance, you go ahead and get yourself another passport.
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:22.620]   Right now, you can travel the world on a St. Kitts and Nevis passport.
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:23.620]   It works great.
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.780]   American passport, not so much.
[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:29.740]   If you're an Italian citizen, you can get into Italy right now and once you're in Italy,
[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:31.700]   you can get into the EU.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:32.700]   You're fine.
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:35.620]   You've got to square that stuff away.
[01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:39.740]   If you open the world up to you, I talk in that situation about a simple example, about
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:43.320]   having a ... I talk about a bug out location.
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.540]   Your bug out location can be simple.
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:46.820]   It doesn't have to be a cabin in the woods unless you want one.
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:56.660]   It can be a little apartment in downtown Paris or downtown Sofia or downtown wherever you're
[01:18:56.660 --> 01:19:00.780]   interested in going.
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:05.380]   A little apartment in another place allows you to leave a place where it's bad.
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:10.260]   If you were living in Italy and you kept a little apartment in Huntsville, Alabama, then
[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:12.620]   you were fine when everything in Italy was going bad.
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:17.580]   If you're living in Huntsville, Alabama and you keep a little apartment in Trento, Italy,
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:20.220]   then you're fine when you go.
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:23.140]   How to survive and thrive during the coming economic crisis is on the site.
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:26.940]   Then finally, how to borrow money safely and never pay interest using credit cards.
[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:31.500]   In that course, I talk about the value of credit cards and I talk about how if you build
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:37.360]   a credit card portfolio before you need it, it gives you a very safe, very low cost way
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:39.180]   of borrowing money.
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:41.220]   Right now, you see the value of that.
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:50.580]   If your debt is structured as unsecured debt and the whole world goes crazy, you're fine.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:53.240]   That's why you think about the security of your debt.
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.620]   If you structured your credit card portfolio in advance so that you have $100,000 of credit
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:01.620]   available to you and you lost your job and you needed to borrow $10,000 or $15,000, you're
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:05.240]   fine if you've planned in advance.
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:09.420]   You're not fine if you had one credit card with a $10,000 credit limit available to you
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:13.660]   and you needed to borrow $10,000 or $15,000 and you're not doing that cheaply.
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:16.860]   You got to build it before you need it and that's available for you on the website as
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.940]   well, how to borrow money safely and never pay interest using credit cards.
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:25.100]   Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store to purchase those courses, radicalpersonalfinance.com/store
[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:29.940]   and I'll be back with you soon.
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:31.100]   Welcome to AutoZone.
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:32.260]   What are you working on today?
