[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780]   The last tip here is take advantage of the Southwest Companion Pass.
[00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.380]   It's one of the best hacks out there because you can earn it without having to even fly the airline.
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.280]   Obviously, if you don't fly Southwest, it doesn't do you any good.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.340]   But you can earn it entirely from credit cards, from credit card welcome bonuses, from shopping portal spend, and stuff like that.
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.880]   And if you hold a Southwest card, you automatically get 10,000 points towards that status without any spend.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.580]   So normally, it would take 135,000 Southwest points.
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.340]   With a credit card, it takes 125,000 points.
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:39.520]   And once you hit Companion Pass, in the year you hit it and the following year, you can nominate a person that you can change, I think, up to three times.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.600]   And that person can travel for free with you.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.160]   You can confirm it at booking.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.860]   And they just have to pay the taxes and fees on the flight.
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.740]   So we've had this in the past.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.600]   And it's not quite two for one because obviously, you have to pay the taxes and fees.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.880]   Though domestically, those taxes and fees are $5.60.
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.080]   So it's pretty close to two for one.
