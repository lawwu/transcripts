[00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.560]   - I wanted to ask about behavioral tools for ADHD.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.680]   I've seen some of the literature claiming
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.880]   that certain video games might actually be useful
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.280]   for training focus.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.520]   I've managed to find a few papers
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.560]   that talk about focus and meditation tasks
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.840]   that kids in particular,
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.400]   but adults may be able to get better at.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.840]   I mean, are any of these brain training games
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.360]   to get people better at focusing?
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.520]   Are any of them known to be worthwhile
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.600]   according to like real data or clinical observation?
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600]   - So I'll start by stepping back a little bit
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.320]   and broadening it, I'll get to the video game things.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.960]   But one of the effective approaches
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.000]   that helps with symptomatic reduction with ADHD
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.040]   is cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.240]   So that's a form of talking therapy.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.400]   And my quick overview of it
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.920]   is that it focuses on actions, thoughts, and feelings
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.760]   and that humans can have direct control
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.880]   of their actions and thoughts,
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.240]   not too much over their feelings,
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.360]   but all three are affecting each other.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.080]   And the traditional CBT was developed by Aaron Beck
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.280]   to treat depression, probably 50 years ago.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.960]   maybe longer 60s, I think, late 60s.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.920]   Anyway, on the surface, it's a horrible match for ADHD
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.760]   because we know it requires lots of repetitive, boring homework,
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.800]   doing the same thing.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.360]   It involves introspection of being aware of what you're doing already,
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.160]   looking at those patterns, looking at what the triggers,
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160]   you know, to see if you can see triggers for them.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.000]   And then doing lots and lots of repetitive homework,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.840]   which, and when it's successful for depression or PTSD or other venues,
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.080]   we know it actually changes brain wiring and brain chemistry.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.640]   So lots of people still think talking therapies are sort of up here doing something
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.840]   and chemicals and medications are really changing the brain.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.080]   If your thoughts are changing, if your behavior is changing,
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.440]   your brain has changed.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.480]   That's the only place that thoughts and behaviors come from.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.560]   But there have been at least two groups, Mary Salanto's in New York
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.920]   and a Harvard group by, I'm blanking on his first,
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.760]   Safran and some other, Ramsey at Pennsylvania,
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.880]   developed approaches using CBT techniques
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.240]   specifically designed for people with ADHD to help overcome some of those hurdles
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.880]   and barriers.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.400]   And both of them encourage actually the use of medications in combination with it.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.240]   Because many people with ADHD are too unfocused,
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.640]   too unable to sit down and do it.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.200]   But these are approaches and both approaches are amazingly similar,
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.080]   although devised completely independently.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.720]   At the core of both of those approaches is having a system of scheduling each day.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.440]   That doesn't mean micromanaging each minute, but it's having the essentials in place,
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.640]   having blocks of time that you know what you're going to do.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.440]   And having a task list in combination with that.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.480]   And ways of learning to prioritize and move things up or down.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.160]   And again, with ADHD being interest-driven rather than importance-driven, you may have a task.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.000]   I mean, you probably have 17 task lists.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.040]   One's New York coffee.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.720]   One's at the grocery store.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.640]   One, it's having one consolidated list, because if it's everywhere, then it's nowhere.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:39.640]   And two is the simplest triaging or organizing approach is having the things that are both
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.280]   urgent and important.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.760]   So that happens to happen today, those get in the A category.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.760]   The things that are important but aren't as urgent are the B category.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.920]   And all the other things are the C.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.720]   And one of the temptations that people with ADHD have is, oh, I need to be productive.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.680]   You know, it's fun to go buy shoelaces, and that's on my list.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.040]   So I'll go to buy shoelaces, because then I can cross something off my list.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.720]   But I didn't move the car.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.920]   I didn't do my taxes.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.440]   I haven't done my homework.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.520]   And all the important things remain undone.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.000]   So it's a system for getting done what's really needed to be done.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.680]   And eventually, if your shoes don't work, the shoelaces will move up to that.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.560]   A category.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.880]   But for most people, they're not really there.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.440]   And it's not a good use of your time to do them first.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.200]   So that-- and there's much more to it.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.760]   So the CBT approach can work with decreasing procrastination.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.080]   It can help with structuring your own workspace, given that you probably have much more trouble
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.880]   doing that and not doing it spontaneously.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.280]   It's how to eliminate distractions and modules on even extending your
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.160]   concentration time.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.560]   So the answer with the video games, there is one product that's actually been FDA approved for
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.320]   use in ADHD.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.640]   And the really important thing to remember there is the FDA's system for addressing medications
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.040]   is much more rigorous, much more thorough.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.400]   You have to demonstrate it really works and does something.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.960]   When the FDA approves devices, basically, they're saying it's not going to kill anyone.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.600]   It might help.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.560]   I mean, it might help tremendously.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.600]   But having the FDA imprimatur for that doesn't guarantee that or mean that at all.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.800]   Do you recall if the study of that device or the study of that video game has a conflict of
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.120]   interest?
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.000]   Was it run by the company?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.240]   Yeah, so almost all of them have been run by the company.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.520]   I mean, it's good people at UCSF who are at least partly involved in it.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.880]   Oh, is this Adam Gazzelli's group?
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.320]   I think so.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.720]   Yeah, I should just say that I've followed his work for some years.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.080]   He's a neuroscientist.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.360]   I know people who have been in his lab.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.920]   He's known for doing very, very high quality and stringent work.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.080]   Their product and some of the others can clearly show you get better at their product
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.360]   and you get better at tests that look exactly like their product.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.520]   But in terms of real world, how much is this really helping ADHD symptoms on a day-to-day basis?
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.240]   Not a lot of data at all.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.040]   So again, that doesn't mean it doesn't work.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.120]   And I'm going to go sideways and talking about neurofeedback because there's
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.360]   lots and lots of neurofeedback companies across the country that are making lots and lots of money.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.280]   And there was an article in the American Journal of Psychiatry in the last year.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.520]   I'm not remembering which group did it.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:49.080]   And it was another failure to find a significant impact from neurofeedback.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.640]   And again, I'm not saying it doesn't have an effect, but I've had lots of people saying,
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.320]   writing me, should I keep spending hundreds of dollars each week because my insurance isn't
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:05.800]   covering this and the doctor is saying, oh, maybe 20 more episodes will retrain your brain.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.600]   And so this gets back to a topic you brought up earlier.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.200]   How much are we retraining our brains with immersion in social media?
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.840]   And the evidence is we are rewiring our brains.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.720]   So maybe anything pushing in an opposite direction or maybe this is reinforcing some
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.480]   of the bad things we don't want.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:31.320]   it's we're in a messy world without clear answers yet.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   I've made it a point to put social media on an old phone.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.040]   So those apps are only on that phone.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.560]   I don't even know the number to that phone.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.960]   If I need to post something, I airdrop it onto that phone.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.920]   And this has helped tremendously in segregating that activity and limiting it.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.840]   It also means that people send me something which would otherwise direct me to social media.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.560]   It's much more difficult for me to go look it up.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.520]   It's helped tremendously.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.480]   I just pass it on because it's one of the things that's really allowed me to
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.000]   restrict my social media time.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.120]   And yet still be, you know, in keeping with the fact that I think social media has its uses.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.320]   I post there, et cetera.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.680]   Yes.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.360]   Getting back to the scheduling.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.080]   I mean, what I recommend to people and one of my week, I don't know the specific apps,
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.240]   but there are apps that will help shut you out of Facebook or discord or
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.080]   TikTok or whatever it is.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.120]   If you can't exert your own willpower, which again is harder to do if you have ADHD.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:35.640]   And if the app approach doesn't work, the next level up is there are all sorts of companies
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.240]   making lock boxes and physical devices where you can lock yourself out to your device for certain
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:41.960]   hours of the day.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.040]   And I think that's a good idea for lots of people.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.320]   I do too.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:53.160]   And I think it also helps, at least in my experience, to do things that are very different than social
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.040]   media as well, but still consuming content.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.840]   So I make it a point to read from an actual physical book a bit each day or night.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.800]   Also because I was raised doing that and writing by hand is just sort of in keeping with the way
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:11.480]   that my brain was wired, so maybe that's more specific to me and my generation.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:18.440]   But I find that when I'm doing those other activities, when I go onto social media,
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.400]   it feels more like a departure from the rest of life as opposed to the other way around.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:34.600]   That's a good sign for preserving.
