[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.200]   We have a lot of questions from parents of prodigals, and those parents want to walk
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.760]   wisely, as you can imagine, Pastor John.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.080]   Dennis is a father.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.600]   He writes in to us to ask this.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.120]   Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.480]   I have a 16-year-old prodigal son who has left our home and walked away from Christ.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.280]   I struggle to know whether I should generously financially support him in the world like
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:34.120]   the father in the prodigal son's story, or unlike what it seems Eli should have done,
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.560]   should I take a more strict position in relating to my rebellious son?
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.200]   The prodigal was given his inheritance.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.640]   He blew it on lewd living and returned home in repentance.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.920]   Eli's sons were wicked.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.640]   They lived in all sorts of sin that was unchecked and unrepented of, and they died for it.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.480]   Abundant grace or strict restraint?
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.000]   What should the father of a prodigal do, especially in regards to finances?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.440]   Well, I love the way he has already thought a lot about this and thought about it from
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.440]   the Scriptures.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:15.560]   And frankly, I don'tâ€”I wish I had precise and clear answers.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.720]   But let me say what I do have, and maybe the Lord will use it in some way.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.360]   One of the things that makes a relationship with a prodigal so difficult and complex is
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.720]   the interplay between passages of the Bible concerning church discipline and passages
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.560]   concerning parenting.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.400]   One of the hard church discipline issues is that on the one hand, we have a call, for
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.560]   example, not even to eat with someone who's a professing believer and living in immorality,
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.280]   and on the other hand, normal expectations of what godly parenting is that might make
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.040]   that kind of guideline very difficult to carry through.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.800]   And there are many other kinds of ambiguities as we try to sort through the special role
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.280]   of a parent in the life of a child who will not submit to his parents' authority any
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.840]   longer or doesn't believe any longer in what the parents believe.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.720]   So with regard to financial help for a prodigal, I can't see that there is just one rule
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.560]   that applies to every situation.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.240]   It seems to me that there are so many factors that make a difference.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.880]   How old is he?
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.160]   How serious is his sinful behavior?
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.960]   And what are the effects of it on others and the harmfulness of it on himself?
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.440]   Are there elements of respect remaining in his heart?
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.680]   Is there departure?
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.860]   Was his departure ugly, rebellion, or just a more honest difference of conviction?
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.920]   Is he eager to get on his own feet financially, or is he just aimless and simply mooching
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.920]   and on and on?
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.880]   The questions go that seem to me we'd have to ask.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.440]   And the reason I think these questions matter is because they are the sort of thing we have
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.160]   to ask about all of our generosity towards others, especially those who mistreat us.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.160]   I'm thinking of Jesus' words in Matthew 5:38, "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.520]   for an eye and a truth for a tooth.'
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.360]   And I say to you, do not resist the one who is evil, but if anyone slaps you on the right
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.820]   cheek, turn to him the other also.
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.720]   If anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.180]   If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.620]   Give to the one who begs from you.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.120]   Do not refuse the one who would borrow from you."
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.720]   So that's Matthew 5, 38 to 42.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.200]   And as radical as those are, and I'll circle back to that radicalness in just a minute,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.840]   it is plain that from the Bible itself that there are structures of society, seers of
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.920]   society where the Bible puts limits on those teachings.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.200]   For example, in the family, children should obey their parents and parents should discipline
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.520]   their children rather than always turning the other cheek.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.400]   In government, the state has a right to punish criminals rather than turning the other cheek.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.600]   In schools, teachers have a right to give failing grades to students who don't do their
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.920]   work.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.100]   In businesses, employers have the right to see that employees fulfill their expectations
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.700]   in order to earn their salary, otherwise they could lose their jobs.
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.560]   In the church, people can be excommunicated.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:03.360]   But when all those spheres of life are taken into consideration, Jesus did mean something
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.840]   radical when he said, "If someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.840]   also."
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.760]   And when he said, "Give to the one who begs from you."
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.200]   So the older I get, the more inclined I am to take those commands more literally than
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.120]   I once tried to justify myself in not doing.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.600]   So I don't think there is a simple rule that will dictate when you help a prodigal financially
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.480]   and when you don't.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.240]   On the one hand, you want to show the child that Jesus is your all-satisfying treasure.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.900]   And any withholding of money, which might be wise in any given situation, it might be
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:53.680]   wise, is not owing to stinginess or fear or greed or insecurity.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.240]   It's owing to a desire to do the child good.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.440]   We want him to see that.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:06.160]   And that would mean that parents would look for other ways to continually do good to the
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.160]   child.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.300]   I think that's a significant principle, that if you have to say no in one area because
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:19.520]   the child's expectation is harmful as you see it, you try to help him see your heart
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.920]   is still there for him by pouring yourself out in other ways.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.000]   You'll continually reach out to him rather than write him off.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.440]   You'll continually offer yourselves, even if you don't offer your money, and that may
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.520]   be much more difficult.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:43.120]   I mean, to get on a plane and go across the country might be much more difficult than
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.100]   wiring money.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.680]   You will go out of your way to be there for the child.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:58.160]   And yes, at some utterly surprising moment, you may give him a wonderful gift that is
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:05.200]   not designed to advance his sin, but lavish him with grace in the hopes that God might
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.760]   open his eyes.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:16.240]   But above all, I would just say to this parent, immerse yourself in the Word of God and join
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:24.620]   hands with your spouse in continual prayer for wisdom and love and boldness and even
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.940]   joy while your heart is breaking.
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.180]   And I think God, out of that, will show you the way forward.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.180]   Yes.
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.140]   Joy in the sorrow.
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.900]   A lot of wisdom to pray for in these situations.
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, for working through this question.
