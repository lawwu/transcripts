[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   Why do you exist?
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.520]   Why do I exist?
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.100]   That's the question we kick the week off with, and it comes from a regular
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.840]   listener to the podcast named Tyler, a young Christian, and Pastor
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.560]   John joins us over the phone.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.640]   Pastor John, hello, and thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.360]   I found that I flourish in almost anything when I understand the big picture.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.600]   When this is true, I understand the why behind everything I'm
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.200]   doing and where I'm going.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.160]   Unfortunately, as I'm now laying the foundations for the rest of my life as a
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.760]   Christian, all too often I find myself asking why and not getting an answer.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.400]   It seems that every sermon at church and every lesson from fellow believers is
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.940]   quote unquote, in the weeds of immediate life application, and doesn't relate
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.960]   back to the larger storyline of God's purposes and creation and recreation.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.800]   So what is the overarching concept for my life, my reason for existence
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.320]   and relationship with God?
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.960]   I know if I better understand this, I could dive into the details and perform
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.120]   them more effectively and more joyfully within this larger context.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.540]   Pastor John, what would you say to Tyler?
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.600]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.540]   That's exactly the way I think about it.
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.280]   Tyler and I are wired very similarly, it seems.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.500]   Actually, I think all human beings are wired this way, only some feel it
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.340]   more consciously than others.
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.020]   I think we're all made to find our significance by being
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.660]   attached to the ultimate.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:44.780]   So all human beings are created to attach their tiny little lives to
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.200]   something absolutely majestic and glorious so that their life takes on a
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.320]   sense of wonder and eternal significance, not because of who or what we are in
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.360]   ourselves, but because of how we're attached to and participate in the life
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.920]   and purposes of the creator of the universe.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.040]   So yes, yes, yes.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.840]   Amen.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.880]   Tyler.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.720]   Oh, how I remember the tumultuous and wonderful days between 1968 and
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:23.520]   1971 when my world was being rebuilt, destroyed and rebuilt by an
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.640]   understanding of the overarching sovereign purposes of God to be
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.840]   glorified in this world.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.640]   It was a kind of Copernican revolution to read Jonathan Edwards, the end for
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.480]   which God created the world, or to read Daniel Fuller's distillation of that
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.560]   book in his unpublished class syllabus called the unity of the Bible with the
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.760]   glory of God at its center, or to read his essay in a collection called things
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.080]   most surely believed by the faculty of Fuller Seminary, in which he gave an
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.840]   exposition of Isaiah 43, six and seven.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.160]   Bring my sons from afar, my daughters from the ends of the earth, everyone who
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:19.000]   is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.560]   I remember reading that chapter and feeling, Oh God, this is awesome.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:33.200]   Now, what was new about this for me was not that I was to live for the glory of
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.040]   God, I mean, my mother and my father continually quoted for me, first
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.120]   Corinthians 10 31, Johnny, whatever you do with the eater, drink, do all to the
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.760]   glory of God.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:55.360]   I knew that was my duty, but what I had not seen was that this was God's design
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.720]   for himself, not just my duty toward him.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:08.800]   God's purpose in creating the universe was that he would glorify himself in all
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.760]   that he does in creation and providence and redemption, all that he ever did.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.760]   He does for his own glory.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:25.560]   He obeys first Corinthians 10 31 as the reason for his very existence, because
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.320]   he's built into his nature as the sovereign God.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.720]   This was the great ultimate purpose of all things.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.240]   It wasn't just my duty.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.200]   It was the grand design of the universe.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:46.080]   I remember kneeling with Noel and our beat up old used couch in our brand new
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.400]   home is newlyweds in Pasadena.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.720]   As I was learning these things, I remember kneeling in prayer with her and
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:00.760]   turning to her and saying, isn't is amazing how our prayers have changed as
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:08.040]   we are discovering what we're saying when we say, hallowed be your name.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:17.000]   I just think I, I, I mouthed that prayer without realizing I am calling upon the
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.840]   living God to fulfill his ultimate purpose for the universe in bringing all
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:32.320]   things to reverence and treasure and glorify and value his name above all
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.200]   things.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   And that's what happens when, when your universe is being turned upside down.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.800]   One of the first evidences is in your prayer life and how everything now is
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.560]   revolving around the prayer.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.320]   Do your great purpose, glorify your great name, hallow yourself, do your will,
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.240]   bring your kingdom.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.000]   You're the center, make it happen instead of just me, me, me, me, me.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.720]   And I recall how my own sense of calling to the ministry of the word took on a
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.720]   clear purpose in the light of Philippians one 20.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:15.040]   Um, it is my eager expectation, Paul said, and my hope that I will not at all be
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:24.960]   ashamed, but that with full courage now is always Christ will be magnified in my
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.240]   body, whether by life or by death.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:36.680]   Oh, so I, I wasn't just arbitrarily pulling out of the Bible a purpose for my
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.240]   life.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:43.360]   I was being swept up into the grand purpose of the universe, which, which Paul
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.000]   himself was part of.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.920]   He, he had drawn it down from God's great glorious purpose for creation and
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.440]   redemption.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.120]   He'd made it part of his life and said, whether I live or whether I die, I have
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.960]   one passion, magnify Jesus.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:06.080]   In other words, live to make Christ look magnificent.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:14.720]   Almost everything I've done in the last 50 years has been a working out of what
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.960]   it means that God created the universe for his glory.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:29.480]   And the greatness of being human is to join him in that eternal purpose.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.520]   This is where Christian hedonism came from.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.600]   This is where the sovereignty of God finds its root and meaning.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.520]   This is where the meaning of worship is rooted.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.680]   The ministry of the word is rooted.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.480]   Global missions is rooted.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.200]   Acts of justice are rooted.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.920]   Sacrifices of marriage are rooted.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.160]   Routines of daily work get their meaning here.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:59.200]   Everything else find their ground and their significance in God's purpose to
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:07.040]   create and do all acts of providence and all acts of redemption for his glory.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.080]   So I want to say to Tyler, yes, yes, yes.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:16.520]   You will be able to dive into the painful and happy particulars of your life if you
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.120]   keep in view this great overarching purpose.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:31.960]   And that purpose is to live in such a way as to make the surpassing worth of God in
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.000]   Christ look like what it really is.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.960]   To live in such a way as to make the infinite value of Jesus more plain than if
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.600]   you had not lived.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:51.000]   This doesn't answer all the detailed questions of ethics in our lives.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:58.080]   But it does give direction for how to pray and how to meditate and how to pursue
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.360]   God's wisdom in the in the world, in our daily life.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:09.200]   So, Tyler, let me just give you those three passages again, because they made all the
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.200]   difference in my life.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.680]   Isaiah 43, 7, that God created you for his glory, created everything for his glory.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.880]   This is the great overarching purpose for you and everything else.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.960]   Philippians 1, 20, where Paul says whether he lives or dies, he does everything for the
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:32.360]   goal of magnifying Jesus Christ, showing his supreme value over everything.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.800]   And then finally, Father, hallowed be your name.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.400]   Crying out to God every day.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.480]   I'm doing this at 71 years old.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.120]   I'm crying out to God every day.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:52.640]   Oh, please let the last decade or whatever of my life be a greater, greater than ever
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.720]   magnifying of your supreme value.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.280]   This is the great unifying vision of human life.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:07.960]   And may the Lord make it clear to you and free you from any sense of wasting your life.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.960]   Glorious.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.520]   This is what we're all about.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.920]   This is the point of your life, Tyler.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.160]   Your joy, our joy, the glory of God, and the purpose of this little podcast all wrapped
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.440]   together into one end in this universe that God is most glorified in us when we are most
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.280]   satisfied in him.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.840]   Oh, beautiful.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.000]   This is the unwasted life.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.040]   There's so much to chew on in this episode, but if you want even more to chew on, visit our

[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:03.240]   So what are the three most common threats to the joy of this current generation of
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.000]   believers?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.520]   Where is our joy made susceptible?
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.600]   It's a question on Wednesday.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.000]   Wow.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.160]   Another great question coming from you, the audience.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.760]   Keep them coming.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.800]   Thanks for sending those in.

[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:28.240]   [inaudible].
