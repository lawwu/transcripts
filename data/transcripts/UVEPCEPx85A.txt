[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:15.680]   New passions, new affections produce new conduct.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.720]   And if you try to turn it around,
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.480]   you don't have Christianity anymore.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.320]   I'm a Christian hedonist for theological reasons.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.600]   I am after people's affections, their hearts, their emotions,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.640]   their feelings, because all of our behaviors come from this.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.280]   There may be a few behaviors that you
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.400]   do by dint of willpower against your passions, very few.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.680]   99% of what you do is out of the abundance of the heart,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.400]   the mouth speaks, and the arms move, and you live.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.600]   Therefore, the number one issue in life
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.720]   is having new passions.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.920]   As obedient children, that's what we want to be,
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.240]   children of God, as obedient children,
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.880]   we should not be formed.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.400]   Don't be conformed to this world, be transformed.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.440]   We should not be formed, conformed to passions
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.480]   that were rooted in ignorance.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.560]   So we're spending five hours together
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.760]   trying to banish ignorance, increase knowledge,
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.040]   awaken passions, new conduct, Vancouver sees,
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.040]   and gives glory to God.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.320]   That's 1 Peter.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.240]   Just said it, we can all go home now.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.040]   That was the summary.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.360]   Hope, totally replacing all the passions that drive you
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.160]   into sin, according to ignorance, new passions,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.240]   new hopes, new joy, inexpressible, overflowing,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:11.320]   full of glory, producing holy in all your conduct.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.360]   Since it is written, you should be holy, for I am holy.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.800]   God does not come to you and say, OK, holiness
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.680]   is what I want from you.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.600]   All right?
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.840]   And here's some things that are going to be holy.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.640]   You don't sleep with her anymore until you're married.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.000]   And you're not going to get drunk on the weekends.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.880]   And you're just going to stop stealing.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.920]   And you're not going to lie anymore.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.800]   OK, let's get about it.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.000]   That's just totally not Christianity.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.520]   He comes to you and spends 12 verses saying,
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.040]   do you see the hope that you have?
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.720]   Do you see the inheritance?
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.600]   Do you see how it's imperishable and undefiled?
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.000]   Do you see how God is keeping you for it?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.720]   Do you see how he is putting you through fire
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.800]   in order to make it precious so that you receive glory
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   and praise and honor?
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.960]   Do you see that?
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.320]   Do you have knowledge now?
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.880]   If you do, you've got some new passions.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.800]   And these old ones, these old ones right here,
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.640]   they're not going to govern you anymore.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.440]   And therefore, your conduct will be holy.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.200]   Holiness is three steps out.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.120]   Knowledge, gird up the loins of your mind, be sober,
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.880]   see the world as it really is.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.880]   See eternity.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.320]   See the value of the hope.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.200]   Feel new passions.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.960]   Do new conduct.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.160]   That's Christianity.
