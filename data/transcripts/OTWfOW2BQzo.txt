[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.240]   Good Monday, it's a big week for us in the podcast
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.760]   with two hot topics on the table.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.680]   I'll put them back to back
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.760]   because they're related to one another.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.120]   Both are very relevant for this season in church life
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.240]   where social media plays a large role in our culture,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.040]   or at least it seems like it plays a large role
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.280]   in our culture.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.260]   Thursday, we're gonna look at how to best speak
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.880]   of cultural sins or how to not speak of cultural sins.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.880]   Paul tells us some things are so wicked,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.580]   they are too shameful even to speak of.
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.680]   He says that in Ephesians 5, 12.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.640]   So what cultural sins should we not even talk about?
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.320]   And what does Paul mean here in this text?
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.520]   And why does it matter for us today?
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.160]   That's next time on Thursday.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.180]   But today we look at the sick love of controversy
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.600]   or the unhealthy craving for controversy
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.700]   as Paul calls it in 1 Timothy 6, 4.
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.240]   The question is from a podcast listener named Brett.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.520]   Pastor John, hello, we live in an age of controversy
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.200]   and that controversy loving spirit
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.840]   has come into the church.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.080]   The apostle Paul clearly warns us
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.040]   against people in the church who have a diseased
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.080]   or unhealthy craving for controversy
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.560]   and for quarrels about words,
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.840]   which produce envy, dissension, slander,
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.160]   evil suspicions and constant friction
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.480]   among people who are depraved in mind
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.440]   and deprived of the truth,
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.980]   imagining that godliness is a means of gain.
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.560]   That's 1 Timothy 6, verses four to five.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.840]   I'm wondering if you can lay out principles
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.000]   for what this diseased craving for controversy looks like
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.220]   in the church today.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.640]   - I'll try to do that in just a moment.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880]   I'm gonna lay out some principles
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.880]   to try to avoid what Paul's denouncing in these verses.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.240]   But first, let me say a word about
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.260]   what Brett calls our age of controversy.
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.280]   He's right, of course,
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.400]   but we probably shouldn't forget
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.560]   that even in our own country,
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.560]   the bygone centuries have been just as,
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.640]   if not more given to vitriolic language in controversy.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.680]   And the reason I say that is just
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.480]   'cause it's on my front burner
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.920]   because I'm reading biographies.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.680]   In the last, say, six months,
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.440]   I've read biographies of John Marshall,
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.320]   first Supreme Court Justice,
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.600]   Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Samuel Adams,
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.680]   and what you can't help but notice
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.680]   in these really detailed, excellent scholarly biographies
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.080]   is how outrageous the defamation of character was
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.360]   in the political writings of that time.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.360]   I mean, the language is every bit as vitriolic and lewd
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.480]   as the language we might be appalled at today.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.260]   So that's the first thing to say
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.260]   is that the age of controversy is not new.
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.560]   What gives this age, our present age,
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.560]   a new flavor is first how ubiquitous social media is
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.500]   so that we have immediate access
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.240]   to as much vitriol as we would like,
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.240]   and second, the excesses of sexual sin in our day
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.200]   are in American history unprecedented and outrageous,
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   like so-called gay marriage and so-called transgenderism
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.280]   and so-called healthcare as we cut our babies in pieces.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.980]   And the reason I put the term so-called
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.640]   in front of those phrases is because they don't really exist
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.320]   and we should not even dignify them as Christians
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.600]   with language that gives the impression they do exist.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.640]   I get really worked up about this.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.280]   Some of my good friends have caved on the language issue.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.920]   There's no such thing as a marriage
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.560]   between two men or two women.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.720]   It does not exist.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.840]   There's no such thing as a man becoming a woman
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.320]   or a woman becoming a man.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.880]   It does not happen.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.320]   There's no such thing as healthcare,
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.560]   which consists in killing unborn children.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.240]   Those are simply not realities.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.520]   Naming them marriage, transgender, healthcare
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.920]   does not make them what they aren't.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.840]   And these are just some of the kinds of sins
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.640]   that are rampant in our day,
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.000]   not to mention the love of money
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.040]   that has probably sent more people to hell
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.040]   than all the sexual sins combined
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.840]   and racial sins and nationalistic and ethnocentric sins
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.320]   and epidemics of the misuse of drugs
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.600]   and on and on and on for our age.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.360]   So every local church,
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.120]   I am getting to the issue of controversy in the church.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.960]   I'm getting there.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   Every local church needs to affirm its biblical stance
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.560]   over against these sins.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.280]   For example, at our church, Bethlehem Baptist Church,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.760]   the elders labored long and hard in recent years
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.720]   over two extended statements
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.120]   regarding race and regarding sexuality.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.760]   And in my judgment,
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.080]   they produced two very helpful documents,
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.240]   which our church and our school,
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.360]   Bethlehem College and Seminary,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.840]   happily embraced as where we stand.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.040]   In other words, the leadership of the church
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.360]   shouldn't leave their people wondering,
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.120]   where does the church stand
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.760]   in regard to these controversial things in our day?
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.920]   But now comes the rub that Brett is talking about.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.800]   Within our churches,
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.680]   even the clearest and the most forthright churches
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.920]   that have driven a stake in the ground,
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.680]   people have different dispositions and different instincts
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.680]   and different personalities,
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.880]   which incline them in different directions
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.520]   concerning how frequently and how fervently
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.520]   and how forcefully and how harshly and how crudely
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.200]   cultural issues should be talked about,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.480]   should be foregrounded inside and outside the church.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.240]   Some of these differences are quite manageable,
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.920]   and we just need to have forbearance and patience
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.260]   and forgiveness in order to get along
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.080]   with each other in love.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.840]   But Paul, in these verses, in 1 Timothy 6,
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.880]   says there's a limit.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.540]   There's a limit to how you talk about these things.
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.540]   There is a love of controversy that needs to be rebuked
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.960]   and, if necessary, removed.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.060]   Here's what he says.
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.200]   This is 1 Timothy 6, 4 and 5.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.960]   The person he's concerned about is, quote,
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.960]   "puffed up with conceit and understands nothing."
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.040]   He has an unhealthy, literally sick,
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.680]   he has a sick craving for controversy
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.320]   and for quarrels about words or word fights,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.400]   which produce envy, strife, slander,
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.540]   evil suspicions or conjectures about other people,
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.760]   and constant friction among people
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.800]   who are depraved in mind and deprived of truth,
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.400]   imagining that godliness is a means of gain.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.900]   Now, what I think will be useful as a diagnostic tool,
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.960]   first for ourselves, are we guilty of this?
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.000]   Lest we fall into this.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And a diagnostic tool for others
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.240]   is to take these traits that he just described
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.560]   of this controversy-loving person
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.240]   and state the positive alternatives.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.920]   And in that way, we can have something to pray toward
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.520]   as well as something to run away from,
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.520]   and we may be able to see the problems
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.840]   of others and ourselves more clearly.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.600]   So let me do that just briefly.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.240]   Seems to me there are six traits
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.400]   of this lover of controversy
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.500]   that we can name and strive to avoid.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.440]   One, pride.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.240]   He's puffed up with conceit, Paul says.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.060]   The positive alternative, of course, is humility,
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.240]   or more specifically, a readiness to confess
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.920]   our limitations of knowledge
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.800]   and our willingness to go on learning.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.680]   If a person comes off as cocky
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.800]   and acting like he has infallibility,
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.440]   never makes any mistakes,
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.960]   you know you're going to have a problem.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.200]   We need to cultivate in the church
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.200]   the profound belief that a person can be rock solid,
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.020]   unwavering on matters of clear biblical truth
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:48.020]   and justice and purity while maintaining a humble demeanor.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.080]   There are people, a lot of people, it seems today,
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.240]   who don't believe that.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:58.880]   They think the only way to be a person of backbone
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.200]   is to be brash.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.200]   I don't think that's true.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.040]   Number two, the second trait
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   of this lover of controversy is ignorance.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.000]   Paul says he doesn't understand anything.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.200]   Now, I take that to mean that when our heart is infected
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.620]   with this sickness of the love of controversy
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:26.220]   and with pride, even the facts that we get right
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.080]   will be skewed in a damaging direction
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.380]   so that it can be said,
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.800]   we really don't understand anything.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.440]   We don't get anything right.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.900]   We turn everything in a harmful direction.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.060]   Third, Paul says this person has a kind of sickness,
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.780]   the ESV translate unhealthy,
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.020]   craving for controversy and word fights.
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:53.020]   There are people who have a morbid need to fight,
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:11:00.900]   a need to fight in order to feel significant,
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.260]   to feel justified, to feel safe.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:08.320]   We need discernment to recognize this kind of person.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.320]   One way is to test whether there is as much praising
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.100]   and thanking and rejoicing
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.660]   as there is criticizing and complaining.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.380]   Does the person love to see the beauties of God
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.560]   and Christ and salvation and heaven
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.220]   and speak of them with joy and marveling?
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:38.520]   Or does his need for a fight hinder all of that?
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.420]   If so, he's not well.
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.780]   He's just not spiritually well.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.540]   He needs help.
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.440]   Fourth, this person stirs up envy.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.060]   This can happen in different ways,
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.960]   but one way is that lovers of controversy
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.540]   like to show off their verbal prowess,
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.720]   clever put downs, shrewd analyses
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.520]   of other person's stupidity,
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.580]   ready wit, and a nimble use of culturally hip allusions.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.300]   All of this, with a view to showing off,
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:20.140]   tends to make other immature people wish they could do that.
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.180]   That's called envy.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.780]   Fifth, this controversy-loving person
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.740]   is careless with the truth.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:32.740]   Paul says he uses slander, evil suspicions or conjectures.
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.100]   This usually means he's ready to believe evil of others
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.740]   with very little evidence.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.740]   His anger at a viewpoint, which may be totally justified,
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:51.540]   causes a bias that is so strong it ceases to need truth,
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.420]   but only needs to show the insanity of the viewpoint.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:02.220]   In the process, holding one right position
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.020]   can easily be used to justify saying other things
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.480]   that are not true.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.060]   We need to love the truth
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.140]   through and through with great earnestness.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.260]   And then finally, sixth,
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.740]   Paul says that this lover of controversy
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.120]   imagines that godliness is a means of gain.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.840]   In other words, deep down, he loves money,
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.940]   which Paul says later is the root of all evil.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.300]   Which I take to mean the heart that values this world,
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.420]   what money can buy, over Christ,
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:46.420]   is the kind of heart from which all evils come.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.420]   It is.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:53.420]   Money is just the lever that such a heart pulls
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.100]   in order to get what they really want,
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.300]   which is not supremely Christ.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:04.300]   So I think if we mainly seek to be the opposite
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:09.120]   of this lover of controversy, in these six ways,
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.060]   we will probably be in a good position
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.660]   both to recognize the error when we see it
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:20.060]   and in a good position to avoid it ourselves.
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:20.900]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.720]   Is there as much praising and thanking and rejoicing
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.020]   as there is criticizing and complaining?
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:30.260]   Such a great litmus test on our tongues.
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.660]   And this reminds me of Ephesians chapter five, verse four,
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.220]   a text that we have talked about many times on this podcast.
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.480]   Paul wants us to clean up the crudeness of our tongues
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.580]   with thanksgiving.
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.460]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.280]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.740]   If you want to ask Pastor John, email us your question
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.920]   by going to our online home at askpastorjohn.com.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.740]   Well, speaking of a culture of sin
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.980]   and speaking of Ephesians five,
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.340]   specifically in verse 12,
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.940]   Paul tells us that there are some things in this world
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.740]   that are so wicked, so shameful,
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.560]   that we Christians shouldn't even speak about them.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.540]   So what cultural sins are so shameful,
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.520]   we are not even to talk about them?
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.060]   That's next time.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.380]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.140]   We'll see you back here on Thursday.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:33.300]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
