[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460]   [Silence]
[00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.380]   Now, breathing and respiration is an enormous topic
[00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.220]   in and of itself.
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.460]   And in fact, I did an entire episode
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.780]   on breathing and respiration.
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.720]   And this is a topic that my laboratory works on extensively
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.960]   as it relates to anxiety control
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.060]   and some other aspects of mental health,
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.220]   as well as to physical performance.
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.120]   For today's discussion,
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.460]   I want to just review a few tools that one can incorporate
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.540]   both into workouts and around workouts
[00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.900]   that can greatly enhance fitness and recovery.
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.320]   The first one is the type of respiration tool
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.540]   that you use between sets of exercise.
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.480]   And again, here, we're talking about resistance training,
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.220]   but we could just as easily be talking about
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.540]   rest between rounds of say high-intensity interval training.
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.400]   So for instance, between bouts of sprinting on the track
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.620]   or the bike or the treadmill or the rower.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.860]   A great pattern of breathing to incorporate
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.780]   during rest between sets
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.220]   is something that I've talked about before in other contexts,
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.780]   which is the physiological side.
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.100]   The physiological side is a deep inhale through the nose
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.180]   to maximally or near maximally inflate your lungs.
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.980]   And then a second, very brief inhale,
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.540]   and it's necessarily brief
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.600]   'cause your lungs are already pretty full,
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.140]   to maximally inflate your lungs
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.100]   and to make sure that any of the little sacks,
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.260]   the little alveoli of your lungs that have collapsed
[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.180]   during the exercise exertion will reinflate.
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.520]   And then a long exhale until lungs empty.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.140]   So I'll demonstrate it right now
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.340]   as I've done many times before,
[00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.340]   but if you haven't seen it or heard it before,
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.100]   it's two inhales followed by an extended exhale
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.260]   and it goes like this.
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.420]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.860]   You'll notice that the inhales were through the nose
[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.660]   and the exhale was through the mouth.
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.300]   That's the ideal way to do it for a number of reasons.
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.700]   Check out the episode that I did on respiration physiology,
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.840]   aka breathing, if you want more details on why that is.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.280]   But two inhales through the nose
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.320]   and a long extended exhale through the mouth,
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.880]   the so-called physiological side, not named by me,
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.760]   but rather named by physiologists in the 1930s,
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.120]   is as far as we know, the fastest way
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.360]   to shift your nervous system from so-called sympathetic drive
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.220]   to more parasympathetic drive,
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.820]   from a state of greater alertness
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.920]   to a state of greater calm.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.920]   Now, the reason to do this between sets of resistance
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.840]   training is that the more that you can shift yourself
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.040]   from sympathetic drive to parasympathetic drive,
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.720]   that is from alert to calm in between sets,
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.560]   the more energy and focus you can devote to exertion
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.160]   during your work sets.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.000]   Okay, so one way to do this that's very convenient
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.960]   and very effective is to consider the last repetition
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.880]   of your set, a physiological side, which is not to say,
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.840]   okay, I want to be very clear,
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.060]   which is not to say that you should do
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.880]   the physiological side during your set.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.520]   In fact, I recommend you do not do that,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.720]   but rather if you're doing six repetitions
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.460]   of a given exercise, and you, let's say, fail on the sixth,
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.880]   or you do that sixth repetition,
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.480]   and you're just close to failure, 'cause again,
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.720]   your work set should be to failure or close to it
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.200]   most of the time, then set down the weight,
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.040]   and then you're going to do the next repetition
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.720]   as the physiological side,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.480]   meaning you're not going to do the movement,
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.120]   you're going to think of doing a physiological side
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.880]   as the last repetition of every set,
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.760]   not during the last repetition
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.880]   of the resistance training movement, okay?
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.520]   So the physiological side is something you do
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.800]   at the beginning of the rest period,
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.180]   immediately following a set.
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.360]   If you'd rather think about it that way,
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.920]   because it's more convenient than thinking about it
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.960]   as the last rep of a set, be my guest,
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.740]   whatever works for you, but what you'll quickly find
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.340]   is that if you do a physiological side
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.580]   right after completing your last repetition,
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.980]   you'll calm down much more quickly,
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.960]   your heart rate will come down more quickly,
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.680]   and you'll recover more completely
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.560]   in whatever designated rest period you've allowed yourself,
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.840]   whether or not it's 30 seconds,
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.440]   which would be very short, frankly,
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.040]   or it's a five-minute period of rest between sets.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.360]   If you do one, truly, just one physiological side
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.480]   at the beginning of the rest period,
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.600]   you are going to effectively shift your nervous system
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.120]   in the direction you want it to go
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.600]   during those rest periods.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.960]   And of course, if you're training hard
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.260]   during your work sets, you run zero risk whatsoever
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.480]   of feeling so calm that you don't feel motivated
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.720]   to do your next set.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.400]   I promise you that it will allow you to relax more
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.140]   at the beginning of the rest period
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.600]   than you ordinarily would.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.720]   To shift into a state of rest,
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.800]   there are differing opinions about whether or not
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.600]   you should walk around or stay still
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.480]   during your rest periods.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.240]   I like to walk around a bit and stay standing.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.000]   I'm not one of these people that kind of collapses
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.240]   into a C-shape on the bench in between sets.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.520]   I like to stand up and, you know, breathe normally,
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.200]   walk around, drink a little water, et cetera.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.400]   In any case, doing a physiological side
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.380]   at the beginning of each rest interval
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.040]   between work sets of resistance training
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.960]   is a very effective way to enhance your focus
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.040]   and your output during your work sets.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.880]   (upbeat music)
