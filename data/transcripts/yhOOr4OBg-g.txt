[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.080]   - Pastor John, you were in the process
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.200]   of moving to Tennessee the week
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.660]   of the Moore, Oklahoma tornado.
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.840]   And in the last podcast, we talked about the pastoral side
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.400]   of why you address natural disasters.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.900]   In this episode, I want to address those
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.220]   who agree with your theology.
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.620]   They agree that God ordains all that comes to pass,
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.000]   even a category five tornado for the millions
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.220]   of good and glorious ripple effects
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.960]   that will ultimately result because of this tragedy.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.140]   But they disagree with your timing.
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.420]   When you write blogs or post Twitter updates
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.920]   in the midst of the destruction,
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.320]   what would you say to these individuals?
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.280]   - Right, that's a good question.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.960]   So let me give just a bigger picture
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.880]   and then I'll be very specific in the way
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.040]   to answer that question about how I feel
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.320]   about those couple of tweets and that timing.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.300]   There are at least four reasons as I've thought about this,
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.560]   why people might oppose saying something
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.300]   about the sovereignty and goodness of God
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.560]   in the midst of calamity.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.240]   Number one, they just don't agree with it.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.820]   And you're not addressing that person,
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.700]   but I'm gonna mention that person anyway.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.820]   They don't agree with it.
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.380]   They don't think God is sovereign in the sense
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.380]   that he's ruling the wind and governing nature
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.160]   so that who is killed and who's not killed
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.440]   is decided ultimately by God.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.360]   They just don't believe that.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.360]   I heard a sermon recently that said that explicitly.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.560]   That this world is cursed, the pastor said,
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.040]   which of course is true.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.960]   It's replaced the creative world with a cursed world.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.160]   And all those bad things are owing to the curse.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.460]   Well, my answer to that is yes, they are.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.520]   And God is the one who subjected the world to futility.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.200]   And not only that, he didn't just do it like a clockmaker
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.700]   who said, okay, I'm gonna make this clock go bad now.
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.340]   And then steps back and watches the clock go bad.
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.060]   He is involved in nature, as the Bible says,
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.200]   everywhere repeatedly governing the natural processes
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.060]   like Jesus stopping the storm so that the disciples say,
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.560]   well, who then is this who rules,
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.040]   who commands the winds and the waves and they obey him,
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.800]   which he does in Oklahoma as well as Israel.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.640]   So that's first.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.280]   They might just disagree entirely
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.120]   with my view of God's sovereignty.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.120]   Number two, they might think that the way you say it
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.720]   is helpful or unhelpful.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.960]   So you might say, you might choose language like,
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.860]   God killed your children, that's really harsh.
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.480]   Or you might say, God took your children,
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.800]   that's a little softer.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   Or you might say, your children are gone
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.040]   and God is still sovereign.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.240]   You hear the different flavors and nuances
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.520]   in each of those.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.720]   It's how you say things really matters.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.280]   So what I said, the two tweets that I tweeted were,
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.240]   number one, I quoted Job 119,
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.680]   your sons and daughters were eating
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.360]   and a great wind struck the house and it fell upon them
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.040]   and they are dead.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.340]   And what I meant and hoped by that would be
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.820]   that the raw biblical statement that it happened to Job
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.100]   who was blameless and upright and feared God
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.660]   and turned away from evil and was not a bad man,
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.100]   that it happened to him is that we would all say,
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.080]   there it did, it's again, again, again, they're dead,
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.660]   they're dead, it happened to Job, it happened to us.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.020]   Oh God, how long?
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.580]   In other words, just the raw factuality was expressed.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.260]   And then secondly, five minutes later,
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.820]   I tweeted, then Job rose, this is Job 120,
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.060]   Jen Job rose, tore his robe, shaved his head,
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.820]   fell on the ground and worshiped.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.620]   And my heart in this was,
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.640]   this is what parents are doing in Moore, Oklahoma.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.500]   They're not discussing, they're not preaching,
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.580]   they're not reading books, they're tearing their hair out.
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.920]   They're pulling on their clothes,
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.260]   they're falling on the ground and weeping their eyes out.
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.220]   And by grace, many of them are worshiping as they weep.
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.380]   That was the gist,
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.740]   that was the point of trying to just say
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.060]   what I believed was happening for many.
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.660]   And I know Tony beyond the shadow of doubt
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.420]   that weeping and worshiping go together.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.340]   I've experienced it, I've watched people experience it,
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.420]   Job experienced it, so that's number two.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.940]   A person might simply say, you didn't say it helpfully.
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.740]   Third, the timing might be off.
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.420]   That's the one you mentioned.
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.260]   And surely that's a crucial consideration.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.220]   I mean, that's why Ecclesiastes 3 is written, right?
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.940]   For everything there is a season,
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.660]   a time to be born, a time to die, a time to weep,
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.280]   a time to laugh, a time to mourn, a time to dance.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.220]   And if you get it wrong, you can really be hurtful.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.580]   And the last one is a person might disagree
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.060]   or disapprove of what you say
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.860]   because the medium is just not the right place.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.780]   In other words, Twitter is just not a good medium
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.220]   that can bear the weight of such serious issues.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.780]   I think some people would say that.
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.020]   So looking back, here's my answer to your question.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.300]   Looking back, especially on those last three,
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.220]   the way you say it, the time you say it,
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.340]   the medium you say it,
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.700]   I wish that those three had been perceived by me
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.860]   differently than I perceive them in the moment.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.860]   I think the way I said it was fairly raw
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.180]   and I get help from that, but not everybody does.
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.020]   The timing was immediate.
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.500]   It was 11 o'clock that night and the medium was risky,
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.060]   Twitter, because you can't hear any tone of voice,
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.140]   you can't get a broader explanation.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.460]   It finds people in situations that are all over the map.
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.820]   So while I love the truth that I spoke
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.500]   and I believe in it with all my heart
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.700]   and it gives me help in the midst of my calamity
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.780]   and gives many people help,
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.620]   I think that was a misjudgment on my part
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.980]   and I'm sorry that I did it.
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.700]   I pulled them down, but I pulled them down way too late
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.020]   and so it caused all the ruckus that it did
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.900]   and I just hope the Lord will take all that
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.700]   and turn it for good.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.940]   I'm sure that this will happen again.
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.780]   That is, I hope that I won't judge
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.860]   and then misjudge, I mean misjudge
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.340]   and then pull things down again.
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.900]   I hope I can avoid that.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.260]   Oh, by the way, there's another lesson I learned.
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.660]   I mean, I knew it, but this taught me it.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.620]   I don't think Twitter is ever designed
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.660]   to do tweets back to back.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.180]   That's just a bad idea.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.260]   I blew it when I said, okay, I'll get the people
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.180]   to understand tweet number one by reading tweet number two.
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.860]   The medium is not designed for that.
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.420]   I think the reason I tweet is because I think God himself
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.980]   is a tweeter in the book of Proverbs
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.980]   and that he means for those Proverbs to be self-standing
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.180]   and if you can't make yourself relatively clearly understood
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.060]   or appropriately provocative in one tweet,
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.340]   you better just not tweet.
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.820]   You better use a blog or something else.
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.900]   So I think I made a big mistake in trying to put two
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.500]   back to back and hoping they would be coherent
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.940]   and of course people can separate them out
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.780]   and then that doesn't work anymore.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.180]   - Thank you, Pastor John, for addressing these topics
