[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300]   [Music]
[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.300]   This is a question from Justin who asks a really sharp one.
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.300]   "Pastor John, we are told Jesus was tempted and that he can sympathize with our temptations as a result.
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.300]   But doesn't it seem like the point of commonality between my temptations and Jesus's temptations is external?
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.800]   That is, the devil offered him the kingdoms, someone could walk up to me and offer me stolen money.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.800]   Both of these are external temptations, even if they don't personally draw us into evil.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.800]   But with a Christian, temptations seem deeper on account of indwelling sin, which of course Jesus never had.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.800]   So can Jesus really identify with me when he doesn't know the experience of indwelling sin, raging war against the Spirit?
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.800]   Aren't our temptations more powerful than those faced by Christ on earth?"
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   Wow. Oh my, is that a good question. That is a good and hard question.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.800]   So I'm going to give the answer, the answer as I see it anyway, in a sentence,
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.800]   and then I'm going to dig in and try to explain where it came from.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:20.800]   Jesus identifies with us to the greatest degree possible that is good for us.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.800]   If he went beyond that, he would not be helpful or loving.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:39.800]   If Jesus identified with you or me by sharing in my indwelling sin, he would cease to be a great high priest.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:49.800]   He would be like me and you and other high priests who had to offer sacrifices for their own sins and for the sins of others,
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   and he cannot save.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   He would have to cease being a savior if he shared in my indwelling sin, if he joined me in my sinfulness.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   The only good he would be good for me would be to feel with me, arm around me, guilty as I am, sad,
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   and both of us fall into hell together.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   That's not good news, even if it sounds good to start with that,
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   "Oh, it would be nice to have somebody who could be a sinner with us and thus identify with our sin as a sinner."
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   If Jesus joins me in my sin, he could sympathize as a share of indwelling sin,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   and he would not be God, he would not be a high priest, and he would not be a savior.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   So, he does not identify with indwelling sin, and he does not identify with the deeds of sin.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   He never did one, and he never had any indwelling sin.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   And that's why we need to go to the text and see what it actually says.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   Hebrews 4.15, "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses,
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   but one who in every respect was tempted as we are yet without sin."
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   Now, those last two words, "without sin," are addressed directly to Justin's question.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.800]   "Without sin" means, "No, he does not and cannot join us in our indwelling sin."
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   So, anything he said in that verse can't be taken to mean that he does,
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   which means that we should not absolutize the word "every" and the word "as"
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   when it says, "who in every respect has been tempted as we are."
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.800]   Behind that phrase, "every respect," which is, I think, what he's stumbling over.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   I mean, is it "every"?
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.800]   Is the Greek phrase "kata panta," "according to all things" or "according to everything,"
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.800]   that occurs one other time in Hebrews, interestingly.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.800]   Chapter 2, verse 17, where it says this, "He had to be made like his brothers,"
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   "kata panta," "in every respect,"
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   "so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   to make propitiation for the sins of the people."
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   In other words, that "every," "in every respect," cannot mean sinfulness
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   because Hebrews 7, 27 says, "He had no need like those high priests to offer sacrifices daily,"
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   "first for his own sins," because he didn't have any.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.800]   And so even chapter 2, verse 17 tells us, "Don't go there."
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.800]   You know, don't take "every" to mean that, because it can't mean that in these two verses.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   So, "in every respect" means Jesus identifies with us to the greatest degree possible,
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   and in every way possible, that is good for us.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   In fact, I think I could show—I'll go ahead and do it, try it—
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   I could show this is what Hebrews 4, 15 actually means if we knew the Greek.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   And there are half a dozen people listening to this who do know Greek,
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   so get out your text and see if I'm right on this.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   "He was tempted," "kata panta," "according to all things,"
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.800]   and then here's another "kata," "kata" or "kath"—
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   the pronunciation doesn't matter here—
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.800]   "kath homoio teta choris homartius."
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:44.800]   So, literally, it's "tempted according to all the ways that accord with the likeness."
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.800]   All the ways that accord with the likeness.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.800]   All the ways that accord with the likeness.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   And that likeness there is likeness to us only without sin,
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.800]   just like Romans 8, 3, where the Son came in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.800]   Same word. He's flesh, but he's flesh minus sin.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   Same thing here.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.800]   So it's "He was tempted in all the ways that accord with the likeness,"
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   and the likeness excludes sin, so the "all the ways" excludes sin.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   Very complicated, but I think valid.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   So here's my final response to the question.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   Should we say to Jesus, when we experience the inner warfare of the flesh versus the spirit,
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   that he didn't, should we say to Jesus, "You don't know what I'm going through"?
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.800]   That's Justin's question. "You don't know what I'm going through."
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.800]   No, we should not say that to Jesus, because Jesus could say this,
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   "Given what I know of being in the flesh,
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:58.800]   and given what I know of being the Spirit and having the Spirit and being one with the Spirit,
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   and given what I know of bearing all the sins of the world,
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   even your battle in my body on the tree,
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   and given what I know of seeing into the heart of every saint
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.800]   whose every battle in every day this world has existed,
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   and given what I know of temptation and spiritual warfare on Maundy Thursday and Friday morning,
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   I do know what you're going through.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   I know it in the very best way a Savior can know it.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   And so because I know your battle the way I know it, I can save you from it.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   And if I knew it any other way, there'd be no Savior."
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   Wow. Thank you for laying all this out for us from the text, Pastor John.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   And thank you, Justin, for the exceptional question. We need your exceptional questions.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   And if you have one, please email it to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   Well, we return next week, and we will be welcoming to the podcast a special guest,
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   a young man who has incredibly well-developed pastoral insight.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   I love learning from him. He's only 27 years old.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   His name is William Lee Barefield III, but he's much better known by his stage name, Trip Lee.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   Trip Lee will join us to talk about his own story of suffering, and we'll talk about fame.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.800]   We'll talk about technology. We'll talk about pursuing joy in Christ
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   and even enduring persecution from the world and a host of issues.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   I hope you will join us all next week, all beginning on Monday on the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   with guest Trip Lee.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.800]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Enjoy the weekend.
