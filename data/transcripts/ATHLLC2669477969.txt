[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.060]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.940]   investments.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.300]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.980]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.140]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.000]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of all the hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.760]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.400]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited you're here today.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.600]   And since you're listening to all the hacks, I'm pretty sure you're interested
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.240]   in optimizing your life in a lot of different ways, and you probably also
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.320]   love technology, but paradoxically, those two do not always mix well.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.720]   And that's the message of my guest, Cal Newport.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.180]   He probably doesn't need an introduction because he's the award-winning author
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.520]   of seven books that have been translated to over 40 languages, including deep
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.560]   work, digital minimalism, and most recently, a world without email.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.960]   His writing explores the intersection of culture and technology, and he's been
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.800]   featured in so many publications, including the New York Times, New Yorker,
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.680]   Washington Post, and Economist.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.160]   He's also an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.600]   He hosts the top rated podcast, Deep Questions, and he's a dad with a young
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.100]   family.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.920]   We're going to talk about what a deep life means and some of the ways you can
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.120]   create the best life possible for you.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.240]   Why the hyperactive hive mind of constant email and messages is making you less
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.120]   productive, what you can do about it, how to implement what Cal calls high quality
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.920]   leisure time into your life, and so much more.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.200]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.760]   Cal, welcome to the show.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.120]   Oh, Chris, I'm excited to be here.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.840]   I want to just jump right into the big picture to start.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.720]   Talk about a deep life and what that means and maybe an example of what your
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.760]   deep life looks like.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.720]   Well, the term came along before I had a good definition for it.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   It was at first one of those when you see it type of concepts and it emerged.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.440]   This might not be surprising, but in the first month of the pandemic.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160]   So I started doing a lot of writing.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.240]   I have a newsletter and blog that I would typically update once a week and I was
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.160]   doing it every single day.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.360]   I just felt like I wanted to grapple with the various disruptions in a more public
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.920]   way with my longstanding audience.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.520]   It was in that initial month or so of writing that this term, the deep life
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.480]   emerged as an umbrella term, very roughly speaking about the type of things I
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.120]   talked about.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.760]   And then in May of 2020, I started a podcast because I couldn't see anybody.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.960]   I wasn't on the road.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.840]   I wasn't seeing people.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.600]   And half of the show was dedicated to the deep like it had just emerged forcefully
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.200]   into what I was thinking and writing about.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.760]   And it was at first when you see it, a deep life is a life that you look at and
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.480]   it just resonates something about that.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.280]   It's exciting.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.080]   It's interesting.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.280]   And it just sort of resonated.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.200]   But over time, I've worked through the definition.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.960]   I've tried to become a lot more clear about it.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.800]   And now the way I typically define it is a deep life is one in which you make
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.960]   radical changes to align with your value.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.560]   So, it's when you see someone that have done somewhat radical things and where
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.520]   they live, how they live, their work, the nature of their life, they've made
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.600]   radical changes to align their daily existence with things they truly care about.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.840]   When you see that come together, you're looking at the deep life.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.240]   And when you see the deep life, something inside you typically sings a little bit.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.880]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.520]   Are there some examples of those kind of radical changes you've seen people make,
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.200]   or maybe you've made yourself to get closer to a deep life?
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.280]   There's a couple of general categories you often see when you're looking at deep
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.600]   lives.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:59.120]   So, one, I think certainly involves work, where people radically upend or focus their
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.760]   working life to be closer to their values.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.000]   So, it's where you see the person who becomes whatever, the full-time writer or starts that
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.920]   really interesting business or moves away from the job that maybe was stable, but soul
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.160]   deadening and goes towards something that has a lot of autonomy.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.680]   Just to make it concrete, there's someone I know named Paul Jarvis, who wrote this great
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.360]   book, Company of One, which is about the value of not trying to grow your business to be
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.320]   as big as possible, but to make it the best possible small business.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.520]   And I remember the move he made, he talks about early in that book was leaving, he called
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.320]   it his glass cube in downtown Vancouver, the condo and the big crowded building.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.080]   And they moved to the middle of nowhere, the tip of Vancouver Island, not far from where
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.840]   they filmed the History Channel show alone, several seasons of the show alone.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.680]   So, this really was in the middle of nowhere, but they can surf in the morning and walk
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.160]   through the woods in the afternoon.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.400]   And he was doing this very thoughtfully.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.680]   He wanted to slow down his life, quiet his life, focus on just the work that's important.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.440]   You see it in craft a lot.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.960]   You see it when you look at someone who's deeply involved in craft and maybe it's not
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.840]   the most lucrative thing, but it feels really meaningful.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.000]   You see it when people make location shifts that just the location itself really speaks
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.480]   to them.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:28.320]   One of the types of case studies I like to gather is writers who have really cool second
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.120]   homes where they spend half the year to go and write.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.760]   Usually these writers will spend the other half the year in cities.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.680]   And I've become a collector of those stories.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.040]   Sebastian Younger has this farmhouse in the scrub pines of Turo, Cape Cod.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.080]   So, it's the sort of non-populated area of Cape Cod.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.520]   It's a little artist colony.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.400]   It's not on the water.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.120]   It's in the woods.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.320]   You have to go down a really long dirt road to get to the house.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.680]   They spend half the year there.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.920]   Simon Winchester leaves New York in the summers to go to a farm in Sandless Fields, Massachusetts
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.720]   in the foothills of the Berkshires where he converted a barn.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.360]   That's where he goes and that's when he writes.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.000]   And they tend bees in the afternoons when he's not doing that.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.120]   These are the type of examples that sing out to me of people who made radical changes in
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.040]   their lives to align it with what they really care about.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.080]   There's a lot to touch on there with work and career and where you live.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.440]   But I want to ask something I haven't seen you write too much about or talk about is
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.320]   what about people?
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.880]   Is there like a deep version of a relationship that is much more important in this kind of life?
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.440]   Well, I think community is a big part of the deep life.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.760]   Typically, when I talk about this concept, I break it into different areas.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.000]   There's a long running joke on my podcast where everything has to be alliterative with
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.200]   C's when we talk about the deep life.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.280]   But there's typically the five areas I talk about.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.680]   There's craft, which is like work, producing things.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.960]   There's community is number two.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.320]   So, that's what we'll talk about here in a second.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.720]   And then you can have - I use constitution just to be alliterative, but to talk about
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.920]   health and fitness.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.760]   You can talk about contemplation to talk about philosophy, theology, etc.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.360]   Sometimes we throw in celebration to talk about gratitude, enjoyment of life, just developing
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.720]   interests that have no functional reason other than just appreciation and enjoyment.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.840]   So, community is, of these five things, incredibly important.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.960]   And I think that's another thing.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.840]   It's actually something my family did in our own life.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.800]   When we were looking to move, we were going to have our third child.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.920]   Our house was too small.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.400]   One of the things we really focused on and thinking where to move was community.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:30.880]   So, we found on the outskirts of DC, right across the border, there was a town that had
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.480]   been around since the 1800s.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.040]   And the city has grown out past it since, but the town is still there and retains all
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.000]   the character of a town, has its own mayor, its own police force.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.480]   And it's a place where everyone knows each other.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.880]   It's a place where your kids come and live after they go off, they come back and live
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.240]   there and they take over your houses.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:54.720]   We moved here purposefully because we wanted to be deeply enmeshed in community.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.240]   So, I think that's another thing you certainly see when you look at people living deep lives
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.800]   is the role of these interpersonal connections, actually being deeply connected to other people,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.560]   sacrificing non-trivial time and energy on behalf of other people, try and take up a
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.720]   role of leadership among real flesh and blood people around you.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.480]   I think all that's critical to deep living.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.920]   - What about within your family?
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.200]   What about those relationships?
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.120]   Is there anything changed as you've thought through this?
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.040]   - Something that came out, and this was before I really coined the term deep life.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.920]   But when I was doing research for a book I wrote about our relationship with digital
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:33.520]   devices, one thing that emerged from that is that the human social brain, which is a
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.640]   very large portion of our brain, we're very social animals.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.800]   We dedicate a lot of neuronal firepower to interacting with other people, maintaining
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.520]   relationships.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.520]   It doesn't understand digital connection.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:53.920]   It does not understand text on a little piece of glowing glass with bitmap smiling face
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.400]   emojis.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.360]   It does not understand that in the same way it understands you are right here.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   I can see you, I can hear you, I can look at your body language, I can look at your
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.320]   inflection.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.880]   I know that this was a sacrifice.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.160]   I had to take time out of my day to come to your house and spend time with you.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.720]   Out of that sacrifice, I actually increased the importance I'm going to assign to this
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.840]   as an interaction.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.760]   This is what our social brains expect when it comes to relationships.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:26.160]   If you move more of your social life into a digital context, especially a text-based
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.040]   digital context, it can actually make you profoundly lonely because so much of our social
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.280]   brain doesn't know what that is.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.480]   But it does not think about that in the same way it thinks about I'm spending the afternoon
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.560]   with you, with a real person in person.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.080]   So, certainly, that seems to be an important element about our current moment, especially
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:50.640]   post-pandemic is getting back to real-life analog interactions that require non-trivial
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.480]   sacrifice of time and energy on your behalf.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.280]   If you're doing that, your brain's going to be a lot more happy than if you're instead
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.960]   juggling seven or eight WhatsApp threads.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:05.680]   - Is there science for broader principles of deep work and other parts of deep life
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.880]   that really support, not just anecdotally, but with evidence and data, the benefits of
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.760]   making these changes?
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.400]   - I mean, I think in each of those different buckets we talked about, you can pull upon
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.000]   your own stream of science.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.960]   So, if you want to look at this community bucket and the importance of in-person socialization,
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.360]   there is no shortage of studies.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:30.240]   I talk about a lot of this in my book, Digital Minimalism, that really gets into the human
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.080]   processing of social connection and how much information really goes back and forth.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:40.160]   There's a really nice study that I summarize in that book where they brought in business
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.440]   students, I believe.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.680]   They brought them in to hear pitches for business ideas.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.240]   So, half the group gathered in a conference room and actually did this.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.600]   And then the other half of the group, they gave them written transcripts of the pitch
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.320]   for the business.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.800]   And it was night and day, the difference between the receptions, because the people who were
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.720]   in the room were actually having a real social connection.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.640]   They're getting all this information from the person.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.040]   It was a much more sophisticated understanding of what was going on.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.520]   There's another really cool study that was looking at email.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:15.200]   What it really focused on is the degree to which when you're writing an email, you completely
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.800]   overestimate how well you're going to be understood by the recipient, because you know the whole
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.280]   context.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.720]   You know the whole social context.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.080]   You know the whole emotional context.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.720]   You know when you're writing it, you're chuckling like this is funny.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.840]   I know what's going on.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.920]   And it all gets reduced down to characters and it gets to the recipient and all of that
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.640]   context vanishes and they have no idea what's going on.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.440]   Is he joking?
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.240]   Is this serious?
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:36.960]   Is he's mad?
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.840]   What does he mean?
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.640]   It's a great reflection of how much information is actually captured in the non-linguistic
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.040]   aspects of communication, the aspects that go beyond just the actual written transcript
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.160]   of what you're trying to say.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.400]   There are similar lines of research you can look at for work and deep work and what happens
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.680]   with context switching.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.240]   There's certainly research, obviously, about health and fitness and the advantages you
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.080]   get from actually taking care of that.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.440]   There's an even broader research on efficacy.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:09.360]   Just the idea that in any of these areas that you are taking control, you're expressing
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.600]   autonomy on how your life unfolds, that's an elixir.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.040]   That is magic.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.840]   What it does to yourself, your sense of self-worth, your ability to act when you feel like you
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:26.240]   have control, you have agency over areas of your life, that agency itself is incredibly
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.440]   beneficial regardless of the details of what exactly you're doing with it.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.160]   So, there's a lot of different science floating around underneath and supporting up the notion
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:34.880]   of the deep life.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.800]   I know you've said that you tell people, "Imagine that life that you want, where you are, what
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.520]   you're doing and work backwards to make that a reality."
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.240]   I think you've called it lifestyle-centric career planning.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.800]   How do you think people put that into place?
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.680]   Is it something that anyone can do at any point in their career?
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.320]   I think it's important that you refresh this exercise.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.400]   I turned 40 two days after recording this.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.760]   And to me, turning 40 is a great milestone to go through this exercise again.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.480]   You go through it when you're leaving school and then a lot of people go through it again
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.520]   in your late 20s.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.480]   Once you actually have some momentum going and some sense of what's happening, what your
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.160]   opportunities are, then you want to redirect.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.480]   And then I think 40 is another time to do it.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.520]   Now, here's the key about lifestyle-centric career - well, I call it lifestyle-centric
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.920]   career planning, but it could really just be lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.960]   It's not just about your job.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:33.920]   The key to this is trying to work backwards from almost a sense memory of the lifestyle.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.360]   What type of place do you live?
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.560]   What is your day like?
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:42.720]   Are you in the countryside and it's sun dappled and in the evening, some friends are gathering
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.200]   outside in a picnic table under cafe lights?
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.240]   Or is it a city and it's hard charging and you're making moves?
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:54.400]   You really want to get a sense memory of this ideal lifestyle that you can see and you can
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.680]   smell and you taste.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:02.560]   The hard part is you don't want specifics about, for example, what you do for work.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.880]   So, I think where people get tripped up is they say, "Okay, well, I want to imagine what
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.440]   job would make me really happy."
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.960]   And the magic of lifestyle-centric career planning is you go for what lifestyle makes
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.960]   you happy and then you work backwards to say, "What could I do to get there?"
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.840]   And it unlocks.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.640]   That's when you're thinking through that exercise, "How do I get to that lifestyle?"
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.320]   So, you start thinking through what type of job might make that possible.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:30.720]   So, you actually want the vision of the lifestyle to inform your professional choices for it.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.440]   And I think it's a lot different than how a lot of people do it, which is instead to
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.440]   try to navel gaze and figure out through reflection, "This is the job I want.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.800]   And then how do I make that happen?"
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.120]   I actually think that can be short-sighted and you get too focused on the job you want.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.440]   A, people are terrible at predicting what the actual on-the-ground reality will be of
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.400]   a given job.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.960]   And B, when you're focused too much on just the details of the job, you're allowing all
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.120]   the other aspects of your lifestyle to be ungrounded and fall into place somewhat arbitrarily.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.840]   And they're almost certainly going to fall into a configuration that doesn't resonate.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.880]   You might end up unhappy.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.960]   So, it's this weird conflicting demand of clarity of what your life is like without
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.880]   any clarity or specifics at all about exactly what allows that life.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.720]   That's what you work backwards to figure out.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.800]   I don't know if you're familiar with this concept.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.880]   I think it's Japanese of "Ikigai", where it's like what you're good at, what you love,
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.640]   what the world needs, what you can get paid for.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.800]   When I hear what you're saying, I wonder, "How much does it matter what you love doing
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.520]   professionally as much as how much does what you do professionally allow you to live the
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.400]   life you love?"
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.480]   People often say, "Find the thing you're passionate about.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.200]   Make it your job."
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.440]   Do you think that's just overused advice for people and that they could probably be
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.280]   happy with many jobs?
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.200]   If they live a life they love?
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:43.520]   Yes.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.880]   I think the latter is true.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.760]   I wrote a whole book about that called "So Good They Can't Ignore You" where the entire
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.360]   premise was to push back on the idea that follow your passion is the most effective
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.720]   advice if your goal is to end up passionate about your life and what you do.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.920]   And the premise of that book is if you study more closely, people who really do love their
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:10.080]   jobs and love their lives, nine times out of ten, they did not start with a clear vision
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.800]   of their professional life that they then pursued and then once achieved, felt that
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.280]   passion.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.680]   Actually, the passion was emergent as their professional life unfolded and their professional
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.640]   life often unfolded in directions that they did not predict in advance.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.680]   And so, I think this notion that we have an ingrained, innate passion.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.160]   So, we're wired for a certain type of job.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:37.040]   And to unlock that feeling of passion, you have to find that job.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.560]   I think that construction, which in the American context, I did the research on this, is relatively
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:42.960]   recent.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.040]   You don't find the phrase "follow your passion" in any professional context really
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.120]   till the late 1980s, early 1990s.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.720]   It's a relatively new concept.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.560]   I think it's actually a dangerous construction.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:57.040]   What you want to do is not follow your passion, but follow the goal of being passionate about
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:57.440]   your life.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:02.560]   And I think that's a much more complicated endeavor than just having this lightning bolt
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.920]   clarity when you're 19 that whatever, I'm meant to be a social media brand manager for
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.200]   an athletic wear company.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.360]   And if I can just go get that job, I'm going to be happy.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.000]   It's kind of naive.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.760]   It's like a Disney tale version of life satisfaction.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.160]   The reality is more interesting, but it's also more complicated.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.080]   Well, I can tell you when I was coming out of college, I thought, "Oh, I don't know
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.360]   what I want to do, but it sounds like the best job is to be an investment banker."
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.840]   And I now, I don't know, as a creator making podcasts, couldn't be farther from that.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.200]   And funny enough, I think mine also started May 2020 during COVID.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.360]   So, I don't think you can predict that path.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:40.640]   So, I'm definitely a fan of working on things you enjoy, but not trying to presume that
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.320]   you can figure out what it is in advance.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.360]   It explains why I ended up a professor.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.000]   But I got there doing lifestyle-centric career planning when I was trying to figure out coming
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.040]   out of college, what do I want to do?
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.160]   It was a lifestyle image.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:00.800]   And there's this lifestyle image where autonomy, more control over my time, sort of intellectualism.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.960]   I had a pretty clear image of the house.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.040]   It's not so big, but there's interesting people coming over to the backyard.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.320]   And that really resonated.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.480]   I had a job offer from Microsoft and I had grad school acceptances.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.640]   And that was the thinking that led me towards grad school.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.880]   Not, "I'm super passionate.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.960]   I have to be doing theoretical computer science theory."
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.680]   I liked it, but I also liked the stuff I'd be doing at Microsoft.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:29.440]   It was, "That job out in Redmond is going to be much less autonomous.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.360]   My schedule is going to be much less mine.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.960]   It's going to be much more driven."
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.360]   That lifestyle, forget the specifics of the work, that lifestyle doesn't resonate.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.400]   And so, then I went over towards grad school and said, "We'll figure out what happens next,
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:40.960]   next."
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.120]   And so, anyway, just to use that as a concrete example of letting the lifestyle pull you
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:45.360]   forward.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.080]   Ultimately, the life you live, what your day-to-day life is like, is what is going to generate
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.480]   your satisfaction or dissatisfaction with life.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.880]   Most jobs, no matter what the content is, 80% of it is not going to be the specific
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.000]   activity being exciting.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.160]   You have to answer this email and pay this invoice.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:05.200]   So, what really determines your day-to-day satisfaction is the actual full experience,
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.600]   subjective structure of your day.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.000]   No content of your work can make a day-to-day existence that's largely out of line with
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.280]   what really resonates with you, what really matches with what you want your life to be
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:15.680]   like.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.520]   No specific content of work in the long run can save you from that mismatch.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.400]   It's the famous canard.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.680]   No matter how great your job is, if there's a two-hour commute, you're going to be miserable.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.440]   This is that writ large.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.960]   I want to jump into that work moment.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.400]   But you mentioned what I think was the brief quote that I've heard you share before from
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.200]   Steve Martin.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.680]   And I just want you to reintroduce us to that because when I first heard it through you,
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.040]   it had a big impact on my life.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.840]   And I know it was an early big impact on your life.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:46.000]   So, the actual quote came from an interview that Steve Martin did about his memoir Born
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.840]   Standing Up, which I actually just reread last month.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.880]   And I highly recommend it.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.720]   It's a professional memoir, only focused on how Steve Martin's career took off.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   So, it's just really focused on his career.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.520]   It's a great encapsulation of how someone does something innovative.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.080]   So, he was doing an interview about that book, Born Standing Up.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.120]   It was on Charlie Rose.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.240]   And Charlie asked him about career advice.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.200]   And Martin said, and I'm only slightly paraphrasing here.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.840]   He's like, "I always give the same advice and it's never what people want to hear.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.400]   What they want to hear is here's the secret to getting an agent.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.640]   Here's the secret to getting attention among when other people are trying to do it."
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.480]   He's like, "But what I always tell them is the same thing.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.200]   Be so good they can't ignore you.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.320]   If you do that, all the other good things will come."
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.160]   And that was really important to me, that advice.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.800]   I was probably a third year doctoral student at MIT at the time.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.960]   And it clarified a lot for me.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.520]   I was a writer.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.720]   I'd written two books at the time and was working on a third.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.880]   And it just clarified so much for me.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:53.440]   Because I still had this sort of entrepreneurial hack culture mindset of the way I'm going to
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.840]   break out in academia is you got to figure out the right topics that no one else knows.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.880]   And market it well and hit a topic that's really cool.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.440]   And your books, it's all about getting this marketing plan.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.920]   And Martin's advice is slice through that, right?
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.960]   Like a warm knife through butter.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.440]   No, no, no.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.800]   You got to just do great stuff.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.320]   The other stuff will work it out.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:16.560]   So, that quote was so influential that I mentioned it before in the context of a book I ended up
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.320]   writing where I actually called the book "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:25.360]   And that was just a direct quote from that Steve Martin line, which has been a guiding light to
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.360]   what I've been doing in my career from here on out.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.080]   So, maybe we can combine that with lifestyle-centric career planning.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.720]   Figure out your lifestyle, work backwards.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.280]   "Okay, what can I do for work that's going to get me near that lifestyle?"
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.560]   Then once you've figured out that work, use Martin's advice.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.240]   Aim to be so good you can't be ignored.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.680]   Because that's going to unlock more and more leverage, more and more opportunities,
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.720]   more and more interesting angles you never would have thought about before.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:53.760]   Skill is your best weapon when it comes to trying to fight back on "we" and build
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.800]   a really cool life.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.160]   Continually trying to be good is probably the most useful thing you can do to keep
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.760]   the options for your life to be cool as interesting as possible.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.360]   I was having a conversation with Dan Pink, who you might be familiar with.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:10.080]   And he talks about mastery being one of the biggest motivating factors for people.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.520]   I think of what Steve Martin said, and I think of it a little bit as mastery,
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:19.600]   is find this thing that you can become incredible at and whatever it is can excite you.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.320]   It doesn't have to be the thing you thought you were the most excited about.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.800]   But that process of honing a skill.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.280]   If you asked me two years ago whether the process of honing the skill of preparing and
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.600]   researching and planning and conducting interviews would be something that was high on my list,
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.520]   I never would have put it in the top 20.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.680]   And I get so much satisfaction from doing that.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.240]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.040]   I get it.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.640]   Life comes at you fast.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.720]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.720]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.560]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.240]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.120]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.880]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.320]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out,
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.840]   or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.480]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.360]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.040]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.080]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection of beer,
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.560]   wine and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.480]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week,
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.080]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour,
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.680]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.560]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.640]   That's D-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.600]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.040]   The other thing you said that made me laugh is that
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:59.440]   the show is called All The Hacks and I struggle with the name all the time
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.960]   because a lot of what I do in my own life is,
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.760]   "Oh, you have to really put in the work to make this possible."
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.520]   It's not just there's a trick here and there.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.560]   So in many cases, most of the hacks that we end up talking about are
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.960]   these massive fundamental mindset shifts or changes to your routine.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.480]   They're not little tricks and twists.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.520]   So I keep coming back to, "Gosh, is that the right name?"
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.800]   A lot of people see that.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:26.080]   And even if the message isn't there is a trick to fix everything in five minutes,
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.440]   the story brings people in.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.600]   And if I can convince them that maybe life isn't necessarily about just little tricks and hacks,
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.960]   but bigger fundamental shifts, then maybe the name does its purpose.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.240]   I share your situation because my longstanding...
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:44.000]   Originally just a blog that I started in 2007 and now also primarily an email newsletter
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.440]   is called Study Hacks.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.720]   Because when I first was writing, I was writing student advice books.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.800]   And my longstanding newsletter has the word hacks in it.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.800]   And I have the same feeling about it because hacks can mean two different things.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.600]   The positive aspect that you're talking about, I think,
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.840]   is coming at something fresh with intention.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.720]   So instead of just assuming, "Hey, what can I do here?"
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.600]   I just have to...
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.240]   In my old context, studying, studying,
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.720]   all that matters is how many hours you put at it.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.680]   And the good aspect of that hack mentality is like, "Well, wait a second.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.280]   Let's question assumptions here.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.600]   What does studying mean?
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.560]   What am I really trying to do?
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.240]   I'm trying to prepare for this type of test.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.400]   Well, what type of activities could I do to prepare?"
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:20.880]   You know what?
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.160]   These things that everyone else is doing in the library are pretty ineffective.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:29.280]   But if I instead did active recall on index cards and did it first thing in the morning
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:34.400]   in a novel location, I could cut this time down by a factor of four,
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.680]   which I think is a really positive connotation to hacks,
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.800]   which is questioning assumptions and saying, "Am I really doing this the best way?
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.680]   Have I really thought this through?"
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.520]   So you don't just get stuck.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.560]   The negative interpretation, I think, is...
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.920]   When I was saying entrepreneur hacks, there was a period where there was a culture.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.560]   I used to call it checklist entrepreneurship.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.080]   So maybe this sounds familiar.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.600]   Like the early blogging culture, where there's this sense where
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.680]   you could have a successful blog or something like this, be a successful content marketer.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.640]   If you just had the right checklist, the right information.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.920]   Do this and this and this and this.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.160]   And if you just went down the list and did all the things,
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.600]   you would have all of this success.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.240]   That checklist entrepreneurship that was early on.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.600]   And pretty quickly, people found out, "Oh, that's not enough.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.480]   It's not enough.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.840]   How many words do I publish?
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.280]   And how do I set up my funnel?
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.360]   I actually have to write something that's interesting.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.800]   And that's going to take some craft."
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.680]   That was what was tripping me up early in my academic career was
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.040]   I was trying to hack around the marketing of my work.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.600]   I was trying to hack around if you just got the right topic.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   It's so easy to fall in love with this idea of everyone else is just conventional.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.600]   And just by being more bold, I'll be able to immediately have success.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.680]   And in the end, it turns out, no, you still have to do really hard work in the end.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.560]   So, I'm with you.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.440]   My work is associated with the word hack to this day, proudly so.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.360]   Because when you're questioning, "Why are we doing it this way?"
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.800]   I think there's a lot of value in it.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.680]   And then where it becomes a problem is where people leave out the second piece of,
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.560]   "Okay, anything really important is still going to require a lot of hard work."
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.680]   That's why I love travel so much is that
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.920]   part of what gives me the ability to question so many assumptions is that
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.120]   I've been fortunate to spend a lot of my free time traveling.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.560]   And you just see all these people doing different things in different ways all over the world.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.920]   I think there's probably 20 or 30 different ways to count money.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.360]   And there's like cool videos on YouTube where you watch them and you watch people count money.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.560]   And I was like, "Oh, interesting."
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:27.600]   And the other day, someone showed me how in Korea, they count numbers on your hand.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.920]   And they start with an open hand and they count in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.960]   and then they go out 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and you end up with a whole hand.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.480]   And then you could just keep repeating it.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.200]   And I was like, "Oh my gosh. I've been counting with my hand in a less efficient way my whole
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.720]   life." And I just love that ability to see how other people do things can open you up to
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.360]   how you might be able to do things better.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.880]   I'm going to use that to jump into talking a little bit about deep work,
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.840]   because that was my first exposure to your writing.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.880]   I learned that if I can concentrate and focus on things, that's a skill that people can learn.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.480]   But for people who haven't read the book,
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.280]   first off, you probably should because we're not going to do it justice.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.200]   But could you talk a little bit about
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.720]   what you learned that led to that book and how people can work on that skill?
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:16.000]   I think what people underestimate is the cost of context shifting.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.880]   This is the scientific underpinning of deep work, which is this argument that
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.240]   concentrating on one challenging thing for a long period of time is a very important activity.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.720]   And you should practice it and you should spend a lot of time doing it.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.400]   It's a huge competitive advantage.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.360]   If you do anything that requires your mind to make a living.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.640]   And the reason why it's so effective is when you are focusing on one thing
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:43.280]   without distraction, so you're not flipping back and forth.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.800]   You're not glancing at your phone.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.640]   You're not jumping off and on on Slack.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.240]   You're avoiding cognitive context shifts,
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:55.600]   which are a productivity poison that most people don't realize that they are ingesting.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.480]   Because every time you take your attention off of your primary target
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.840]   and switch it over to something else, even if it's brief,
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.600]   even if it's just like got a glance at my inbox,
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.280]   because I'm waiting to hear back from someone.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.000]   We're trying to set up a meeting, even if it's 30 seconds.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.200]   When you bring your attention back to that primary hard activity, that little switch
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.120]   has a massive cognitive impact.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.600]   It degrades your cognitive capacity for a non-trivial amount of time going forward.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.040]   Because if you look actually under the covers in the neurons of your brain,
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:27.600]   what happens?
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.480]   It sees the inbox.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.200]   It sees all of these highly salient pieces of information,
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.720]   different than what you're working on.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.640]   Many of them coming from individuals, from bosses, from clients.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.160]   So, there's this whole social situation to it.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.960]   You don't want to keep your tribe members
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.280]   waiting in a Paleolithic evolutionary tour descent.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.960]   So, it gets a lot of attention.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.920]   You're beginning a very messy process in your brain where certain networks are being amplified,
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.840]   other semantic neural networks are being inhibited.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.040]   So, you begin this big process that takes five or 10 minutes to complete,
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.720]   but then you abort it almost immediately to try to go back to the original thing.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.760]   Now, you have a collision.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.720]   Unrelated networks were beginning to be amplified.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.960]   Related networks were beginning to be inhibited.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.880]   Now, these things are clashing with each other.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:17.440]   The way that actually feels subjectively is fuzzy thinking, resistance, a powerful urge to just,
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.280]   you know what, screw it.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.800]   Like, I got to stop working on this hard thing.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.400]   Let's just do email, right?
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.680]   And so, what most knowledge workers are doing without realizing it is that they are
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.840]   persistently putting themselves into the state of reduced cognitive capacity,
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.560]   because every five to six minutes, on average, they have to check an inbox,
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.640]   check Slack, see what's going on email, see what's going on my phone.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.440]   And they think they're single tasking because they don't literally have two
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.960]   things open at the same time.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.720]   They're not trying to talk on the phone while they write.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.160]   They think they're single tasking.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.480]   But these quick checks every five or six minutes are a neuronal disaster.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.480]   And you're working at a fraction of your cognitive capacity.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.480]   The work you're producing is worse.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.440]   The time it takes to produce it is longer.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.240]   And you get to a mental exhaustion where you just give up and go on social media and email
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.400]   much quicker because your brain can't take it.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.800]   It cries "uncle" by whatever, lunchtime, one o'clock, two o'clock.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.560]   And so, we don't realize, as people who use our brains to make a living,
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.640]   that we are giving ourselves this huge handicap.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.040]   We are literally making ourselves much dumber.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.160]   And it's an unforced error.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.200]   So, deep work is basically saying, don't do that.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.960]   If you're going to work on something hard, just do that for an hour.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.440]   Do it for 90 minutes with no context shifts.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.640]   It feels like a superpower, not because it makes you much smarter,
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.920]   but it makes you avoid the things that's making everyone else much dumber.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.680]   So, by comparison, the one-eyed man is a king in the kingdom of the blind or
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.800]   however that saying goes.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.920]   That's really what happens.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.480]   If you are not context shifting, you feel like you're the Bradley Cooper character
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:52.400]   in Limitless and everyone else is slamming back some shots during the workday.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.960]   I get why it's important, but I wonder if you've had any
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:59.440]   experiences or learnings to help people fight that discomfort.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.480]   One way I've tried is just turn on Do Not Disturb.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.840]   I love the features that Apple rolled out where you can basically hide all
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.520]   of these notifications so you don't see them.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.320]   But you still have this urge where you're like, "I wonder what happened."
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.680]   Is there any tips to try to fight that and get comfortable with it?
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.080]   Well, you got to do two things.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.760]   You have to time block and you have to train.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.920]   The time blocking is I'm not just going to wing it.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.520]   As I go through my workday, I'm not just going to say, "What do I want to work on next?
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.880]   What am I in the mood to work on?"
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.320]   You're always going to lose that battle.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.680]   You'll be like, "Well, I got to check this."
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.560]   And there's all these urgent things.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.880]   So, time blocking is you give every minute of your day a plan.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.680]   So, during this time, I'm working on this thing.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.440]   And then during this time, I'm doing email.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.040]   I'm not in the email time right now.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.560]   I don't do email during this block.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.520]   This block is specifically put aside for writing this article.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.720]   So, that's what I'm doing.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.200]   And if I stop, I'm failing on my plan.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.720]   You make the stakes clear.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.320]   Then you actually have to train your ability to concentrate so you can actually
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.680]   get through those blocks without it being a horrific experience.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:02.480]   And this is something people miss, the trainability of concentration.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.240]   And the reason why that's important is if you don't realize that, here's what happens.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.240]   You just hear the first part of what I say.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.320]   "Okay, I'm going to put aside two hours.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.200]   I'm going to focus.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.240]   No email, no social media, no Slack."
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.840]   If you have not trained your ability to concentrate, you're going to make it
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:24.320]   20 minutes into that two hours and it's going to be just that friction and the boredom,
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.000]   your concentration, you'll just break down because your brain doesn't know how to do it.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:28.240]   Right?
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.920]   It's the physical equivalent of saying, "I want to be a runner.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.240]   All right, I'm going to go run 15 miles."
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:38.240]   And after you get half a mile, you're down on your knees huffing and puffing, right?
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.520]   Because you haven't trained.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.280]   The difference is for the aspiring runner, they're like, "Okay, of course, I didn't make
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:43.680]   it very far.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.800]   I haven't been training."
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.280]   Right?
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.880]   But when it comes to focus, because people don't realize it's trainable, they have the
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.800]   wrong conclusion, which is, "Well, maybe I'm just not good at concentrating."
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.520]   And they stop trying.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:59.440]   So, knowing it's trainable is critical so that you don't give up when it's hard at first.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.880]   And training is actually not that hard.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.200]   I'll mention two really quick things you can do.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.360]   One is boredom exposure therapy.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.600]   So, this is where you, on a regular basis, let's say once or twice a day, give yourself
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.880]   small controlled doses of boredom.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.720]   And all that really means is don't use your phone.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.120]   So, if you go to the pharmacy, "Okay, I have to wait in line to get my prescription.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.280]   I'm not going to check my phone while I'm in line."
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.400]   Or, "I'm getting gas.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.440]   You know what?
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:30.160]   I'm just going to fill up my car with gas and not look at my phone and just stare at
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:34.560]   that incredibly expensive price that's piling up and get worried about it," or whatever.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.640]   You do this a couple times a day on a regular basis.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.800]   Once a week, do a more extended period of boredom.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.880]   So, go for a fair-sized walk without your phone.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:46.800]   The reason why you do this is so that your brain gets used to the ideas that sometimes
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.040]   when you're bored, you don't get novel stimuli.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.720]   Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.080]   That's critical.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:56.240]   So, when it comes time to actually do deep work, which by definition is boring because
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.520]   there's not a lot of novel stimuli.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.560]   You're doing just one thing.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.720]   Your brain will tolerate it.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:04.960]   If at every instance, when you get the slightest hint of boredom, you always pull out that
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.720]   phone, your brain's just going to form a Pavlovian connection that says, "We always get shiny
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.760]   treats when we're bored.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.280]   There's no way we're going to tolerate sitting here for 90 minutes just looking at one thing."
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.360]   So, boredom exposure therapy is important.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.280]   The second thing you can do is interval training.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.040]   Literally get a timer.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   For 20 minutes, I'm going to concentrate hard on doing this one thing.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.080]   If I break my concentration and look at something else, I have to stop and restart the timer.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:32.080]   You will follow through because you don't want to embarrass yourself.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.040]   It's only 20 minutes.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.080]   You see a finish line.
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.600]   Okay, seven more minutes and we're done.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.720]   I can keep focusing.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.920]   And you just do that until it's comfortable and you add 10 minutes.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:43.200]   And then you do that new duration until it's comfortable and you add 10 minutes.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.960]   Do this in three or four months of this, you'll be able to lock in for 90 minutes to two hours
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.240]   without an unbearable friction.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.520]   So, those are two examples of things you can do to actually get better at holding your
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.280]   attention on one particular target.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.320]   Is that 90 to 120 minutes?
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.760]   Is that a good cap for you can't do this for eight hours straight?
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.160]   I think two hours is a good goal.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:09.120]   So, where the 90 minutes came from is I first started using that technique when I was advising
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:09.520]   students.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:14.560]   So, my first few books were aimed at students and I was helping them with their focus.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:19.760]   And students have terrible focus, especially once the era of smartphones and ubiquitous
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.800]   wireless internet came along.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.400]   I mean, they had terrible focus.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.560]   And the way they studied was just awful.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.400]   Back then, it was GChat and texting.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.560]   They would be doing this simultaneously while they're studying.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.880]   My goal with them was always to get them the 90 minutes.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.720]   I could do it in a semester, like a three months period.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.240]   I could get them up to about 90 minutes.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.600]   I think two hours is really good.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.800]   If you can go two hours and you take a break and then maybe do another two hours later
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.760]   in the day, you're going to be in the top 25 percentile of concentrators and you can
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.120]   do a lot of damage with that.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:52.000]   It reminds me, I took this scrum class where I was being trained to be a scrum product
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:52.400]   owner.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:57.600]   And the instructor was sharing that they were doing this test where they shorten the work
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.520]   week first by half a day, by another half a day, and by half a day increments.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.880]   And they found that people could eventually become equally as productive at two and a
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.800]   half days as they were at five.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.480]   And then after two and a half, it fell apart.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.560]   You couldn't get to two or one and a half.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.640]   And I read something you wrote about slow productivity, which really aligned with that,
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.800]   which is "Wow, if you can be very productive in smaller periods of time, then you have
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.080]   other time throughout the week to live a more fulfilling life.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.280]   And the net result is better both for work and not."
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.720]   I think that's somewhat in line with what you talk about with slow productivity.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.560]   But I'm curious, how does that practically work in the world?
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.760]   And is it even possible?
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:41.520]   Or is it more an idea that seems amazing, but would be hard to actually execute in our
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.560]   modern workplace?
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.520]   It's not impossible.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:48.960]   Part of it is just pulling apart work that you're mixing together.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.560]   So everything still gets done, but you're pulling it apart.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.240]   So part of it is that easy.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.960]   Just saying "When I'm working on this, I'm just working on this.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.240]   And when I'm doing communication, email and Slack, I'm just doing communication.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.280]   I'm just doing email and Slack."
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:05.680]   So just pulling apart the stuff you had muddied together, all the same things happen.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:10.720]   All the same people get email replies, all the work gets done, but the work gets done
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.360]   faster and at a higher level of quality because you avoid the context shift.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.680]   So part of this is just pulling apart stuff that we are mushing together.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.040]   There's a bigger challenge, I think, in the world of work, however.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.160]   I do apologize that my answer to every question is I wrote a book on this.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.480]   This is what happens after you've been writing books for a long time.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.600]   But the most recent book I wrote was called "A World Without Email".
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.920]   And it asked this question of how do we get to this place where especially office work
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.160]   or knowledge work is so frenetic with so much email and Slack and Zoom.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.200]   And we're always running around coordinating and talking about work.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.320]   And it's so hard to actually have time left over to work.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:44.880]   How do we get there?
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.160]   And what should we do about it?
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.240]   And the premise of that book was we got there accidentally.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:55.120]   In knowledge work, we made this critical decision that productivity should be
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:55.600]   personal.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   So it's just up to you to figure out how you're going to organize all your work.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.640]   You got to read David Allen.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.920]   You got to go to 43 folders.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.720]   That's all on you.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:08.000]   And in a world where everyone is responsible for their own productivity, we fell into this
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   least common denominator, optimally flexible, optimally easy way of collaborating,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.880]   which I call the hyperactive high fine, which is just back and forth unstructured messaging.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.960]   Grab people as you need them, have this ongoing asynchronous back and forth conversation
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.480]   happening with everyone at all times.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.680]   At first, it was just email.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.080]   And now we have Slack and Teams, and it's all the same thing.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:28.960]   Just say, what about this?
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.360]   You have this.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.320]   What's going on over here?
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:35.680]   And that hyperactive hive mind mode of collaboration, that's probably the biggest enemy
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:41.040]   to undistracted focus because it demands a lot of attention.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:46.160]   If there's 15 different things you're involved in, streams of conversation where things are
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.760]   trying to be figured out and it's asynchronous, you never know when the next chat is going to
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.680]   come in or the next response is going to come in.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:56.240]   It's really hard to disentangle from checking those channels because if you go away for
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:00.480]   three hours, now there's 15 conversations that have to wait for three hours, and that
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:05.520]   might not be acceptable because there maybe has to be five back and forth messages required
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.440]   to figure out what time we're meeting tomorrow.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.960]   And so, we can't wait three hours between each message, or we'll never get to a decision.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:16.160]   So, probably the largest systemic enemy to this deeper, more sequential, slower way of
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.920]   working is this hyperactive hive mind mode of collaboration that demands constant attention
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.800]   to communication channels.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:25.360]   So, my argument is fixing that is going to have a huge impact.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.680]   But even before we fix that, just time blocking and pulling apart.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.960]   When I do this, I'm doing this.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.400]   When I communicate, I communicate.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.240]   And I have to apologize, I'll apologize.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.640]   But I'm not mixing those two things together.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.680]   Just making that declaration is going to make you a lot more effective.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:44.160]   I just thought of some combo of trying to solve that in a work environment that I might
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.680]   experiment with, which is putting something public on your calendar that's like
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.720]   letting people know that this is the time that we can collaborate to schedule things
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:53.760]   or communicate.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:58.480]   So, not just time blocking for yourself, but time blocking for others.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.440]   Because like you said, sometimes you need five or six back and forth.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.760]   But if you can tell someone, "Hey, from 3 to 4pm, I'm available for five to six back
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.160]   and forth."
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.400]   Maybe people can work around each other's schedules a little better and get into deep
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.120]   work more.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:16.000]   Not to overstep, but that is one of the easiest things that people can do that has the biggest
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.240]   difference is office hours.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.960]   And there are companies that do this and that they write about it.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:28.080]   But here are the times in which every day, my office door is open, my phone is on, my
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.720]   Slack is open, my inbox is open.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:37.040]   If you have anything, any sort of interaction with me that requires more than a one message
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:37.440]   answer.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.480]   So, anything with any interaction beyond just, "Can you remind me again when the meeting
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.200]   is next week?"
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.080]   So, if I can respond to it with one message, that's fine.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.200]   I can wait till I next check my email.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.920]   If it requires more than that, wait till my office hours.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:54.320]   You wait till my office hours, and then I will go back and forth, we'll all go back
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:54.880]   and forth.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:00.080]   And in that one hour period, we can get 15 different asynchronous conversations solved.
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.760]   It is a game changer.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.800]   And it sounds like a simple thing and you worry like, "Oh, people will be annoyed that
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.000]   they have to wait till three when they could just get it off their plate now."
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:08.640]   They'll live.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.560]   They don't really care that they have to wait to three.
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.200]   They just care that there's some way they know that they're going to get an answer,
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.400]   so they don't have to worry about it.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.720]   But think about the mathematics here.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:23.920]   Imagine you have 10 conversations that each are going to require 10 back and forth messages
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.480]   in order for you to resolve, just to make the numbers easier.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.360]   That's 100 back and forth messages that have to happen.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.440]   Now, imagine if this is happening with emails going back and forth, you can't wait that
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.880]   long before each of these replies because you have to keep the conversations going.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:41.760]   So, maybe you check your inbox on average three times before you see each of these messages
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.040]   because you're waiting for them.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:48.560]   That's 300 inbox checks that we have now associated with these 10 conversations.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.160]   Now, imagine if instead, we put aside one hour of the day where you just boom, boom,
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.880]   boom, boom, boom, handled all 10 of those.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.160]   You've taken 300 context shifts out of your week.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:04.080]   That is a massive benefit to how much you can concentrate the value you're going to
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:04.720]   produce.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.240]   All of that work still got done.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.680]   All of that collaboration still happened.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:11.360]   At worst case scenario, people have to wait a couple hours, but you have just become 5x
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.040]   more effective in terms of the actual underlying value you can produce.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.200]   So, you came across a very simple idea that is really, really powerful.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.280]   Is it most effective when the whole company adopts the same office hours?
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:27.040]   It's like, "Hey, we're all going to, as a company, solve these things from these two
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.640]   blocks of time every day."
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.520]   I've seen both.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.200]   There's some argument that says you should have coordination of office hours so that
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.800]   you can basically have impromptu meetings.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.040]   A bunch of people going back and forth.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.040]   But in practice, often people's office hours are more specialized and that's fine.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.200]   What it leads to is what I call a reverse meeting.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:50.400]   So, instead of me being able to take three people and force all of you to come to me
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.480]   and spend an hour of your time.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:56.960]   So, now we have four total people sacrificing an hour of their time so that we can discuss
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:57.680]   some issue.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:03.040]   A reverse meeting is I go to each of your office hours to talk to you about this and
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:03.840]   figure it out.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:09.360]   Yes, I had to spend more time, but the total impact on the company's time is much less
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.320]   because for everyone else, you just stop by their office hours and chat with them for
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:12.880]   five minutes.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:18.160]   So, even if you're not all synchronized, reverse meetings makes that a lot more powerful.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:24.640]   That's what one of the big solutions are for non-repeating, one-off ad hoc issues that
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.760]   need to be resolved.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:30.080]   For any type of work that happens again and again, we produce a podcast episode every
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:30.320]   week.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.720]   We put out this report to our clients once a month.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.400]   Anything that happens again and again, you have to figure out a process.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.160]   This is how this work unfolds.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:42.880]   Here's when we talk about it, where the information goes, how the information moves back and forth.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:47.600]   You have to come up with some sort of process for regularly occurring work that minimizes
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:52.960]   the number, and this I think is the key thing, minimizes the number of unscheduled messages
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:56.240]   that must be received and replied to get to done.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.440]   So, you're not trying to minimize the total time investment.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.600]   You're not trying to minimize the footprint on the schedule.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:05.600]   What you're trying to minimize, is there a way to get this podcast episode out or there's
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:10.320]   report to clients that does not require the people involved to just keep checking their
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.160]   inbox and waiting for messages.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.920]   Is it some sort of structure?
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.320]   This goes to this drop box by this time.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.640]   There's a standing meeting where we go through these issues.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.960]   We annotate report issues in Google Docs.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.920]   At end of day Wednesday, whatever's in there, the designer can take however you want to
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.480]   figure it out.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.000]   That I think is the goal for regularly occurring work.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.080]   How can we get this done in a way that people do not have to be checking inboxes or chat
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:35.840]   channels for unscheduled messages to arrive to prompt them to do the next thing?
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:41.520]   I feel like I am ready to redo a few structures and processes specifically related to getting
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.720]   podcast episodes out.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.640]   So, that covers a lot of the work I have to think about.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:49.920]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.720]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:57.920]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals, and discounts from our partners, you can go to
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.800]   allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:04.080]   So, please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.040]   I want to change gears a little bit and talk about not work.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.560]   We talked about the deep life and how important it is to think about the things outside of
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:11.280]   work.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.680]   You talk about high quality leisure time.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:18.000]   How do you spend your free time in ways that adds the most value also?
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:18.880]   We work backwards.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.280]   We're going to back up backwards in the high quality leisure.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:25.680]   The reason why someone like me who talks about technology and culture and technology and
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:31.840]   work and how do I end up talking about leisure is because if you start with the issue of
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.960]   people spending more time than they think is useful or healthy scrolling, right?
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.680]   And this is really the big issue I think people have with their phones.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:44.000]   Contrary to what we see in media criticism of things like social media, it's much less
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.680]   what they're seeing and it's much more how much time they're spending on it.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:53.280]   This is people's main complaint is this slack jaw, just I just am tired and just scrolling
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.720]   and it's playing with my emotions.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.920]   It just makes me unhappy.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.520]   I don't want to just be doing this.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.560]   How do you solve that problem?
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:04.000]   Well, one of the big things that turns up is that this doom scrolling or boredom scrolling
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.600]   or dopamine hacking or whatever you want to call it actually has a psychologically functional
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.080]   purpose.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:15.840]   The reason why a lot of people do this is because it is an escape from some sort of
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.600]   existential void that is really uncomfortable.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:23.920]   In other words, if you go up to someone and say, "Aha, I've solved your problem.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.320]   I called all the heads of the social media companies.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.840]   They've kicked you off all their platforms.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.680]   You're not allowed to use your phone anymore."
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:33.200]   What happens is it's frightening for people.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.200]   It's despairing for people to be faced with just me alone with my own thoughts.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.080]   What do I actually do?
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.520]   What do I do with my time?
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.880]   It's what we often miss is that this is an escape that is functional for people.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.000]   That's how I ended up talking about high-quality leisure is that if you don't like how much
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.800]   time you're looking at your phone, you have to build up the attractive alternative first.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.680]   You have to have the thing that's more human, more compelling,
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:59.680]   that touches deeper parts of our humanity than just scrolling on screens does.
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.600]   That has to be in place first.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.200]   And then it is much easier to walk away from excessive phone use because you have something
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.400]   else to do instead.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.800]   And so, that's why I've been an advocate of high-quality leisure is you have to actually
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:16.480]   develop a really high-quality life outside of work that you enjoy and is challenging
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.960]   and disciplined and meaningful before you have any hope of spending less time looking
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.160]   at that glowing little screen.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:26.720]   What are some high-quality leisure activities maybe for you or people you've talked to that
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.400]   can inspire us all?
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:32.880]   What makes an activity high-quality is that it's touching more the type of things that
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.280]   we expect as humans to fill our time.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:41.680]   So, certainly, non-trivial analog, social interaction, things that require non-trivial
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:42.960]   sacrifice of time and energy.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.640]   I'm spending time with other people.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.400]   I'm doing things with other people.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.600]   That is really important.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.000]   Structured discipline activities that makes you more capable or a better person.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.360]   This can be really rewarding.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:58.000]   So, this is fitness training, getting in shape, picking up useful skills.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.400]   You'll notice there's a certain circle of podcasters out there now that all really got
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:06.080]   into things like bow hunting or jujitsu at the same time.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.440]   It's not coincidental.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:12.720]   They're activities that are challenging but feel functional and they touch something deeper
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.160]   in our evolutionary past.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.600]   I can capture my own food or defend myself.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.360]   That could be really meaningful.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.280]   Cultivating connoisseurship.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:29.120]   So, I'm going to get really into, I don't know, coffee or movies and really build up
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:33.600]   a sophisticated understanding of what makes the good good and the not good not good.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:36.000]   There's huge pleasure in that and connoisseurship.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   And when you're a cinephile, the pleasure you get out of seeing a beautifully crafted
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.560]   movie is really difficult to replicate.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.080]   So, these are kind of the big categories.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:49.520]   So, just to summarize is deep social connection, real sort of social community-type connection.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:55.040]   Two, disciplined acquiring of what feels like useful, interesting skills.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.880]   And then three, building up connoisseurship.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:01.200]   Anything that falls in those three categories, it's much harder than scrolling, but it's
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.000]   no contest.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   When you're spending time doing that, it just feels.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.320]   You just feel it in your bones.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.680]   This is right.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.640]   This makes me come alive as a person, even if I'm exhausted and sweating.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:17.920]   This makes me come alive as a person in contrast to just the scrolling after scrolling on the
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.720]   screen tends to make us feel like we're closing down.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:25.600]   Like something about our humanity is just being digitized and cybernetically subverted.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.960]   People just feel it in their bones.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:31.440]   And I ran this whole experiment for one of my books where I had 1600 people walk away
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:36.800]   from their screens for a month and very aggressively cultivate these new leisure activities.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.200]   And it's just a report you got again and again.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:43.520]   I forgot how much I enjoyed X or how meaningful Y has been.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.560]   It was leaving Plato's cave.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.360]   Oh my god, it's not just shadows on the wall.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.560]   There's actual sunlight and that world is so much richer.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:57.360]   When I heard you describe social media, not necessarily as the content, but the activity,
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.920]   it reminded me of binge watching a TV show.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.520]   And then you use the cinephile example as okay, well, movies could actually be this
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.640]   high quality leisure.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:11.600]   Do you think that habit of loving a show and watching an entire season at once could actually
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:16.560]   be high quality or does it end up falling prey to be more like social media?
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:17.760]   Yeah, it can go either way.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.040]   I think it's a really good example.
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:23.040]   So, for someone who is a cinephile or really is interested in that particular art form,
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:27.280]   watching a great show on HBO can be like a really rewarding thing.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:33.680]   On the other hand, if it is I am binge watching whatever, How I Met My Mother episodes for
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:39.600]   the third time because I just don't want to deal with me feeling down on myself and I'm
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.480]   going to do that for the next two hours, it can be really negative.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.000]   And I think that's a really good example.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   And it's the same thing with obviously internet and social media or all these various tools.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.920]   When they're deployed on behalf of something important to you, they're really powerful.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.600]   When they're used as a numbing mechanism, it's really negative.
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.960]   If you're a whiskey connoisseur, whiskey could be a really positive thing.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:02.800]   Like, wow, I just tried this new whiskey that this new distillery did and they're doing
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   something great and it's really interesting.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:08.560]   Or you're pounding Jack Daniels, it could be really negative, right?
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:12.400]   So, I think there is this duality, this dichotomy to a lot of these activities.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:16.640]   I think recognizing that makes it a more sensible conversation.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.640]   It's not useful when you get into these debates about these false binaries.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:21.680]   Is technology terrible?
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.640]   Is technology good?
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:27.280]   Though I'll say, I don't actually ever see anyone arguing any of those points.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:30.720]   You never actually come across anyone who says technology is terrible, we shouldn't
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.400]   use it or all technology is good.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:36.320]   Yet almost every book or article on techno criticism makes it feel like that's what the
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.520]   whole world is doing.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.960]   Whereas a lot of people are out there just saying technology is terrible or technology
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:43.840]   is great, but I'm so smart and nuanced, I think it's somewhere in between.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:45.280]   Everyone knows it's in between.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.600]   No one is actually arguing those extreme positions.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.440]   No one is saying let's disconnect electricity.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:53.200]   No one is saying that it's great for 12-year-olds to be spending three hours on TikTok every
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:53.760]   day.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.600]   We're all actually already in the middle.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:59.120]   This little pet peeve of mine is that everyone always makes it seem like there's some sort
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.800]   of intellectual hero for saying, "I'm not a Luddite."
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.440]   There hasn't been Luddites for the last 150 years.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.360]   It doesn't impress me anymore for someone to say that.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:12.640]   Now, I will push back and say I have seen a TED Talk you gave telling people you should
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.240]   get off social media, which is the full get completely off.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:19.680]   Now, maybe that's a provocative example to get people to experience it.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:20.240]   Exactly.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.920]   But I know you're not on it.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:26.240]   Do you think that it has some positive applications when used in particular ways?
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:31.840]   So, my philosophy is called digital minimalism, where the whole idea is you figure out first
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.800]   what you're all about, what's important to you, what you want to do with your life and
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.600]   your time.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:40.400]   And then you work backwards from that to say, "What's the best way to deploy technology
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.000]   to support these things I care about?"
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.720]   And the answer to that question is what decides what tech you use.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.280]   So, that's ultimately what I preach.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.760]   And so, everyone's going to have their own profile of technology.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.760]   I don't really care about the specifics so much as I care about how you get there.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:59.600]   So, the minimalist mindset is I deploy technology in specific ways to gain specific benefits
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.560]   that are important to me.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:06.880]   That contrast to what a lot of people do instead, which is maximalism, which is why not use
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:07.680]   this technology?
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:11.040]   Or there might be something interesting over here.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.480]   So, why don't I do that too?
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.840]   It's sort of like it can't hurt.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:14.640]   I don't want to miss out.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.320]   So, let me just use everything.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.800]   You'll drown if you try maximalism.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.480]   Minimalism is much more focused.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.480]   And so, everyone's going to end up differently.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:26.640]   When I go through the minimalist exercise, I didn't end up seeing a real powerful use
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.240]   for the standard social media platforms.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:32.000]   I never had a Facebook account or Instagram account or Twitter account.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.920]   But I think YouTube is a powerful medium.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:37.120]   And we release video of my podcasts on YouTube.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.560]   I'm a big believer in podcasts.
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.960]   I've had a blog and email newsletters for a long time.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.440]   So, you end up with a very customized portfolio.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.960]   It's the intention that I care about.
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.640]   Why are you using technology?
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:50.160]   You can set reasonable guardrails about how you use it and you'll get more benefit than
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:50.880]   cost.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.160]   If you stumble in the technology, the cost is probably going to outweigh the benefit.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.760]   It's interesting.
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.360]   You just made me feel a lot better about my use of Twitter because I've kind of curated
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:05.440]   a particular list of a handful of more or less like news sources that I don't want to
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:08.000]   go to their sites and look at every article and stuff.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.080]   I want a quick way to almost use Twitter as an RSS reader because I think it's like the
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:16.880]   most efficient way for me to have a finite list of things to look at from 20 or so news
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:22.400]   sources that I'm interested in, whether they're newsletters or blogs or actual media companies
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.360]   and publications.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.720]   That's my primary use of Twitter.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.960]   I think coming into this, I was like, "Oh man, I feel bad about it."
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.480]   Now, I feel actually a little bit better about it.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.440]   So, thank you.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.760]   Oh, that's a great example because you don't just use Twitter as not a binary thing.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:38.800]   You don't say, "Oh, because I get interesting news on Twitter, I just use Twitter all the
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:42.160]   time for all purposes, and I'm on there yelling with trolls and doing this type of thing."
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.360]   Because you know why you're using Twitter, you can put guardrails up.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:50.960]   "Oh, if I use it because it's an RSS feed for news sources, and a lot of news sources
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:55.280]   will post on their Twitter all their big stories," then you just curate who you follow down to
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:55.760]   those lists.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:59.040]   There's no reason why you would ever be tweeting at people.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.400]   You don't get dragged into weird pylons or fights.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.840]   That's the magic of minimalism.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.000]   If you know why you use it, you can put up rules.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.760]   The other big example is Facebook groups.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:13.440]   A lot of people use Facebook groups for specific, often local organizations that are very important
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.160]   to them.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:18.000]   But if they recognize that's why they're using Facebook for the Facebook group, they realize,
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.680]   "I don't need to be on the news feed.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:23.120]   And I can use a plugin that just eradicates the news feed, and I don't need Facebook on
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.920]   my phone because I just need to check when the next group meeting is.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.520]   I can do that on my desktop.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:31.440]   And my total time on Facebook is six minutes a week.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.640]   And it's really useful to me because when I know that Facebook's groups is why I'm using
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:40.080]   Facebook, I realize there's no reason to be scrolling through my uncle's political rants
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:43.040]   while waiting in line to get my burrito."
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:46.960]   Because if you know why you're using a technology, you can focus how you use it.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.720]   And there's a real advantage in that.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.720]   What do you do when you're waiting in line for the burrito?
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.560]   Is that practicing boredom?
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:56.880]   What are you sitting there in line doing, whether it's on your phone, in your thoughts?
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:57.840]   Do you have an activity?
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.120]   Well, so when you're practicing boredom, you don't have to do it all the time.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:04.000]   You just want to make sure you do it on a semi-regular basis.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.120]   On one of your burrito runs every day, practice the boredom.
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:10.880]   But you don't want to see boredom as being intrinsically valuable.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:16.000]   That's one place I differ from some others in that I think boredom feels really negative.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   Anything that feels really negative, that's usually a pretty strong evolutionary signal
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.840]   that there's something going on here that we want to avoid.
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:27.680]   So, I think our minds actually use the sense of boredom to try to spur us into productive
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:32.800]   activities, perhaps is why humans, even when they have food in the cave, get up and go
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.160]   out and invent the wheel.
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.120]   We feel boredom.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.640]   I don't think cats do, right?
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.520]   So, I'm not one of these people who thinks boredom is great and you should feel it all
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:39.920]   the time.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:42.560]   So, yeah, you can entertain yourself in the line for the burrito.
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.360]   It could mean a lot of things.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:44.960]   It could be listening to the podcast.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.920]   I think it's completely fine.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:47.520]   I'm listening to an interesting conversation.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.480]   Chris and Cal are talking.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.760]   I want to hear what they have to say.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.600]   It could be bringing a book with you.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:56.240]   I have friends who started a company called Mouse Books, which I really enjoy.
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.000]   You get them in a subscription.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.520]   They print books.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:04.560]   It's usually short stories or heavily abridged books in a paper format roughly the size of
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:05.360]   a smartphone.
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:08.320]   And their whole pitch is, it fits wherever your smartphone would fit.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:12.080]   So, when you would pull out your smartphone, just pull out the latest Mouse Book instead
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:15.600]   and you can actually read wherever you are.
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:18.880]   And so, yeah, boredom is not a virtue.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:22.960]   But what you want to avoid is never experiencing it.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:27.440]   Or B, I just get really suspicious with numbing behavior.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:30.560]   So, if it's just, "Ugh, I'm just scrolling and it's numbing me."
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:32.640]   I get worried about it.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.280]   If you're like, "Yeah, when I'm bored in line, I start drinking."
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.480]   I'm like, "Yeah, it'll numb you a little bit, but I don't know if this is the healthiest
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:38.800]   thing."
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:39.840]   Maybe there's other things to do.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:46.160]   I'm all for boredom spurring productive activity, but maybe amplifying the level of productivity
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:51.280]   to something a little bit higher on some occasions than simply let this algorithmically constructed
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:56.960]   stream just start playing my brainstem like some sort of nervous system harpsichord or
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:57.520]   something like this.
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:02.400]   I want to talk a little bit about how you end your day because I read something that
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:06.160]   I think was an older post of yours about your routine at the end of the day.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.400]   I think it was like, "Schedule shutdown complete."
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:13.600]   I'm curious if you still use that as a way to wrap up the workday and draw things to
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.080]   a close.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:20.080]   Yeah, you need a clear distinction between workday and non-workday just from a cognitive
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.440]   hygiene perspective.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:25.280]   And so, what I've always preached as a shutdown ritual where you have to close all the open
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.080]   loops.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.600]   Okay, am I missing anything?
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.360]   Let me do a final check of my inbox.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.520]   Look at my calendar and my plan.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.560]   What am I doing tomorrow?
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.600]   Does my plan make sense?
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.960]   Am I good?
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.440]   Am I good to stop working, right?
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:43.040]   So, you want to do a sweep like that so you can switch from work to non-work.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.040]   The problem is your brain, especially at first, is not going to trust that.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.160]   And so, when you stop working, your brain will be like, "Are we sure?
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.280]   Let's think through our plan.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.200]   And what about our boss sent that email?
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.720]   Did we really send him the right response?
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.680]   Maybe he's mad.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.120]   And are we forgetting this?"
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.880]   Your mind wants to keep talking and thinking about work, which is difficult.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.760]   It drains your energy.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.440]   It makes it hard to enjoy other parts of your life.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:09.040]   So, the secret here is to have an unusual hook that you use to indicate that you've
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.000]   finished your sweep.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.800]   And so, I famously used a phrase, "Schedule shutdown complete."
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.880]   I now sell a time block planner that has a checkbox.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.800]   So, for people who don't want to actually say that phrase and attract the scorn or concern
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.000]   people around them, it actually has a shutdown complete checkbox.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.400]   But the point is, it's a unique demonstrable activity.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.240]   So, whether you're saying that weird phrase or checking off a very specific checkbox,
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.920]   it's clear and demonstrable and unique.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:41.200]   The whole reason why you do that is that later in the night, when the work mind tries to
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.000]   come in and say, "What about, are we sure?
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.520]   Like, what about tomorrow and our boss?"
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:49.360]   You say, "I said that stupid phrase or I checked that checkbox.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.400]   There's no way I would have done that if I had not gone through everything and convinced
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.160]   myself that it was fine to shut down.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.360]   So, I'm not going to get into this rumination with you tonight, mind.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.640]   I said the stupid phrase.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.280]   I trust it."
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:03.840]   And the point is, you do that enough times, you're not feeding the beast.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.880]   And that urge to ruminate about work after work is done, eventually diminishes.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.760]   So, it's a way of calming rumination without engaging.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.000]   If you engage it and say, "No, no, look, here's our plan.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.600]   Let's go over the plan again and again."
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.280]   You give it power and the rumination gets more powerful.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.160]   It gets more energy.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.440]   The groove gets deeper.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:25.280]   But if you don't engage it and said like, "I'm not going to get into any of the specifics
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.480]   of this cognitive concern.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:31.200]   I'm just going to go back and say I would not have said schedule shutdown complete unless
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.040]   I'd gone through everything, convinced myself it was okay."
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:37.360]   It's a way of actually tamping down rumination and actually getting some cognitive peace
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.800]   outside of your work hours.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.160]   What happens when you're at that end of the workday, but you're not done?
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.760]   There are things that need to get done.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.560]   For example, I release an episode every Wednesday.
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.760]   And I now have 2 kids as of a couple weeks ago.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:53.520]   And it's like, "Okay, well, we're all sitting down to dinner at X and I'm not done.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.440]   I can't check the box."
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:02.240]   Any tricks or routines or ways to come back to that in a healthy manner when you know
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.600]   you're not going to be able to finish before you wanted?
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:09.440]   Yeah, so for second shift work like that, usually what works well is, okay, you go through
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.000]   your first, they call it a provisional shutdown.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.760]   You're shutting down most of the open loops, especially the open loops about is there emails
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.480]   I'm missing?
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.400]   Is my plan for the week makes sense?
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:23.200]   And you set up at the end of that initial provisional shutdown, here's what I'm doing
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:23.920]   later.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.360]   And it's very focused.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.600]   I have to get this episode out.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:28.800]   Here's where the files are.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.600]   That's what I'm doing.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:30.480]   I'm not doing email.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.200]   I'm not doing slides.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.360]   It's very focused what has to happen later tonight.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.440]   So, I'm doing a scheduled shutdown on the open loops are closed for the day.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.120]   I have a plan for tonight.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.600]   I know when that's happening, what has to happen there.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.280]   And so, now I can go back to my kids and know when it gets to eight and I have to switch
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.160]   over to the second plan.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.960]   I'm just executing this sort of focus thing I've set aside.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.640]   And I don't even have to do a second shutdown after that second shift because I've already
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.120]   done that after the first shift.
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.960]   Like, are we good?
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.600]   Yeah, I can do this tonight and we'll pick it up tomorrow.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.640]   You've looked at the whole plan.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.920]   You've looked at the email inbox.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.600]   You've done that all with the first shutdown.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.960]   And then the second shift is like a focus thing you come and do when you're done, you're
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:07.280]   done.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.720]   And that's what I usually recommend.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.160]   The only other thing I'll recommend to people, though, is if you're consistently doing that
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:16.880]   second shift, if possible, end your first shift earlier.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:21.120]   Think about, I want the sum of all the work I do in the day to add up to a reasonable
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:21.920]   amount of hours.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.840]   And that's just a burnout prevention tool.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.680]   If you're like, "I'm not gonna be able to get this done.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.400]   Can I end work a little earlier?
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.320]   If I know I always work on this in the evenings or I record my podcast in the evenings, why
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.720]   don't I end my day work earlier?"
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:38.160]   So, the total sum of effort, if possible, remains reasonable.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.600]   I really like that.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.440]   I might try that this week.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.920]   We're recording this on a Tuesday.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.120]   I know I'm going to get an episode out tonight.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:47.920]   So, maybe I'm going to end it early, spend some time with the family.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:51.440]   Which leads me to ask this quick follow-up, which is you have more kids than me.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.240]   I learned a math lesson with our second child that two is a greater number than one.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.680]   And you've learned that as well.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:03.600]   I'm curious how any of these things you've written about, things you've talked about
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:09.840]   have changed in a world with children where time is more of a finite resource.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.280]   I've had kids now for a little while.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.280]   I'll come to a decade now of wrangling kids.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:17.440]   So, a lot of these ideas actually got developed in that crucible.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:20.720]   And I think that's actually not surprising because one of the things that becomes clear
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:25.040]   when you have kids and you have a job and you're trying to balance what's going on
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:30.720]   with your spouse, et cetera, is you need more structure and clarity about your time.
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.240]   You know, you can't just wing it.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.920]   Now, it suddenly matters.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:34.400]   When am I work?
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.360]   When do I need to be done at work?
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.120]   Do I need to go pick up someone from here?
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.640]   Do I have to drop someone off here?
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.680]   I think that's probably one of the origins of thinking through, let's say, time block
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.240]   scheduling.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:45.040]   You got to suddenly be clear about your time.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:48.320]   Work is not just this generic thing you try to do as much as possible about.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.560]   No, you have time that you have to allocate among different priorities.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.440]   Some professional ones, some family ones, some personal ones.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.200]   What's the best possible allocation?
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.560]   So, I think that's really important.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:02.240]   I'm a big believer in fixed schedule productivity, which I think kids really hammer home.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.360]   Where you fix in advance.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.720]   Here's how much time I have to work.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.120]   That is non-negotiable.
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.960]   So, I have to work backwards from that to figure out how to make everything work.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.800]   And maybe that's going to have to make me more efficient.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.560]   Maybe that means I'm going to have to take things off my plate.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.800]   Maybe that means I'm going to have to change my professional situation.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:21.600]   But you work backwards from a fixed amount of time and say, "What can I do with that?"
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.600]   That often leads to a lot of innovation.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.880]   So, I think that's important.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.240]   And obviously, having kids really emphasizes the importance that work is just
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.880]   one aspect in a deeper life.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.840]   It's not the sole source of meaning.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:37.120]   So, you want to give work its place and do what you can with it.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.200]   But you want that place to be controlled and have these other parts of life as well.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:47.200]   It's a final point I'll say is kids are a big source of my millennial generation
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.760]   who are now all of the age, are all having kids.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.720]   I'm an old millennial.
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.760]   I'm about to turn 40.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.800]   They're all in their 30s now.
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.640]   They're all having kids, starting families.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.720]   I think it's a big driver of discontent with social media because when you have these other
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:02.320]   things in your life that are important and demanding and require your attention,
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:07.920]   suddenly spending a lot of time doing this to escape seems like it's almost an existential
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.160]   threat.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:11.680]   This is a big threat in a way that if you're 24, you're like, "Whatever.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.240]   Why not?
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:12.640]   I'm bored.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.680]   Why not just look at this thing?"
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.320]   So, I don't know.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:18.880]   I think having kids has probably shaped a lot of my thinking and can help a lot of other
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.600]   people start thinking about these issues as well.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:26.240]   It's definitely drived a lot of my desire to be more optimal with my time, my days,
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.520]   my travel.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.360]   Layovers are not nearly as tolerable as they once were.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:32.400]   It's shaped a lot of things.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.200]   On that note of travel, our listeners really love travel.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.560]   They love getting tips from our guests.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:40.960]   So, I'm going to ask you before we go to pick a place you're familiar with and share
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:46.080]   some recommendations for a meal, a place to grab a drink, or some unusual activity someone
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:46.800]   should check out.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.720]   Maybe I'll pitch where I am right now.
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:53.120]   I mentioned I found this small 19th century town that is just nestled right in the middle
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.480]   of all the DC sprawl.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.920]   So, I'll give it a pitch.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:01.680]   The town is called Tacoma Park, spelled with a K instead of a C. It's a cool little town.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.560]   It has a metro stop and it's right across the boundary.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.840]   But I'm recording right now.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:10.720]   My studio is above a restaurant in downtown Tacoma Park called Republic.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.440]   The bar is right below here.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.120]   We don't yet have the dumb waiter working, but I'm working on that innovation.
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:21.200]   I want to be able to just bring the drink up as we're finishing here.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:26.320]   Great nestled out of the beaten path of the city in the suburbs, a great restaurant.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:30.880]   Down the street from here is where I do a large amount of my writing is a coffee shop.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:34.880]   Shout out to Bevco, just celebrating their five-year anniversary.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:41.520]   So, I live a couple blocks away from my studio, this restaurant, and that coffee shop.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:45.920]   And between the three of those, that's where you get deep work done.
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.120]   That's where productivity comes from.
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.840]   So, you should definitely give Tacoma Park a visit next time you're in the DC area.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.880]   And if you swing by Bevco, you'll probably see me in a corner somewhere
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.240]   wrangling a New Yorker article trying to edit a book.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.880]   And definitely don't interrupt you because you're in the middle of some deep work.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.360]   Yes, you're going to get coffee in your face.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.800]   Awesome. Well, thank you so much for being here.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.080]   Where do you want people to go to find everything you're reading,
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.960]   writing, producing, talking about on your show?
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.120]   So, I have that newsletter I've talked about.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.840]   You can find out about that at calnewport.com.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:22.480]   And on my weekly podcast, which is called Deep Questions with Cal Newport.
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:24.320]   So, you can find that where podcasts are.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:29.920]   We release the full podcast episodes as video and clips of the podcast as video.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.280]   That's all on YouTube at youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:36.000]   Really, the only places to find me because I don't use any of the other services.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.880]   Great. We will link to all those on the show notes.
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.160]   Definitely check out the podcast.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.280]   I know I enjoyed it a lot.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:44.560]   The last few weeks, I went pretty deep to get to know you a little better.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.400]   So, thank you so much for being here.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.600]   Well, thanks for having me. I enjoyed it.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.960]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.720]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:57.680]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:59.280]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.200]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me, or just want to say hi,

[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:20.400]   I'll see you next week.
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.460]   you
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:32.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
