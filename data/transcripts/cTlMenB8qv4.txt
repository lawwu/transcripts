[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   The scripture delivers many warnings to the wealthy, but are those warnings also directed
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.080]   at middle-class Americans? It's a really good question from an anonymous woman. "Pastor
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.640]   John, whenever I read James 5 about the wailing and misery awaiting the rich of this world,
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.680]   I am filled with fear for the judgment day. I am a middle-class American with the usual
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.160]   comforts of the life of the middle class, three square meals a day, unnecessary treats,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.320]   desserts, coffee, entertainment through our big screen television, occasional vacations,
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.000]   far more clothing than I need, a comfortable bed with fine sheets, a decorated home, and
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.080]   the list goes on. People might look at me and think I'm not decadent. I live in a small
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.400]   house in a modest neighborhood, but I know that I am the rich of this world compared
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.520]   to the majority. I do use many of my belongings and worldly comforts to serve others with
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.840]   the gift of hospitality, and I love the Lord and consider myself a strong believer and
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.800]   follower of Christ. But I also know that I could live on way less, sacrificing to give
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.040]   away more than I already do. I tithe regularly and give to charitable organizations, but
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.720]   it is always with me that I could give so much more by giving up many more comforts.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.720]   I struggle with feeling peace with God when I feel that He will judge me harshly for living
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.680]   as comfortably as I do. I'm wondering if God wants me to give up the pleasures and
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.320]   comforts that this country offers.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:35.360]   This question feels unusually timely to me because just yesterday when I was doing table
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:43.240]   talk with the seminary students over at Bethlehem College and Seminary, one of the students
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.920]   basically asked this exact same question. And the question seems to boil down to this.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.840]   How can we know whether the level of wartime simplicity for the sake of Christ-exalting
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.040]   ministry is the level it should be? How can we know we've found the right level of wartime
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.040]   simplicity?
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.400]   Now, just a reminder to those who haven't heard these categories before, the reason
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.120]   I refer to wartime simplicity as opposed to simplicity by itself is because simplicity
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.800]   alone might lead you to renounce all modern appliances and devices and machines for the
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.040]   smallest possible carbon footprint and move out, might lead you to move out of a mechanized
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.520]   urban setting into a rural agrarian setting where you can raise your own food and possibly
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.760]   become totally self-absorbed and do no good for anybody while being supremely simple in
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.560]   your lifestyle. That's not our goal.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.840]   Whereas what I mean by wartime simplicity is that we picture ourselves in a spiritual
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.720]   war in this globe where the battle is not only against the sins of materialism and consumerism
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:18.200]   and self-indulgence, which it is, but also the battle is for reaching the neighborhoods
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:27.040]   and the nations of the world with the gospel. There's a very big, big task before us to
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.880]   achieve, and that conception of the Christian life as a massive challenge to reach the world
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:43.680]   with the gospel might incline you to own a computer, just like the Second World War inclined
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.680]   America to save every bobby pin so that they could build B-52s, which cost millions of
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:59.400]   dollars. It was wartime simplicity to stop a basketball game to find a bobby pin, which
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.920]   happened, or not change your tires for X number of years because they needed all the rubber
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.800]   in the war effort. That was simplicity, but it wasn't peacetime simplicity like everybody
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.320]   be as non-mechanistic as possible.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.160]   So back to the question, how can we know whether the level of wartime simplicity for the sake
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.320]   of Christ-exalting, nation-reaching ministry is the level it should be? And before I say
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.800]   anything else more specifically, let me refer everybody to Randy Alcorn's little book, The
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:40.840]   Treasure Principle. I think Randy Alcorn has been raised up in our day as one of the most
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:49.640]   helpful, humble, wise, authentic spokesmen on the issue of money and how to think about
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.560]   it. And if people want to ponder what I've thought more fully, they can go to the chapter
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.320]   on money, which is called The Currency of Christian Hedonism in the book Desiring God.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.920]   But I would especially have people really get to know Randy Alcorn if they're struggling
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:14.000]   with issues of stewardship and money and lifestyle and so on. This is one of those questions,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.920]   I think, that in the Bible has no precise answer. I mean, the Bible doesn't resolve
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:32.800]   the question of how much we should own and how much we should give and use by giving
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:40.640]   quantitative answers, like percentages. I don't think the tithe is an answer to anything.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:47.560]   That's just a starting point for Christians, I think. And lots more than that should be
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:55.440]   on the table, like everything. The rich young ruler was told he needed to sell everything.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.880]   That's what it meant for him to follow Jesus, Mark 10:21. Zacchaeus gave away half of his
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.280]   goods to the poor, and Jesus said, "Salvation came to this house today," when he watched
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:16.080]   that happen, Luke 19.9. Jesus said in Luke 14.33 that in order to be his disciple, we
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:24.280]   must renounce everything that we have, renounce everything. And he said we must love him,
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.960]   himself, more than we love our dearest relation, Matthew 10.37. And he said the kingdom of
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.280]   heaven is like finding a treasure and selling everything you have to have that treasure,
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:44.280]   Matthew 13.44. And Paul said, "As for the rich in this present age, charge them not
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.680]   to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:55.680]   provides everything to enjoy. They are to do good, be rich in good works, to be generous
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.800]   and ready to share and store up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.760]   so that they may take hold of life, which is life indeed." So it seems to me the New
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.360]   Testament doesn't give one prescription, it doesn't give one line, it doesn't make
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.440]   the answer easy, it doesn't answer it in quantitative numbers, it gives a relentless
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:26.960]   push. This is really something to take into consideration. The New Testament gives a relentless
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:36.480]   push toward a wartime simplicity and economy for the sake of the kingdom, away from luxury
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.720]   and affluence and finery. Let me just bullet a bunch of text so you feel, you'll see
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:50.220]   what I mean by the force of wartime summons. Luke 18.14, "They are choked by the riches
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.240]   and pleasures of life." Luke 9.48, "The Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:00.560]   Luke 12.15, "A person's life does not consist in the possessions he has." Matthew
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.080]   6.19, "Don't lay up for yourselves treasures on earth." Matthew 6.33, "Seek the kingdom
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.240]   first and the other things will be added." Luke 12.20, "The man who built bigger and
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:17.800]   bigger barns," Jesus says, "Fool, this night your soul will be required of you."
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.120]   Luke 12.33, "Sell your possessions, give alms, provide for yourselves purses in heaven."
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.520]   Luke 18.24, "How hard it is for those who have riches to get into the kingdom of heaven."
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:34.600]   Acts 2.45, "They sold their possessions and distributed them to the poor." 2 Corinthians
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:41.240]   6.9, "We are poor, though making many rich. We have nothing, and yet we possess everything."
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:47.480]   2 Corinthians 8.2, "In a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:54.440]   extreme poverty overflowed in a wealth of liberality." Ephesians 4.28, "Let him
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.960]   labor, working with his hands, that he may have to him who is in need." So you can
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.560]   yield, that's one option. You can work to have, that's another option. Or Paul's
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.320]   option is you can work to have in order to give. 1 Timothy 6.7, "We brought nothing
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.840]   into the world. We can't take anything out of the world, so we're going to be content
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.960]   with what we have, food and clothing." Hebrews 13.5, "Keep your life free from the love
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:25.800]   of money." James 2.5, "Has not God chosen those who are poor in this world to be rich
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:31.360]   in faith?" 1 John 3.17, "If anyone has this world's goods and sees his brother
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.600]   in need and closes his heart to him, how does the love of God abide in him?" That's
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:41.080]   just a sampling. I don't think it's possible to take all that biblical teaching about money
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:47.200]   and find a clear line between wartime simplicity and peacetime luxury. I don't think the
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:54.320]   line is clear at all. Therefore, my approach, both in preaching and in my own life, is to
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:01.240]   return again and again and again, just like we've done now, to the relentless thrust
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:08.600]   of the New Testament toward loving and fruitful, other-oriented, sacrificial simplicity for
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:16.760]   the sake of kingdom advance. Riches are dangerous. That message is everywhere. And simplicity
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:23.640]   for its own sake is worthless, because love is what counts. Doing good, not going without.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.280]   Doing good, not going without. That's what counts. I know there are people who've
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:33.000]   given themselves to way more simplicity than I've seen others do, and they're loveless.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.520]   And the people that have more are very more loving, and good is coming from their lives.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:45.480]   So immerse yourself in the New Testament summons to love people, not money, to love simple
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:52.040]   beauties, not luxurious status symbols. That's just so crucial. The world is begging us constantly
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:11:00.640]   to love status symbols instead of simple beauties. And learn with Paul the secret of such profound
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:07.680]   contentment in Jesus that you know how to be abased and how to abound and can be like
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:15.440]   the Christians in Hebrews 10:34, "You had compassion on the prisoners, and you joyfully
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:22.520]   accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew, you knew you had a better
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.080]   possession and an abiding one."
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:32.840]   Loving simple beauties and not status symbols of luxury. It's such a great challenge and
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.060]   a glorious calling in this life. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for making the

[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.760]   Speaking of very good Bible questions, can we just skip over those few bits of the New
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.000]   Testament that seem to have been added to the original manuscripts? I'm thinking of
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.440]   sections like John 7, verse 53, through John 8, verse 11. It's a great question. Up next
