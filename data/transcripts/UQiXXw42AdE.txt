[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Let's talk about oxytocin.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.420]   We hear about it as the love hormone,
[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.760]   the affiliative hormone.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.480]   Folks, it's a neuro hormone,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.960]   so it's somewhere in between a neuromodulator and a hormone.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.120]   Let's set all that aside, all the mechanistic stuff,
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.720]   and I'd love to know your knowledge
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.280]   about what changing levels of oxytocin does
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.160]   to perception, to behavior, humans.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.540]   - So yeah, oxytocin, we've been interested in it
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.280]   for a long time because, as you said,
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.080]   it seems to be a dial that can turn up or turn down
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.440]   certain aspects of social behavior
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.280]   and other aspects of mental and emotional function.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.440]   It's important to point out that oxytocin
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.720]   and its sister neuro hormone, vasopressin,
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.200]   arginine vasopressin, which is sort of maybe
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.040]   a little more important in males than in females,
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.640]   and females, oxytocin's a little more important,
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.400]   but they're in both, and they've been around a long time.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.320]   They've actually, you know,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.820]   there's a very early invertebrate evolution.
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.080]   In mammals, oxytocin has the primary role, right,
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.240]   of helping to build bonds between mom and baby,
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240]   so oxytocin's released during childbirth,
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.680]   it's released when mom is nursing,
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.960]   and it seems that in humans and some other social,
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.040]   you know, really, really social creatures,
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.240]   it's now been co-opted to kind of have
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.440]   a similar kind of role in the relationships you have
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.700]   with other people who are not your offspring
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.400]   or your pairmate, right, 'cause oxytocin, for example,
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.080]   is released, you know, when you orgasm,
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.400]   and so, and that's, you know, thought to be why
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.720]   that sort of pillow talk afterward is, you know,
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.400]   like, it's more engaging, and, you know,
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.800]   people feel things at that time that they might have,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.760]   that are different from what they would have felt
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.080]   before that. - It fosters attachment.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.640]   - Fosters attachment, that's a good way of putting it.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.480]   So, oxytocin levels are hard to measure, right?
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.920]   You can measure it at a distance in the periphery,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.800]   in the blood, but it's not exactly, like,
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.600]   one-to-one correlated with what's going on in the brain,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.640]   and in general, we don't wanna put, like a, you know,
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.040]   a pump or a little thing in your brain
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.880]   that we could measure how much is in there.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.520]   So, we can look at, instead, what is often done
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.360]   is to look at what happens if you introduce oxytocin,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.840]   more oxytocin than you normally have, like, into the brain.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.560]   You can't inject it or anything like that,
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.920]   and the way that it's typically applied
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.280]   is to squirt it up your nose, or inhale it intranasally,
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.440]   so it then is taken up by the nerves
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.880]   that are in your sinuses and whatnot,
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.080]   and then goes into the brain.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.320]   That was what it was thought to,
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.760]   I think, that we were the first to show
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.720]   that that's actually how it works.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.080]   We did all the work in monkeys,
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.080]   where it's, all these things are just sort of easier to do,
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.440]   and the behavior's a little bit less complex,
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.760]   so our readouts are, I think, a bit more straightforward.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.160]   In the human studies, there's a lot of, you know,
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.220]   it's controversial, 'cause there's a lot of, like,
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.440]   there's some crap studies,
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.600]   and there's just a lot of variability
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.560]   in the effects across studies,
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.600]   and I think some of that's just because
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.960]   you ask people to squirt it up their own noses,
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.960]   and so there's a lot of, that introduces variation
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.000]   in just how good they were at getting it in the right place.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.080]   With the monkeys, what we did instead
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.280]   is we used what's called a nebulizer or aerosolizer.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.720]   Like, I had noticed when, like, my kid had, like, pneumonia,
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.720]   and I took him to the ER, they put this mask on him,
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.640]   and they, you know, they missed this albuterol,
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.600]   which opened up his airways.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.000]   Oh, we could do that with oxytocin, too,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.880]   so that's what we did with the monkeys.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.600]   It makes sure they get, like, a really good dose,
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.480]   and then we showed that that gets right into the brain.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.000]   Okay, now that puts us in a position
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.520]   to ask questions of what does it do.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.720]   Well, one of the first things that oxytocin does
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.400]   is it relaxes you, so just overall, you know,
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.800]   you were talking about autonomic function.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.880]   It's a relaxer.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.880]   It's an anxiolytic, so it, and in monkeys,
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.520]   what that does is it reduces their vigilance
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.760]   to sort of any threats, so they're just a lot more chill,
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.920]   so that's sort of a primary thing,
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.800]   and then we've looked at how it affects their behavior
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.960]   in males and females separately,
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.840]   because as I said before, they sort of,
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.640]   first of all, males and females have different strategies
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.640]   and behaviors and the expression
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.120]   of where oxytocin receptors are in the brain, et cetera,
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.360]   and vasopressin receptors are a little bit different,
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.160]   and in male monkeys, it's super interesting,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.280]   because, you know, we've been talking about how,
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.080]   you know, dominance, and they're really,
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.800]   like rhesus macaques have this really steep hierarchy,
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.360]   and one of the things we found right away
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.160]   is that you give oxytocin and it just flattens the hierarchy,
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.200]   so the dominant male monkeys become
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.480]   super chill and friendly,
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.160]   and the subordinate ones become a bit bolder,
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.120]   perhaps because, you know, when, if I dose,
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.560]   if I dosed my own, or I've dosed you with oxytocin,
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.040]   it'd change your behavior, which would change my behavior,
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.760]   so it reverberates across individuals,
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.440]   so it flattens the hierarchy.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.420]   They spend more time making eye contact.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.760]   They pay more attention to the other individual,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.120]   and we've shown that--
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.960]   - It's Burning Man.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.800]   - Yeah, it's true.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.640]   - I've never been to Burning Man.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.920]   - I've never either, but it's--
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.800]   - This is what I hear.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.520]   - No, I think that's the right point,
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.080]   and I'll circle back to that,
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.400]   because we also showed that in a task-based situation
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.520]   where a monkey can choose, we gave monkeys choices
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.280]   of whether they could give a reward to themselves,
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.880]   to another monkey, to a bottle that could collect reward,
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.520]   you know, in case they just like to see juice dripping out,
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.460]   and they would become more pro-social,
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.420]   so they're much more likely to give a reward
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.260]   to another monkey.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.260]   They're more altruistic, as we talked about earlier,
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.200]   so that's like, it looks like a real pro-social
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.740]   kind of thing, right, which I think is super interesting.
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.340]   In females, it's a little bit different.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.500]   Females become kind of nicer to each other,
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.620]   and we see that greater eye contact, et cetera,
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.820]   but they become more aggressive toward males.
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.420]   And we speculate, I think, it's a hypothesis,
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.140]   that because oxytocin is released
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.800]   when you've got an infant, basically, for females,
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.160]   males are a bigger threat then,
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.920]   because in many primate societies and other mammals,
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.940]   males sometimes can be infanticidal,
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.020]   because if they kill off a female's infant,
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.020]   then that will bring that female into receptivity
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.300]   for mating much more quickly,
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.980]   and so that's sort of the--
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.140]   - Brutal. - Evolutionary, yeah,
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.740]   it is brutal, the evolutionary rationale behind that.
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.240]   So that's kind of our supposition.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.700]   The other thing that I thought is really interesting,
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.380]   as well, is we find a greater,
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.880]   or an increase in the synchronization of behavior.
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.220]   So when I do, you know this idea of mirroring,
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.420]   which has been talked about in business context
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.580]   for a long time, it's a real thing,
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.300]   and it's a marker of a good relationship,
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.300]   a strong relationship.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.620]   If you have good rapport with somebody,
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.780]   you tend to adopt similar movements and postures,
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.540]   and if you do those things-- - Shirts.
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.100]   - Shirts, exactly, we didn't coordinate here, but yeah.
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.340]   - You just happen to be a great dresser.
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.060]   - Ah, well, you know, same here.
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.240]   So when you have that, actually, if you do those things,
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.260]   if I subtly mirror you, and I'm in a job interview,
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.380]   I'm more likely to get the job,
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.900]   gonna get a higher salary, et cetera,
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.420]   all those sort of good things. - Really?
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.380]   - So oxytocin turns up behavioral synchrony,
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.260]   and one of the things, this is like something
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.540]   I've been fascinated in for the last decade,
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.300]   and we and a lot of other people have been working on,
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.940]   is that this synchrony, the behavioral and neural level,
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.880]   physiological synchrony, is kind of,
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.380]   it's this black magic of social behavior.
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.900]   It's the glue that allows us to live and work together.
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.700]   So the observation is that if you and I,
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.140]   we have a good rapport here, let's say,
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.860]   if we are measuring activity in our brains right now,
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.180]   we'd see that they were coming into alignment.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.780]   So they might've been very disparate
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.740]   when I arrived here and you arrived here today,
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.020]   and as we've grown closer and we've discovered things
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.300]   that are similar about us, that the, you know,
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.740]   our mindsets and our emotional sets are more overlapping.
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.580]   So we see this world more similarly,
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.660]   we feel more similarly about it,
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.420]   we're more likely to take similar decisions,
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.660]   and then that, the coolest thing
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.340]   is this reverberates down to your body.
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.260]   So if our brains begin to align,
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.700]   our hearts actually begin to beat together,
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.300]   you know, if we have different resting heart rates,
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.380]   we begin to breathe together and you start to move together,
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.940]   you start to look at the same things in the environment.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.780]   We've talked about attention.
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.820]   When you look at something, the same thing,
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.140]   you're getting the same data and that feedback loop,
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.940]   which I think now you can see that
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.580]   that is a way to coordinate behavior.
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.420]   And that is the essence of sort of,
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.500]   that's our secret sauce as a species,
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.340]   which is that we can collaborate and do things together.
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.940]   And it seems to, like oxytocin, vasopressin
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.820]   are involved in this as a way
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.700]   of kind of turning up the dial on synchrony.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.140]   It seemed to turn up the so-called social brain network.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.380]   And then that synchrony is the glue,
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.580]   and it's a biomarker, a biological marker
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.020]   of a close relationship that predicts
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.220]   better communication, increased trust,
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.700]   better teamwork, you know,
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.220]   whether your marriage is gonna last.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.500]   I mean, the things that it predicts,
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.340]   you know, group decision-making,
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.900]   so we showed that in like in a business context,
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.980]   committees that are more in sync with each other,
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.340]   that their hearts are beating together,
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.220]   are more likely to reach the right decision
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.220]   in a really difficult problem
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.820]   than committees that are not.
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.420]   The cool thing is that now that you have a biomarker,
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.260]   you can hack that, right, in the sense that
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.780]   now we can start looking at all those
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.980]   trust-building exercises or anything else
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.620]   that, you know, is supposed to turn things up,
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.180]   turn up the dial on teamwork or communication,
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.300]   and we have a readout.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.940]   And we could say, yeah, that's working.
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.820]   That's actually doing the thing.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.180]   It's not BS, right?
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.700]   You should invest your time and energy in that
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.180]   rather than something else.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.380]   And there's like, now we've been working through this list
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.220]   as well as others.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.780]   There's a whole host of things
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.220]   that seem to actually turn up synchrony,
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.620]   and that's a shortcut to team chemistry.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.200]   you
