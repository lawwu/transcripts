[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   Two of the major driving themes in your ministry, Pastor John, are of course God's sovereignty
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.560]   and the centrality of joy in God.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.760]   And in the last podcast that was broadcast on Friday, episode 207, we talked about the
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.660]   joy of Calvinism and God's joy as the foundation of our own joy.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.660]   You have a second half explanation here of how Christian hedonism and Calvinism connect.
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.160]   Explain that for us now.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.000]   Tony, last time when you posed this question to me about sovereignty of God and joy, I
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.700]   said that God's joy in the fellowship of the Trinity is the foundation of His sovereignty
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.140]   and the overflow of His sovereignty as God creates the world to share in the joy that
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.460]   He has in Him.
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:59.080]   So now the question becomes more specifically, in this world there is so much sorrow.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.780]   We are disappointed again and again.
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.240]   We're discouraged, we suffer, we fail, we're assaulted, we get sick, we die.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.540]   Day after day, it seems to me, I mean, I feel that the world is attacking our joy in God,
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.540]   our family's joy in God, our church's joy in God, our nation's joy.
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.960]   We're constantly being assailed by things that threaten our joy.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.960]   And the question is, how does God's sovereignty work to help us fight for joy in God?
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.720]   Because joy in God is the reason we're made, and it's what glorifies God.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:48.380]   And the answer comes in Romans 8.28 and 8.32 and Genesis 50 verse 20.
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:56.900]   When I read, "Rejoice always," in 1 Thessalonians 5.16, I say to God, "Oh God, do you mean always?
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.020]   Really?"
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.080]   And I think His answer is, "Yes, but not a superficial smiley face.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.280]   Praise God anyhow, but rather with a 2 Corinthians 6.10 kind of answer, sorrowful yet always
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.580]   rejoicing."
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:23.000]   That there is a joy in God that is constant, even in the midst of sorrow, in loss.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.920]   And the reason that can be is because God in Christ has committed Himself to work everything
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.880]   together for our good, Romans 8.28.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.960]   And Romans 8.32 shows that Christ, in His dying for us and rising, is the ground of
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.960]   Romans 8.28.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.560]   "He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all, will He not with Him give
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.600]   us all things that He's..."
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.520]   Won't He work everything together for our good?
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.800]   So because Christ came and identified with us, bore our suffering, bore our sin, rose
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.920]   from the dead, triumphant, took away our guilt, purchased for us all the promises of God,
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.940]   therefore God is no longer angry at us, but His sovereignty serves entirely His mercy
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.000]   toward us, and thus He is working all of our calamities and all of our good times together
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.080]   for our good.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:29.640]   So that written over all the experiences of our life is Genesis 50, verse 20.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.720]   "They meant it for evil, the devil meant it for evil, my enemies meant it for evil, but
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.440]   God meant it for good."
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.440]   And I underline that word "meant it."
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.200]   God meant it for good.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.200]   So this meaning of God, this intention of God, this purpose of God in all of our hardships
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.000]   is the unshakable foundation for my joy.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.480]   So if somebody were to ask me, "How does God's sovereignty right now, in the midst of your
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.720]   loss of your mom or your loss of your granddaughter or this crisis in your church or this cancer
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.380]   that you had to walk through a few years ago, in that very moment, how does the sovereignty
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.680]   of God help?"
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.960]   I would say, "God means this."
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.960]   Not just uses.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.100]   Lots of people say God's playing catch-up ball all the time.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.260]   Like he finds things he didn't know were going to happen, he says, "Oh, well I can make something
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.260]   of that."
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.260]   No, no, no, no.
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.260]   That's not what the Bible says.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.180]   God meant it for good.
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.100]   So this cancer is coming from him.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.740]   This loss is coming from him.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.420]   This pain is coming from him.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.660]   And he means it, he intends it, he purposes it for my good.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.100]   And I know it's for my good because Christ bought it and he says that everything's going
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.620]   to work together for my good.
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.620]   And I was thinking about this, Tony, I just thought my mind situation here, now I'm 67,
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.220]   and this is what came to my mind.
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:05:01.020]   The older I get, the more thankful I become for God's sovereign keeping power.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.180]   Jude 1:24, a lot of people don't see this when they read it.
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.900]   It says, "Now to him who is able."
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.740]   Now that word "able," dunitas, means powerful.
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.300]   You could say sovereignly powerful, sovereignly able.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:23.460]   God is sovereignly committed and able to keep John Piper from stumbling and to present him
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.300]   blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.300]   So if you ask me then, "How does the sovereignty of God relate to my joy?"
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:40.140]   That verse says, "God's sovereign power and pledge to keep me from making shipwreck of
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:47.940]   my faith is intended to lead me now and in the end to great joy."
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:55.500]   And my love for my enemy or people I just have a hard time with flows out of this joy.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.020]   Loving people and worshiping God.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.180]   Romans 12, "Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, don't return evil for evil, don't
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.300]   avenge yourselves."
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.100]   Why?
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.820]   Because you can hand it over to God.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.820]   Why?
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.820]   Because vengeance is mine.
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.340]   I will repay, says the Lord.
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.300]   In other words, God's sovereignty has such a control over this world that if I think
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.500]   my enemy is getting the upper hand and that's intending to make me angry or bitter or vengeful,
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   I must remember, "No, no, no, no.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.860]   God is sovereign.
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.820]   Nobody gets away with anything.
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:34.340]   All accounts will be settled either on the cross if they repent or in hell if they don't."
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.940]   And so you can love them.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.360]   You can love your enemy.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.460]   You can feed him.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.700]   If your enemy's hungry, feed him.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.500]   If he's thirsty, give him something to drink.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.180]   You'll heat burning coals on his head.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.780]   Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:54.180]   So the sovereignty of God maintains my joy, not just for me, Tony, but for my enemy and
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.460]   for the world and for my ministry in the world to keep on going when it looks like the world
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.900]   is just spinning out of control in sin and corruption.
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.020]   It's not.
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.660]   God is sovereign.
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.100]   All accounts will be settled and that enables me then just to keep on loving.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.100]   Yes.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.360]   Thank you, Pastor John.
