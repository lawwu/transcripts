In the wake of 9/11, the US government has granted itself far-reaching new powers to spy on you, from email to bank statements to video cameras. After much debate, we resolved to turn the tables on three of our esteemed public officials. We embarked on an unauthorized sightseeing tour of their garbage, to make a point about how invasive a "garbage pool" really is, and to highlight the government's ongoing erosion of people's privacy.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.140]   We chose district attorney Mike Schronk because his office is the most vocal defender of the proposition that your garbage is up for grabs. We chose police chief Mark Croker because he runs the bureau. And we chose Mayor Vera Katz because, as police commissioner, she gives the chief his marching orders. Each in his or her own way has endorsed the notion that you abandon your privacy when you set your trash out on the curb. So we figured, "Let's do it."

But if three moral, upstanding, public-spirited citizens were each chewing their nails about the secrets we might have stumbled on, how the hell should the rest of us be feeling? Decked out in watch caps and rubber gloves, we are kneeling in a freezing garage and cradling our first major discovery, a five-pounder,
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.140]   We set it down next to the rest of our hall from district attorney Mike Schronk's trash, the remains of Thanksgiving turkey, the mounting stack of his granddaughter's diapers, the bag of dryer lint, the tub of skippy peanut butter, and the shredded bag of peanut M&Ms. There is something about poking through someone else's garbage that makes you feel dirty, and it's not just the stench and the slides. Scrap by scrap, we are reverse-engineering a grimy portrait of another human being, reconstituting an identity from his digital world.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:33.120]  , and the last thing we can do is to get down on your hands and knees and nose through wads of someone else's Kleenex. Is this why our parents sent us to college, so we could paw through orange peels and ice cream tubs and half-eaten loaves of bread? And yet, there is also something seductive, almost intoxicating about being a dumpster detective. For example, we spot a clothing tag,
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:51.180]  , and we find a bag of

Then we find the other half, which reads Men's SU 3 button, stringing it together and we deduce that Schronk plunked down $262.99 for a size 44 3 button suit at Meyer and Frank on Saturday November 16 at 9:35 a.

[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:26.400]   До a microtrack. I don't have a microtrack. I'm going to buy a micro cut shredder. There are three kinds of strip shredder, which is the cheapest crosscut shredder, which are increasingly prominent, or the micro cut shredder, which is the very smallest, go ahead and buy a micro cut shredder. So you get the smallest shredding pieces. The second thing to do is to make sure that you're not only shredding important documents, because there is a large amount of shredded materials and just a few important financial statements mixed in or some important tax returns mixed in.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:55.320]  . With the junk mail, the political advertisements, the magazines, etc. Now, it would be very difficult for someone to take all the time to put that together. And then the third thing that you want to do with your shredder is you want to disseminate the papers and don't keep them conveniently together in one bag. Whether that means you just dump them into your garbage can, whether that means you separate those shreds into two different weeks of garbage, then whatever it is, however you approach that, just make sure they're not easily collectible by somebody who's going after that shredded paper.
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:36:24.320]   My wife laughs at me, but I think it's worth doing this to go ahead, shred the magazines, newspapers, the junk mail, etc. Of course, you might make an exception with things like newspapers, but if you ever are dealing with a newspaper, like you cut things out, etc. That gives off a lot of information about you. So consider shredding all of those things. Make sure that you don't miss all of the little things in your garbage. For example, if you have prescription bottles of medication, then pull the information off of that and pull the label off and put it in your garbage can.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:31.580]   think

[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:37.540]   I,
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:38.040]   of years ago,
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.640]   I went through a large amount of paper.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.580]   I can't remember for a family member.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.460]   I was sorting through it and I was disposing of,
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.220]   of financial documents and it was just so much to shred.
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.440]   I didn't want to feed it into a household shredder,
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.620]   10 sheets at a time.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:49.880]   So I thought,
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.060]   Oh,
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:50.580]   I'll burn it.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.020]   Burning paper is not easy,
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:52.820]   especially in the burning,
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:53.180]   large,
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:38:23.200]  ,
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:23.200]   and large amounts of paper is not easy.
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:23.820]   Bleach out.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.200]   But if you need to,
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.240]   let's say you have a large number of financial papers,
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.000]   you're going through your deceased parents,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.220]   financial documents,
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:31.940]   things like that.
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.600]   And it's just too much to consider shredding all that stuff.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.480]   If you put them,
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.080]   take a garbage can,
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:38.640]   put a big,
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.300]   heavy yard waste bag in it,
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.660]   put a jug of,
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.200]   of bleach and water,
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.300]   enough water in it to cover and then stir it up.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.820]   What will happen is the paper will become waterlogged and the bleach and the,
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.220]   and the water together will blur the ink and the paper will become
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:53.220]   waterlogged.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:53.220]   And then you can put a big heavy yard waste bag in it and then you
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:53.220]   put a jug of bleach and water and then stir it up.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:39:23.240]   complicates it.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:23.240]   and somewhat dissolve the paper.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:23.240]   You can turn it into kind of a flurry and then you can throw that whole bag out being increasingly confident that most of that information has been destroyed. So with paper, paper is relatively easy to deal with and of course paper is the most important thing for most of us to pay attention to. Yes it may say something about your personal tastes in terms of the ice cream cartons that are in your garbage. But paper of course has the most dangerous information. So if you're a person who wants to use a garbage can,
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:23.240]   It's not a good idea to throw it away.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:23.240]   It's not a good idea to throw it away.

[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   In Wisconsin, some municipal governments are taking garbage surveillance to a whole new level. In Onalaska and La Crosse, garbage trucks are actually equipped with video cameras. Garbage trucks scan the chips installed in each bin when emptying carts. The cameras monitor the materials being dumped and transmit a detailed collection history back to the company in order to determine if the right materials are coming out of each container. This information is, when deemed necessary, used to levy fines against residents who improperly sort their waste.
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:57.940]   This kind of automated garbage monitoring raises very serious privacy concerns. While encouraging residents to recycle is commendable, any program involving the government's systematic monitoring of citizens crosses a line. The contents of your trash can be surprisingly revealing.
