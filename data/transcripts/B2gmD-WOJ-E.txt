[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.800]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.320]   This is another special episode related to current events.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.280]   We don't plan to dedicate a lot of episodes
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.680]   to the coronavirus pandemic,
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.400]   but we will today speaking directly to youth.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.760]   Pastor John is with me today from his home office.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.920]   And Pastor John, as you know, just a few weeks back,
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.640]   I spoke to a youth group in Frisco, Texas,
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.720]   about 100 or so students packed together
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.040]   in a little room in the church
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.520]   to talk about smartphones and social media habits.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.880]   It was a great time.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.440]   But I started off by asking how many of them knew
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.920]   what Ask Pastor John was.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.800]   And I think every single hand went up in the room.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.400]   It was shocking to me, I wasn't expecting it.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400]   So I think a lot of youth listen to this podcast already.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.040]   I suspect that's because their parents listen to episodes
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.320]   and car rides around town.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.520]   For whatever reason, they know about this podcast.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.620]   So let's take this moment to speak directly to those youth.
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.260]   You have 14 grandkids now.
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.640]   That's incredible.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.160]   Become Grandfather John for a moment.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.760]   What would you say to the youth in this season
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.000]   about God and coronavirus?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.680]   - That's good, I didn't know you were gonna say that.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.360]   But I had thought, I'm 74 years old.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.560]   That means I'm old enough to be your granddad,
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.380]   and maybe your great granddad.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.680]   My name is John Piper.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.360]   You can call me Pastor John.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.360]   I want to talk to you for a few minutes
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.560]   about the coronavirus,
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.400]   that sickness that is changing
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.040]   how people live all over the world.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.520]   And I want to talk about God,
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.520]   I want to talk about Jesus, and about you.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.280]   What does the coronavirus have to do
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.640]   with you and God and Jesus?
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.760]   So I hope you'll listen for just a few minutes.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.760]   What makes the coronavirus so unusual and so dangerous
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.440]   is that you can catch it as a sickness
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.240]   by just being around people who have it,
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.080]   and you can't tell when they have it.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.200]   And that makes it really dangerous,
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.640]   which is why everybody is staying inside these days,
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.560]   trying to stop the virus.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.560]   And because it is 10 times more serious
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.600]   than the ordinary flu.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.240]   And the reason our leaders,
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.200]   like the governor and the president of the United States,
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   are so concerned is because maybe one or two
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.280]   or three people out of every hundred
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.080]   who get this sickness will die from it.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.280]   Now that may not sound like a lot,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.800]   like one or two out of every hundred,
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.360]   but if in my town, for example, Minneapolis,
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.920]   100,000 people, which is not unlikely,
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.080]   100,000 people got sick with this,
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   that means 1,000 or 2,000, maybe 3,000,
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.760]   are going to die of it.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.400]   So when you think of it that way,
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.860]   that's a lot of people who weren't planning to die
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.720]   that quick are now gonna die if it spreads that much.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.440]   Now the Bible teaches, and the Bible is God's very word,
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.400]   the Bible teaches that God is stronger
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.280]   than the coronavirus.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.880]   I hope you believe that.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.880]   We know this because Matthew 4, verse 24 says,
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.880]   they brought Jesus all the sick,
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.440]   those afflicted with various diseases and pains,
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.720]   and he healed them.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.720]   So Jesus is more powerful than diseases, every one of them.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.260]   In fact, over and over again,
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.260]   the Bible tells us that God commands the wind, rain, snow,
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.560]   lightning, plants, grass, grasshoppers,
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.780]   flies, frogs, gnats, worms, whales, birds, everything else.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.440]   He commands them where to go, what to do,
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.900]   and they do what he says.
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.400]   They have to, he's God.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.760]   They do what he says.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.740]   God made the whole world and everything in it,
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.680]   and he holds the world in his hand,
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.540]   and he does what he wants to do with the world
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.320]   and in the world, and you can see that again
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.260]   in Paul's letter to the Ephesians in chapter one, verse 11,
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.940]   where he says, "God works all things."
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.820]   That includes the coronavirus.
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.820]   "God works all things according to the counsel of his will."
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.980]   That means nobody is over God, telling God what to do.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.120]   He's the highest.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.460]   He's the strongest decision-maker in the world.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.680]   Nobody makes God do what he doesn't choose to do.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.680]   He made the world.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.680]   He holds it up, so he does what he wants with it and in it.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.380]   It never falls apart.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.840]   It always does what he plans for it to do all the time
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.080]   and all of it.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.000]   So, I hope you're asking, and it's right to ask
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.960]   if we ask humbly, ready to learn the answer from God,
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.960]   why is there a coronavirus?
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.960]   Why don't you, God, Jesus, please, take it away
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.720]   since you could, and that's right, he could.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.960]   He's God.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.400]   The coronavirus is not God.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.840]   The coronavirus is not stronger than Jesus.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.880]   Jesus could take it away just by snapping his finger,
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.840]   and the time will come when he has decided
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.400]   he will take it away, and it might happen overnight.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.560]   We don't know how it will happen.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.960]   So, why is it here?
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.960]   Why doesn't he just take it away now?
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.960]   And the answer's this, because he has wise purposes for it.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.740]   God is perfectly wise.
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.500]   That means he knows exactly what needs to be done
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.760]   to bring about what's best for all time.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.760]   That's called wisdom.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.600]   When you know what's best to do all the time,
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.540]   you're a wise person, and God is perfect in wisdom.
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.320]   He knows what needs to be done.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.120]   He knows how it needs to be done.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.000]   He knows when it needs to be done,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.080]   and since God is perfectly wise and knows everything,
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.760]   he knows way, way, way, way more than we know.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.540]   Everything he makes happen and everything he lets happen
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.540]   fits into a perfectly wise and good plan that he has.
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:51.020]   We can't see all of it, all the plan,
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.720]   but we can see some of it.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.560]   For example, let me give you some things that I can see
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.540]   and you can see in the Bible
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.540]   that God is planning to do with the coronavirus.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.320]   Number one, Jesus said in Luke 13
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.480]   that things like the coronavirus happen
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.080]   so that people in the world who don't believe in Jesus
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.080]   would wake up and repent and think about God and Jesus
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.800]   and heaven and hell and salvation
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.460]   and the need for forgiveness
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.920]   and that they would turn to Jesus and be saved.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.660]   That's one thing he's doing.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.660]   Number two, Paul said that things like the coronavirus
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.120]   happen so that people would stop trusting in themselves
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.320]   and trust God, 2 Corinthians 1.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.520]   Lots of people think, adults think, children think,
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.600]   that they're way smarter than they are,
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.240]   way stronger than they are, way more in control.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.120]   The captain of my soul.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.840]   There's a movie about that, I'm the captain of my soul.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.600]   Baloney, you're not the captain of your soul.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.760]   God is the captain of your soul,
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.760]   and that kind of pride needs to be brought down.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.900]   If it needs to be brought down by coronavirus,
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.760]   God will do it.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.560]   We have a lot of arrogant leaders in this world
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.160]   who need to be humbled,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.520]   and if it takes the coronavirus to do it, God will do it.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.160]   God wants us to know that he's in control
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.520]   and that we ought to trust him
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.980]   and not our own abilities or our own intelligence.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.680]   That's number two.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.400]   And the third thing that God is doing is this.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.400]   The Bible says that things like the coronavirus happen
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.400]   to show us that we might be loving things
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.920]   more than we love God.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.380]   We might be loving other people more than we love God.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.840]   And there's nothing in the world more important
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.940]   than loving Jesus more than we love ourselves
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.120]   or more than we love other people.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.120]   So the coronavirus is showing people what they love most.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.160]   So God is in charge of the coronavirus,
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.820]   and he knows what he's doing,
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.640]   and he's perfectly good and perfectly wise.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.780]   And here's the really good news
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.120]   we ought to want the whole world to hear.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.380]   So I hope you will share with your friends,
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.380]   namely the news that Jesus, God's only son,
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.600]   came into the world and died
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.600]   so that God would never punish us if we trust him.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:33.160]   He said that the punishment that you and I deserve
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.920]   because of our sin, that punishment was put on Jesus.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:45.360]   And if we trust Jesus, that is if we receive Jesus,
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.920]   welcome Jesus as our savior and our guide
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.560]   and our treasure, the one we really love,
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.280]   then we never have to be afraid of God.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.780]   We never have to be afraid of God's punishment ever.
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.720]   This is wonderful.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.520]   That means we don't ever have to be afraid to die,
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.140]   not from the coronavirus or anything else,
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:15.000]   because when Jesus died and rose from the dead,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   he changed death from punishment into doorway
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   to everlasting happiness with him.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.980]   So what does it mean?
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.360]   You don't have to be afraid of the coronavirus.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.640]   God is stronger than the coronavirus.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.480]   And if you trust his son, Jesus,
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.400]   God will make everything turn out for your good.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.680]   So be brave.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.680]   Don't be brave because you're strong.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.280]   That's called pride.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.920]   All those TV superheroes, they're all proud.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.680]   They're not basing their strength on God.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.520]   They're just basing it on stuff
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.520]   that they have inside of them.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.820]   Don't be like them because you're not them
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.040]   and you're not strong, you're weak.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.880]   Be brave because you have a great savior, your best friend,
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.400]   Jesus, your savior and Lord is strong,
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.240]   strong enough to make everything,
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:14.080]   including the coronavirus, turn out for your good.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.400]   I taught the kids in our church when I was a pastor,
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.100]   a two-line poem.
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.320]   It's especially for children who believe in Jesus.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.880]   Hundreds of them said it over the years.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.440]   Let me teach it to you and we'll be done.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.880]   And I'm gonna say it once
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.840]   and then you say it with me the second time, okay?
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.120]   Goes like this.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.960]   When things don't go the way they should,
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.880]   God always makes them turn for good.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.920]   Okay, now you say it with me.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.740]   When things don't go the way they should,
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.520]   God always makes them turn for good.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.740]   You know, I bet if we say it one more time,
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.220]   you won't forget it 'cause you're kids,
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.520]   you remember everything.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.360]   Let's do it.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.080]   When things don't go the way they should,
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.120]   God always makes them turn for good.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.360]   Maybe kids, we'll talk again later.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.200]   I don't know.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.480]   But for now, trust Jesus no matter what.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.280]   You'll never be sorry.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.160]   - No, you'll never be sorry.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.840]   That's a great word, Pastor John.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.240]   As Pastor John just mentioned here,
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.640]   in passing, we have an amazing opportunity
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.780]   to share the gospel with our classmates
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.920]   and with our friends in this season.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.960]   And if you have access to social media
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.120]   or texting or phone calling or video messaging,
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.120]   or maybe you can even meet face-to-face,
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.400]   we would encourage you to reach out to your friends
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.580]   with the hope of Jesus.
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.480]   This is the time.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.880]   The time is right. - Yeah, amen.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.240]   - And as you do, may the Lord give you boldness
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.200]   and the right words to speak eternal truth
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.640]   into the lives of your friends during this season.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.680]   Well, here at DG, once a week or so,
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.460]   we're producing special resources related to this pandemic,
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.840]   including this episode and other APJ episodes and articles.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.020]   You can find all of those resources online
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.520]   at desiringgod.org/coronavirus.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.920]   That's desiringgod.org/coronavirus.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.840]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.120]   Thanks for listening to the podcast,
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.000]   and we will see you next time.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:29.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
