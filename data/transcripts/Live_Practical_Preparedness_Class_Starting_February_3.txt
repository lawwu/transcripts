[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.120]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.680]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.440]   Next week, I am starting a live webinar series, and I want to tell you a little bit about
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.000]   what I'm going to do and invite you to join me for that series. But before I do, I want
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.280]   to begin with a story. About an hour ago, I received this email from a listener. The
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.080]   writer writes in and says, "Hey Joshua, just wanted to say thank you for all you've published
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.800]   in preparedness over the last years. It got me interested in taking care of my family
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.640]   and having a plan for emergency situations. That has come in handy since, in the last
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.160]   week, the city I live in has had confirmed cases of the coronavirus and has shut down
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.540]   the roads into the city, greatly disrupting food supplies. Further, they've recommended
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.040]   everyone stay indoors for two weeks. Thanks to you, I have stored up 40 liters of bottled
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.920]   water, two independent water filtration systems, 100 pounds of rice, 30 pounds of flour, 15
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.240]   pounds of sugar, 5 pounds of salt, 30 liters of oil, a bunch of canned foods, peanut butter,
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.720]   jelly, etc. I actually had just started prepping. A goal this year is to build up a three-month
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.640]   supply, so those reserves are insufficient in a variety of ways I need to fix. But I'm
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.360]   thankful that, due to your teaching, I had already started prepping, and so now, in a
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.720]   very unexpected situation, I have no worries whatsoever that my family will be fine, even
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.560]   if the two-week suggested self-isolation turns into a month-long quarantine. So, thank you.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.640]   You might have literally saved my family's life. Thanks again.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.600]   Well, I don't know if I've saved your family's life, but certainly it is possible. I guess
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.520]   I would just say that you've... It is possible that you've saved your family's life, and
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.160]   I hope that I've just been an inspiration to that. But I thought this email was, of
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.200]   course, deeply encouraging to me and so timely, because this is the kind of thing that I take
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.300]   great satisfaction... This is the kind of change that I take great satisfaction of having
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:36.360]   been able to catalyze, to help people just think ahead and recognize that, if I do this
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.520]   action, if I take this action, then I can have a certain result. And it's so superior
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.080]   to be in a situation like that versus constantly being behind and constantly being stuck with
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.240]   everything that you're doing.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.160]   Now, about saving somebody's life. Would this listener and his family have starved if they
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.840]   had to stay in their apartment for two weeks? Nah, of course not. You're not going to starve
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.920]   for two weeks. It's probably good for you to have an extended fast. But you might be
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.040]   pretty miserable. And depending on your personal situation, there might be varying levels of
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.080]   misery. If you're a single man in a little apartment and you've got a good supply of
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.960]   books laid in, or you've got an internet connection, you've got important work to do, and you just
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.240]   can't eat for two weeks, your stomach will growl. But after about the third day, the
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.080]   hunger pains go away and you don't have to worry so much about that. You're basically
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.320]   just going to be bored with not being able to eat. And you can focus on your work. But
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.720]   I've got four small children. If I'm locked in a little apartment in Asia with my four
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.920]   little children and we can't go out, we just got one little balcony that we can go out
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.040]   and look out and maybe speak encouraging things to our neighbors across the way, we're going
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.360]   to go a little crazy. First, of course, there's the natural cabin fever. But if I didn't have
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.680]   food for my children, they're going to get hungry and children don't process hunger the
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.720]   same way that adults do. It's pretty devastating. One of the most devastating positions you
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.620]   can be in as a parent is to have hungry children who are whining and complaining simply because
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.320]   they don't really know how to do anything else. They're hungry, their bodies hurt, and
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.800]   not be able to do that. It's devastating. I mean, my compassion levels of people who
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.000]   are starving increased so massively once I became a parent and started to experience
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.200]   it. It's one of the worst feelings in the world to not be able to provide for your children.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.800]   Similarly, if I don't have entertainment and I've got four small children running around
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.160]   just acting like crazy hooligans, I mean, whether we're alive or not, I'm sure my wife
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.000]   and I are going to at least consider strangling one or two of them to appease the others,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.040]   but it'd be crazy to be in that situation and not be prepared. And so a lot of times
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.120]   the difference between surviving barely and really thriving during an emergency is prior
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.240]   preparation. Human beings are pretty stinking resilient. They really know how to survive
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:04.080]   a lot of things. A lot of things that are often just simply ignored by others. People
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.680]   die. People are going to die today. Fathers of families are going to die today. And when
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.080]   they die today, they're going to die without any life insurance. And as they die without
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.180]   life insurance, they're going to be in a situation, people figure it out when they have to. Today,
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.020]   people are going to get disabled, never be able to work again the rest of their life.
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.400]   They and their families will figure it out. They'll figure it out. Because when you have
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.320]   to figure things out, you wind up figuring them out no matter what. People are resilient.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.960]   They know what they have to do. Difficult circumstances and trials have a way sometimes
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.600]   of bringing out the best in people. And you're a smart person. You're listening to a financial
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.680]   podcast. You would probably survive in that situation. It might not be uncomfortable,
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.280]   but you would probably survive. Now there is, however, the interesting other way of
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.800]   looking at it though, because what often happens is when people are in a situation, they make
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.660]   one small thing that could have been avoided, but often leads to death. So in this situation,
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.440]   if you're prepared and you know that I don't have to rush out and buy supplies the last
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.640]   moment, you can minimize your contact with other people who might be contagious. That
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.460]   could be the thing that keeps you from getting sick. You don't know. And how could you ever
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.540]   prove that? But if a lot of people around you are contagious and you're going out, rushing
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.400]   out trying to figure out how to buy supplies the last minute, that could be the thing that
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.800]   causes you to become sick. And maybe you then sicken the rest of your family and somebody
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.640]   in your family winds up dying because of it. Well, if you can just simply stay at home
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.200]   and avoid that circumstance entirely, you have a much better probability for survival
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.800]   because you're minimizing your contact with other people. Similarly, you might avoid problems
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.760]   such as a riot or other things. Just simply avoiding those situations that often wind
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.180]   up being dangerous is one of the best ways to increase your survivability in life. So
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.080]   you don't know, but if you have the ability to stay at home and relax and not rush out
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.120]   last minute to try to go get supplies, you may minimize the risk of you and your family
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.400]   becoming sick, which could actually save your life. That's one of the reasons why it's so
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.680]   important to prepare. So prepare in advance for anything. Prepare in advance so that you
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:25.360]   can have a very different experience of a catastrophe. Catastrophes are hard enough
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.960]   when you're prepared, but when you are unprepared, they become that much harder. And if you care
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.960]   about yourself, you care about your family, you don't want to see them go through any
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:40.920]   greater difficulty than is absolutely necessary. And it certainly is not fun to know, "I could
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.320]   have done something else, but I didn't." That's a really bad feeling. Regret? Regret stinks.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.880]   If you've done all you can and the situation is more than you can handle, fine. You did
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.240]   all you can and you just figure it out when you're in the middle of it. But if you know
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.560]   that you ignored, you were ignorant, you were ignorant, you ignored the things that you
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:07.160]   could do just because you were lazy or some other reason, that's a hard situation to be
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.480]   in. So I want to tell you a little bit more now about what I'm doing. When I recorded
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.720]   yesterday's show, I didn't have a lot of details because I just decided to do it the day before.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.920]   I just topped up a quick registration page and had many of you already sign up for that.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.440]   So thank you. More details coming out right now. So number one, what am I doing? I'm recording
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:29.840]   a live webinar series on how to prepare for disasters. Practical preparedness, practical
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.040]   prepping. As far as the exact scope of that, I'm not sure. I'm guessing it's going to be
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.160]   four to five webinars based upon the outline, the amount of things that I could talk about.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.360]   I think that's appropriate. But I'll be recording it and producing it as a live webinar series.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.160]   I'll also be doing it and using your input as a way of shaping that series, both with
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.600]   a number of surveys in advance of specifically the topics that you're most interested in
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:02.700]   and also even a live Q&A. The biggest challenge that I face as a digital teacher is greatly
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.120]   delayed feedback from a classroom. It's actually the same thing with public speaking. I've
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.640]   done a fair amount of public speaking in my life. Public speaking is challenging for a
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:18.160]   lot of people. But podcasting or creating videos or something like that is far more
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.920]   challenging than public speaking. Because in public speaking, you can read the response
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.280]   of your audience. What happens is as you become more confident and more skilled as a speaker,
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.920]   you'll attune yourself to the needs of your audience. If you speak too long about something
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.240]   or you're starting to speak in a boring way, you notice your audience drifting and you
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.280]   cut that short or you move on to the next thing and you respond or you interrupt the
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.160]   flow, you tell a joke or you tell a story or you do something that's going to re-engage
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.120]   the attention of your audience and you have that immediate feedback. So you can tell if
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:58.240]   you're speaking in a boring way. You can tell if something that you said was offensive or
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.920]   you've said something that was offensive and you can immediately clarify a point based
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.520]   upon the shocked look in your audience's eyes. Say, "No, no. What I meant was this." And
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:14.980]   you simply clarify your point. So in my experience, as difficult as public speaking can be, it's
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:20.320]   easier than doing something like podcasting. When you podcast, you give a speech but you
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.600]   don't get any immediate feedback. So you can listen to what you're saying through the ears
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:30.840]   of your imagined listener but you don't actually know how it's being received. You don't actually
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.800]   know when you're lingering too long on a point. You don't actually know when you've said something
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.920]   that was confusing. You don't actually know when you've said something that was boring
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.760]   because you don't know when people are tuning out. You don't actually know when you've said
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.320]   something offensive that you would like to clarify but you don't know until days later
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.720]   when all of a sudden you get a rash of emails and then you go ahead and clarify those points.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.800]   It's one thing that makes it extremely challenging.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.440]   Well, the same thing really comes in when it comes to teaching. And so I've recorded
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:04.000]   and released a number of courses. And I've done it both ways. I've recorded them live
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.080]   and then delivered them live and I've also recorded them pre-recorded and just simply
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.960]   delivered them in pre-recorded sessions and then followed it up with Q&A. And one of the
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.400]   big challenges is simply knowing, am I hitting the mark? Am I communicating things that are
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:23.580]   practical that are useful? Is it too much information? Is it too little information?
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.480]   And so I really like the format or the idea of the format of recording things in a live
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.840]   Q&A session. Sorry, a live webinar format. I haven't been able to do that over the last
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.600]   few years because I haven't been in a stable location with a stable internet signal, etc.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:43.040]   to be able to do that in the way that needs to be done. But I now have that. I have backups.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.360]   I keep two internet networks in my house. So the idea of having backup supplies and
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.880]   everything, I can't run the risk of my business being down. And so I have multiple internet
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.600]   networks. I guess a third backup would be if I count the idea of tethering to a phone.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.120]   So in theory, I've got three levels of backups. I've got an emergency generator in case I
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.560]   lose power. So I do everything I can to try to make sure that everything goes off without
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:17.080]   a hitch because it's important. So the point is, live webinar series will allow me to teach
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.880]   to a live audience and then to make sure that I'm answering the best questions. I love doing
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.720]   Q&A. Q&A shows are my favorite question and answer shows. They're my favorite shows to
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.240]   create because you can make sure that you're giving something really useful. So what am
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:36.520]   I going to give to you in this live webinar series? I'm going to give you a comprehensive,
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:44.080]   basically Joshua's comprehensive course on practical preparedness. How to be prepared
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:51.360]   in case the financial systems fall apart. I believe and I have repeatedly emphasized
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.760]   that frankly money is one of your best preparations. As long as everything is working simply in
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:02.060]   the economic systems, money is almost always your best preparation. And financial instruments
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:06.240]   are almost always your best preparation. But when something goes wacky in the markets,
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.640]   when all of a sudden there's a fear about a new flu virus and then the stores are emptied
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:18.540]   out of respirator masks and you can't find bleach on the shelves anywhere, which I would
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.280]   guess right now is probably going to be the case, if not already in many parts of the
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:28.280]   world. It depends on what happens with the virus in the coming days as information emerges.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:34.060]   Hopefully it's nothing and it was all a bunch of concern over nothing. But if it actually
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.760]   turns into something significant, you won't be able to find bleach, you won't be able
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.840]   to find nitrile gloves, you won't be able to find respirator masks, you won't be able
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.200]   to find any of that stuff because it's quickly taken up. And one of the biggest dangers in
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.840]   the modern world is supply chain management. With the just-in-time inventory system, which
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.740]   leads to very profitable companies and a really good system, for most situation it collapses
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:14:00.520]   during times of panic and times of hoarding where people rush out and buy everything.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.020]   And I think we all do it. I went to the store yesterday and I bought a bunch more masks.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:12.860]   Did I need them? Define need. Did I have some? Yeah. But if I can see that there are a couple
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.540]   dozen on the shelf there and I can just go ahead and buy them, and the worst case scenario
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.860]   is I've wasted $20, but the best case scenario is I've got masks for me and all my family
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:28.300]   members to wear that keeps us from being infected by a flu virus, that seems like a pretty decent
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:34.040]   use of $20. But what does that do? That wipes out things for the next guy. Next guy comes
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:40.100]   along and sees that all of a sudden all of the N95 masks are gone from the shelf and
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.500]   now he starts to worry. And so he goes to the next store over and says, "Oh, they have
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.100]   some." And so he grabs them. And the panic just builds and builds and builds. It's a
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:51.980]   contagion of sorts, a contagion of emotion, a contagion of panic that happens when all
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:57.780]   of a sudden you start making excessive purchases and the supply chain, the supply chains don't
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:03.060]   respond very well to that. They especially don't respond well if you're dealing with
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:11.300]   a very widespread scenario. So here's where a regional event is much safer. So let's use
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:16.340]   Florida and a hurricane. Hurricane starts coming towards Florida. It could be Carolinas,
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.420]   anywhere. Same thing happens all the time. Hurricane starts coming towards Florida. Everyone
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.680]   says, "I need to go out and get bottled water." And so people rush out and get bottled water.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.320]   And then the stores start to be emptied of bottled water. But quickly, the supply chain
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:34.880]   management systems, they start to react. And so Costco will put trucks that are entirely
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:40.320]   devoted to bottled water and they'll start shipping trucks in from Georgia, from Alabama,
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.080]   from Mississippi. And they'll send basically all the bottled water in the country to Florida.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:50.800]   And so the shortage is more and more only temporary. All the big stores, the big grocery
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.300]   stores in Texas and in Florida and in the Carolinas, et cetera, they know how to respond
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.880]   when there are hurricane warnings issued. They go into protocols and they've gotten
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.360]   much better over the last 10 years, just like cell phone systems have gotten much better
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.120]   over the last decade. I'm sure the same thing happens in the winter storm areas where they
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.440]   respond to the need and they can react to it. But the key thing is, where are those
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.200]   supplies coming from? Usually what they'll do is they'll divert the supplies from another
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.160]   state that's not being threatened. Well, one of the major dangers of something like a flu
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:24.840]   pandemic, why it can be so severe is it's probably not contained to a region. If you
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:31.200]   truly had a big scale pandemic, it can become quickly a national and international thing.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.720]   And so right now, people who are going out and buying up respirator masks, N95 and greater
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.640]   respirator masks right now, they're doing it regardless of location. And so Home Depots
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.360]   are being wiped out, Amazon being sold out. And there's not a place to quickly get the
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:52.080]   resupply from. It can come quickly from the factories or the warehouses if they are there,
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   but it can't be sent on a regional basis. And so if something like this coronavirus
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:05.160]   emerges even stronger, then it drives the panic and the resupply is not available. So
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:11.320]   all the materials, the gloves, the masks, the bleach, those kinds of things start to
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:17.280]   get wiped out. Very, very severe. Sorry, I shouldn't say very severe. Has the potential
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:23.320]   to be very, very severe if the sickness turns into something very, very significant. So
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.960]   of course, we don't know. I'm just using it as an example to say, think about this and
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:35.080]   prepare. So back to what I'll be teaching you. Practical preparedness is what works
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:39.920]   when the financial system breaks down. If you have money, you can go and buy the things
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.360]   that you need. But if the economic system is breaking down due to problems with supply
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.720]   and demand or due to problems with economic issues, then all of a sudden now that's where
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:56.000]   practical preparedness comes in. Doesn't matter how much money you have if there simply
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.600]   isn't bottled water or respirator masks available. And so the only way to be prepared for that
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:06.000]   is to in advance have stockpiles of those things so that you're not caught flat-footed
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.720]   during the time of the emergency. The only way to be prepared in advance is to have supplies
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.080]   of food and to have supplies of water and have supplies of a water filter and to have
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:20.040]   gasoline, etc. for your generator, things like that, so that when the supply chain itself
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.600]   gets disrupted, that you're not personally disrupted.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:30.120]   The next thing that I'll talk about in the series is, as I go through practical preparations,
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:37.240]   is I will adjust everything for impact. One of the most important things to consider when
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:43.600]   you're making decisions is what's going to impact my life the most? What's going to make
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:50.680]   the biggest difference? Because an 80/20 Pareto analysis can be applied to almost anything.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.680]   With food, with energy, with almost anything, where am I going to get the most bang for
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:04.720]   my buck? One of the real challenges with prepping is you have to think about it in terms of
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.880]   stages. Otherwise, you will go crazy. You have to think about it in terms of stages.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.720]   You could spend today, if you decided, "I want to be a well-prepared prepper," you could
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:20.920]   go out and you could spend $100,000 today and still not feel well-prepared if you give
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:27.480]   in to an extreme form of preparedness. I'm not exaggerating with that number. You could
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.560]   do it and still not feel well-prepared because you can come up with scenarios that are so
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:36.000]   extreme and you can just say, "Wow, everything would fall apart," and you can make buying
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.360]   lists and gear lists and skills lists and action lists that are so extensive that it's
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.760]   almost impossible to do them.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:50.440]   But realistically speaking, that's probably not necessary. Only a tiny percentage of people
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:55.560]   would ever go into some kind of extreme scenario like that. What you want to focus on is you
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:01.960]   want to focus on where am I going to get the most results? What 20% of actions or items
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:09.000]   or supplies are going to give me 80% of the results, the protection? Those things exist.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.480]   I want to teach you how to think about it first so that you can make good decisions.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:20.440]   In addition, you have to think about cost and you have to practically consider where
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:27.440]   am I going to get the most benefit for the money that I spend? You may have or intend
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.480]   to spend a lot of money in the fullness of time, but you still want to be thoughtful
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:38.160]   in how you approach it. I still like buying white flour and oil and sugar and salt and
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:44.440]   peanut butter and jelly because it's insanely cheap and yet gives you massive amounts of
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.640]   calories. It's easy to provide and it fits the needs. If you eat rice and beans, rice
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.440]   and beans. There's a reason why these are time-tested staples.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:58.280]   Now, you can also get a lot of bang for your buck with something like buying wheat and
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.440]   actual wheat itself, but then there's a whole other set of costs associated with it. For
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:07.400]   example, you have to have a wheat grinder. Well, a good wheat grinder is several hundred
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:13.600]   dollars. Really, that's a substantial commitment to your prepping versus a couple hundred dollars.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.200]   I'd rather if you're getting started, you go out and buy 30 pounds or 50 pounds or 100
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:23.920]   pounds of white flour and just throw it away in three or four or five years and do it again
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:29.640]   than buy a bunch of wheat and not take the step of buying a wheat grinder. Things like
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.680]   that exist all throughout preparedness. You've got to think carefully about the budget and
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.880]   you've got to do those things that are going to give you a lot of return for your dollars
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:43.520]   invested. In addition, you have to think about things like your practical situation. It's
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:50.080]   very different if you are a college student living in a college dorm versus if you are
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.960]   a very stable adult living out on a family farm. You've got a world of different things
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.320]   that you can do in either one of those situations, but there's a lot of stuff that a college
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:04.080]   student can do or an inner city dweller, somebody living in a small studio apartment in the
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.620]   middle of the city. There's a lot of things that you can do that really will pay off big
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:14.560]   time for you in your preparation if you plan and think in advance. You've got to adjust
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:20.600]   everything to the size of your scale. These are some of the areas where I have some real
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:25.840]   unique insight and some lessons to share with you because I've gone from living in a tiny
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:31.840]   studio apartment, figuring out how to be prepared there. I've gone on to owning a big house,
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.640]   then downsizing to an apartment, then downsizing to a bunch of suitcases and now I live in
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.400]   a large house again. When you're going through those kinds of changes, what happens is a
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.240]   lot of times people who are into preparedness get so fixated on stuff, they actually become
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:51.320]   a slave to their stuff. They got so much stuff they can't be nimble. Here's where I think
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:56.520]   I have some unique ideas to offer of how you can be nimble and get results that are pretty
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:03.320]   good and some preparedness, but without having to commit yourself to a 50-acre farm in the
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:09.000]   middle of nowhere. I'd love to have a 50-acre farm in the middle of nowhere with barns full
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.520]   of stuff. I probably would, but I'm not there and I'm not willing to go there at this point
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:19.920]   in my life. If I were convinced that World War III was going to kick off next week, would
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:27.680]   I do that? Maybe, but I'm not convinced World War III is going to kick off next week.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:32.080]   There's a lot more practicality to be concerned with. What's the size of property that you
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:37.080]   have and the size and amount of storage that you have? You can prepare effectively on any
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:42.280]   budget. You can prepare effectively on any size of property. You can prepare effectively
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:47.560]   in any of these circumstances if you will think and be strategic. The most important
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:54.160]   thing for you to develop is knowledge and skills, because with knowledge and skills
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:59.840]   you can do well with stuff and without stuff. But without knowledge and skills, the stuff
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:06.400]   isn't really going to be as useful.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.960]   I believe that I have something unique to offer to help you triage all the different
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:15.080]   decisions that you could make and help you make good decisions. The concern that a lot
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.200]   of people who teach prepping have is that people see something that scares them. It
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.720]   could be the coronavirus. It could be the idea of an economic collapse, hyperinflation.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:31.200]   It could be the idea of nuclear war. But people see something that scares them and all of
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.720]   a sudden they go hardcore, but they don't have an intelligent plan. So they buy pallets
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:41.080]   of food for Y2K that they just wind up sitting around cluttering up their life and finally
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:46.280]   get disgusted a few years later and throw it all away. They feel stupid because they
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:53.680]   wasted $20,000 on pallets of food and nothing bad happened. Or they ran out and they spent
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:59.760]   $1,000 on medical supplies and then the coronavirus didn't turn out to be anything.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.860]   And there are a lot of people who, because of this preparation, have this weird fixation
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:09.560]   on almost hoping things happen. Now I think I'm not immune to that. I think most people
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.860]   who do something do hope at some point. You don't want to admit it, but you probably
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:19.420]   hope that you're vindicated in all of your planning and your preparation. But any thoughtful
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.920]   person of course realizes that's silly. Well, one of the ways that you avoid that
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:27.480]   problem of hoping that everything goes wrong is just by simply doing stuff sensibly and
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:33.640]   thoughtfully and carefully. So that's what you can expect if you sign up for my live
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:38.280]   webinar classes. So I want to just give you a special invitation. We're kicking it off
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:48.680]   on Monday, February 3. I'm surveying the students today to see what's the best time
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.160]   of day, whether you want an evening class, you want a daytime class. My guess it'll
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:58.840]   be an evening class during Eastern time zone. But I will survey the students and go with
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.080]   whatever is the most popular. So if you would like to sign up, I would encourage you to
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:09.360]   do that. Go to radicalpreparedness.com. And that will forward you through to the purchase
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:15.220]   page. You can sign up for my live webinar series, 29 bucks. Deal of a lifetime. I'm
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:20.760]   doing an experiment with this, offering a low-priced course. I generally don't like
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:28.220]   to do a lot of low-priced stuff because it often just doesn't feel as motivating to
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:33.360]   me as doing something higher priced. But I'm doing it as an experiment. So if 10,000 of
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.480]   you sign up for that, then maybe I'll do more low-priced stuff. But I'd love for you
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:41.960]   to join me. Go to radicalpreparedness.com and sign up today. Radicalpreparedness.com.
