[00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:22.820]   but often leads to death. So in this situation if you're prepared and you know that I don't have to rush out and buy supplies the last moment you can minimize your contact with other people who might be contagious. That could be the thing that keeps you from getting sick. You don't know and how could you ever prove that. But if a lot of people around you are contagious and you're going out rushing out trying to figure out how to buy supplies the last minute that could be the thing that keeps you from getting sick.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.820]   That could be the thing that keeps you from getting sick.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.820]   That could be the thing that keeps you from getting sick.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.820]   That could be the thing that keeps you from getting sick.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.820]   That could be the thing that keeps you from getting sick.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.820]   That could be the thing that keeps you from getting sick.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.820]   That could be the thing that keeps you from getting sick.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.820]   That could be the thing that keeps you from getting sick.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:51.020]  , that could be the thing that keeps you from getting sick.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:59.500]   Just simply avoiding those situations that often wind up being dangerous is one of the best ways to increase your survivability in life.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:11.900]   So you don't know but if you have the ability to stay at home and relax and not rush out last minute to try to go get supplies you may minimize the risk of you and your family becoming sick which could actually save your life.
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.420]   Which that's one of the reasons why it's so important to prepare.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.980]   So prepare in advance for anything.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.180]   Prepare in advance so that you can have a very different experience
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.180]   Prepare in advance so that you can have a very different experience
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.180]   Prepare in advance so that you can have a very different experience
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.180]   Prepare in advance so that you can have a very different experience
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.180]   Prepare in advance so that you can have a very different experience
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.180]   Prepare in advance so that you can have a very different experience
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.180]   Prepare in advance so that you can have a very different experience
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.180]   Prepare in advance so that you can have a very different experience
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:47.340]  , of a catastrophe. Catastrophes are hard enough when you're prepared.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:47.420]   Catastrophes are hard enough when you're prepared. But when you are unprepared they become that much harder.
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:47.420]   But when you are unprepared they become that much harder. And if you care about yourself, you care about your family, you don't want to see them go through any greater difficulty than is absolutely necessary. And it certainly is not fun to know I could have done something else but I didn't. That's a really bad feeling. Regret stinks. If you've done all you can and the situation is more than you can do.
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:47.420]  , and the situation is more than you can do something else.
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:47.420]   I could have done all you can do something else.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:08:08.260]   Fine. You did all you can and you just figure it out when you're in the middle of it. But if you know that you ignored, you were ignorant, you ignored the things that you could do just because you were lazy or some other reason, that's a hard situation to be in.
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:14.320]   So I want to tell you a little bit more now about what I'm doing. When I recorded yesterday's show I didn't have a lot of details because I just decided to do it the day before.

[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:55.600]   is a challenge. You don't actually know when you've said something that was confusing. You don't actually know when you've said something that was boring because you don't know when people are tuning out. You don't actually know when you've said something offensive that you would like to clarify but you don't know until days later when all of a sudden you get a rash of emails and then you go ahead and clarify those points. It's one thing that makes it extremely challenging.

[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.880]   I'm going to give you a comprehensive, basically Joshua's
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:44.300]   comprehensive course on on practical preparedness, how to be
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.840]   prepared in case the financial systems fall apart.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:53.000]   I repeated I believe and I have repeatedly emphasized that frankly,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I believe and I have repeatedly emphasized that frankly,

[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I believe and I have repeatedly emphasized that frankly,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I believe and I have repeatedly emphasized that frankly, money is one of the most important things in the financial system.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I believe and I have repeatedly emphasized that frankly, money is one of the most important things in the financial system.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:22.260]   I believe and I have repeatedly emphasized that frankly, money is one of the most important things in the financial system. As long as everything is working simply in the economic system, money is almost always your best preparation. And financial instruments are almost always your best preparation. But when something goes wacky in the market, when all of a sudden there's a fear about a new flu virus and then the stores are emptied out of respirator masks and you can't find bleach on the shelves anywhere, which I would guess right now is probably going to be the case, if not already in many parts of the world.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.560]   If not already in many parts of the world.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.300]   If not already in many parts of the world.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.640]   It depends on what happens with the virus in the coming days as information emerges.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.680]   Hopefully it's nothing and it just, it was all a bunch of concern over nothing.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:44.660]   But if it actually turns into something significant, you won't be able to find bleach, you won't be able to find nitrile gloves, you won't be able to find respirator masks, you won't be able to find any of that stuff because it's quickly taken up.
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.960]   And one of the biggest dangers in the modern world is supply chain management.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.520]   With a just-in-time inventory system, which leads to very profitable companies and a really good system,
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:51.520]   With a just-in-time inventory system, which leads to very profitable companies and a really good system,
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:51.520]   With a just-in-time inventory system, which leads to very profitable companies and a really good system,
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:14:21.380]  ,
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:21.400]   For most situations it collapses during times of panic and times of hoarding, where people rush out and buy everything.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:21.420]   And I think we all do it.
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:21.420]   I went to the store yesterday and I bought a bunch more masks.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.700]   I went to the store yesterday and I bought a bunch more masks.
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.820]   That keeps us from being infected by a flu virus.
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.920]   That keeps us from being infected by a flu virus.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.360]   That seems like a pretty decent use of $20.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.280]   But what does that do?
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.220]   That wipes out things for the next guy.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.600]   All right, next guy comes along and sees that all of a sudden all of the N95 masks are gone from the shelf.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.720]   All right, next guy comes along and sees that all of a sudden all of the N95 masks are gone from the shelf.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.980]   And now he starts to worry.
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.380]   And so he goes to the next store over and says, "Oh, they have some."
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.480]   And so he grabs them.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.160]   And the panic just builds and builds and builds.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.780]   That it's a contagion of sorts, a contagion of emotion, a contagion of panic.
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.680]   And so he grabs them.

[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:06.820]   and sugar and salt and peanut butter and jelly because it's insanely cheap and yet gives you massive amounts of calories it's easy to to provide and that it fits the needs if you eat rice and beans rice and beans right there's a reason why these are time-tested staples now you can also get a lot of bang for your buck with something like buying wheat and an actual wheat itself but then there's a whole other set of costs associated with it for example you have to have a wheat grinder well a good wheat grinder

[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:17.680]   Live Webinar Series 29$ Deal of a lifetime I am doing an experiment with this offering
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:23.180]   a kind of a low priced course I generally don't like to do a lot of low priced stuff
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:29.620]   because it's not enough it often doesn't feel as it's not as motivating to me as doing
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:35.420]   something higher priced but I'm doing it as an experiment so if 10,000 of you sign up for that then maybe I'll do
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:35.420]   more low priced stuff but I'd love for you to sign up for that.
