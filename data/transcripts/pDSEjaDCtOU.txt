[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   The following is a conversation with Ian Hutchinson,
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.400]   a nuclear engineer and plasma physicist at MIT.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.360]   He has made a number of important contributions
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.960]   in plasma physics, including the magnetic confinement
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.880]   of plasmas, seeking to enable fusion reactions,
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.840]   which happens to be the energy source of the stars,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.240]   to be used for practical energy production.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.200]   Current nuclear reactors, by the way,
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.920]   are based on fission, as we discuss.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.460]   Ian has also written on the philosophy of science
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.520]   and the relationship between science and religion,
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.280]   arguing in particular against scientism,
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.680]   which is a negative description of the overreach
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.560]   of the scientific method to questions not amenable to it.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.120]   On this latter topic, I recommend two of his books,
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.000]   his new one, "Can a Scientist Believe in Miracles?"
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.880]   where he answers more than 200 questions
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.000]   on all aspects of God and science,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.440]   and his earlier book on scientism
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.200]   called "Monopolizing Knowledge."
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.200]   As you may have seen already,
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.820]   I work hard on having an open mind,
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.420]   always questioning my assumptions,
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.620]   and in general, marvel at the immense mystery
[00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.420]   of everything around us and the limitations
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.540]   of at least my mind.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.020]   I'm not religious myself, in that I don't go to the synagogue,
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.760]   a church, or mosque, but I see the beautiful bond
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.500]   in the community that religion at its best can create.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.760]   I also see, both in scientists and religious leaders,
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.760]   signs of arrogance, hypocrisy, greed, and a will to power.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.500]   We're human, whether Buddhist, Christian,
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.620]   Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, agnostic, or atheist.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.420]   This podcast is my humble attempt
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.500]   to explore a complicated human nature,
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.980]   what Stanislav Lem in his book "Solaris"
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.700]   called our own labyrinth of dark passages
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.660]   and secret chambers.
[00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.100]   I ask that you try to keep an open mind as well,
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.660]   and be patient with the limitations of mind.
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.620]   Quick summary of the ads, two new amazing sponsors,

[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.560]   As you may know, my diet is pretty minimalist,
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.860]   so it's nice to get some healthy variety into the mix.
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.460]   They make it super easy,
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.020]   with everything pre-portioned and ready to prep and cook.

[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.260]   in as little as 15 minutes.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.500]   I just ordered my first set of meals.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.820]   Haven't gotten them yet, but I can't wait.
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.980]   I just finished the six-mile run
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.860]   and thousand body weight reps, and I'm starving,
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.860]   but let me risk listing the actual menu items that I ordered
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.500]   'cause they sound delicious.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.300]   Italian sausages and vegetable skewers with two romescos.
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.860]   I don't actually know what romescos are,
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.920]   but the pictures looked awesome.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.380]   And pork fried cauliflower rice with carrots and peas.
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.500]   By the way, cauliflower rice
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.700]   is one of my favorite things ever.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.000]   Right now, SunBasket is offering $35 off your order.

[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.740]   They told me to say right now, with urgency.
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.220]   So pause this podcast and go to the website
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.520]   and make the purchase,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.220]   or just go to the website and check it out.

[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.340]   This thing is amazing.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.100]   It's an e-stim, electrical stimulation device
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.520]   that I've been using a lot for muscle recovery recently,
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.700]   mostly for my shoulders and legs
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.240]   as I've been doing the 1,000 body weight reps
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.340]   and six miles every day as I just finished.
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.420]   They call it the smart muscle stimulator, which is true.
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.140]   Since the app that goes with it is amazing.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.700]   It has 15 programs for different body parts
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.060]   and guides you through everything you need to do.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.900]   I take recovery really seriously these days.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.260]   And PowerDot has been a powerful addition
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.300]   to the whole regime of stretching, ice, massage,
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.440]   and sleep and diet that I do.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.180]   It's used by professional athletes and by slightly insane,
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.100]   but mostly normal people like me.
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.980]   It's portable, so you can throw it in a bag
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.380]   and bring it anywhere.
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.260]   Get it at powerdot.com/LEX and use code LEX at checkout

[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.120]   And now, here's my conversation with Ian Hutchinson.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.980]   Maybe it'd be nice to draw a distinction
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.100]   between nuclear physics and plasma physics.
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.100]   What is the distinction?
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.700]   - Nuclear physics is about the physics of the nucleus
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.520]   and my department, Department of Nuclear Science
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.180]   and Engineering at MIT, is very concerned
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.820]   about all the interactions and reactions
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.300]   and consequences of things that go on in the nucleus,
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.140]   including nuclear energy, fission energy,
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.460]   which is the nuclear energy that we have already,
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.660]   and fusion energy, which is the energy source
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.740]   of the sun and stars, which we don't quite know
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.740]   how to turn into practical energy
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.100]   for humankind at the moment.
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.840]   That's what my research has mostly been aimed at.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.840]   But plasmas are essentially the fourth state of matter.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.040]   So if you think about solid, liquid, gas,
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.960]   plasma is the fourth of those states of matter.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.580]   And it's actually the state of matter which one reaches
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.320]   if one raises the temperature.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.900]   So cold things, like ice, are solid.
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.180]   Liquids are hotter, water, and if you heat water
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.640]   beyond 100 degrees Celsius, it becomes gas.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.640]   Well, that's true of most substances.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.640]   And plasma is a state of matter in which the electrons
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:03.240]   are unbound from the nuclei, so they become separate
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.240]   from the nuclei and can move separately.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.640]   So we have positively charged nuclei
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.320]   and we have negatively charged electrons.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   The net is still electrically neutral,
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.480]   but a plasma conducts electricity,
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.740]   has all sorts of important properties
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.240]   that are associated with that separation,
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.420]   and that's what plasmas are all about.
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.720]   And the reason why my department is interested
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.400]   in plasma physics very strongly is because most things,
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.140]   well, for one thing, most things in the universe are plasma.
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.600]   The vast majority of matter in the universe is plasma.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   But most particularly, stars and the sun are plasmas
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.800]   because they're very hot.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.240]   And it's only in very hot states
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.760]   that nuclear fusion reactions take place.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.880]   And we want to understand how to implement
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.560]   those kind of phenomena on Earth.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.720]   - Maybe another distinction we wanna try to get at
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.240]   is the difference between fission and fusion.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.100]   So you mentioned fusion is the kind of reaction
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.000]   happening in the sun.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.520]   So what's fission and what's fusion?
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.540]   - Sure.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:16.440]   Well, fission is taking heavy elements like uranium
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.280]   and breaking them up.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.320]   And it turns out that that process
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.960]   of breaking up heavy elements releases energy.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.120]   - What does it mean to be a heavy element?
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.200]   - It means that there are many nuclear particles
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.240]   in the nucleus itself, neutrons and protons
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.200]   in the nucleus itself, so that in the case
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.200]   of uranium, there are 92 protons in each nucleus
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.000]   and even more neutrons so that the total number
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   of nucleons in the nucleus, nucleons is short
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.340]   for either a proton or a neutron,
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.800]   the total number might be 235, that's U-235,
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.640]   or it might be 238, that's U-238.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.020]   So those are heavy elements.
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.140]   Light elements, by contrast, have very few nucleons,
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.820]   protons or neutrons in the nucleus.
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.740]   Hydrogen is the lightest nucleus.
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.700]   It has one proton.
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.680]   There are actually slightly heavier forms
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.340]   of hydrogen, isotopes.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.980]   Deuterium has a proton and a neutron
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.180]   and tritium has a proton and two neutrons.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.980]   So it has a total of three nucleons in the nucleus.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:35.860]   Well, taking light elements like isotopes of hydrogen
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:40.300]   and not breaking them up but actually fusing them together,
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.660]   reacting them together to produce heavier elements,
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.660]   typically helium, okay, which is, helium is a nucleus
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.660]   which has two protons and two neutrons,
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.660]   that also releases energy and that, or reactions like that,
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.900]   making heavier elements from lighter elements
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.860]   is what mostly powers the sun and stars.
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.860]   Both fusion and fission release approximately
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.540]   a million times more energy per unit mass
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.240]   than chemical reactions.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.200]   So a chemical reaction means take hydrogen,
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.900]   take oxygen, react them together, let's say,
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.940]   and get water, that releases energy.
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.320]   The energy released in a chemical reaction like that
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.880]   or the burning of coal or oil or whatever else
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.480]   is about a million times less per unit mass
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.360]   than what is released in nuclear reactions.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.800]   - So, but it's hard to do.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.800]   - It requires very high energy of impact
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.360]   and actually it's very easy to understand why
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.520]   and that is that those two nuclei,
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.760]   if they're both, let's say, hydrogen nuclei,
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.240]   one is, let's say, deuterium
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.240]   and the other is, let's say, tritium,
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.400]   they're both electrically charged
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.240]   and they're positively charged,
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.800]   so they, like charges, repel.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.440]   Everyone knows that, right?
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.720]   So basically, to get them close enough together to react,
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.920]   you have to overcome the repulsion,
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   the electric repulsion of the two nuclei from one another
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.600]   and you have to get them extremely close to one another
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.360]   in order for the nuclear forces
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.840]   to overtake the electrical forces
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.640]   and actually form a new nucleus.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.480]   And so, one requires very high energies of impact
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.240]   in order for reactions to take place
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.040]   and those high energies of impact
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.840]   correspond to very high temperatures of random motion.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.880]   - So that's why you can do stuff like that in the sun.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.560]   So we can build the sun, that's one way to do it,
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.560]   but on Earth, how do you create a fusion reaction?
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.360]   Engineering-wise.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.280]   - Nature's fusion reactors are indeed the stars
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.200]   and they are very hot in the center
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   and they reach the point where they release more energy
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.920]   from those reactions than they lose by radiation
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.840]   and transport to the surface and so forth
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.920]   and that's a state of ignition.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:19.280]   And that's what we have to achieve to give net energy.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.160]   It's like lighting a fire.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.760]   If you have a bundle of sticks
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.920]   and you hold a match up to it
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.680]   and you see smoke coming from the sticks,
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.120]   but you take the match away and the sticks just fizzle out,
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.360]   the reason they fizzled out is that,
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.800]   yes, they were burning, there was smoke coming from them,
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.240]   but they were not ignited.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.560]   But if you are able to take the match away
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.840]   and they keep burning and they are generating enough heat
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.440]   to keep themselves hot and hence keep the reactions going,
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.800]   that's chemical ignition.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.920]   But what we need to do, what the stars do,
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.200]   in order to generate nuclear fusion energy
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.400]   is they are ignited.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.080]   They are generating enough energy to keep themselves hot
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.960]   and that's what we've got to do on Earth
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.640]   if we're going to make fusion work on Earth.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.920]   But it's much harder to do on Earth
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.160]   than it is in a star
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.560]   because we need temperatures of order
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.480]   tens of millions of degrees Celsius
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.120]   in order for the reactions to go fast enough
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.360]   to generate enough electricity to keep it,
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.520]   or enough energy to keep it going.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:40.280]   And so, if you've got something
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.040]   that's tens of millions of degrees Celsius
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.360]   and you want to keep it all together
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.280]   and keep the heat in long enough
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.400]   to have enough reactions taking place,
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.080]   you can't just put it in a bottle,
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:56.240]   plastic or glass, it would be gone in milliseconds.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:02.200]   So, you have to have some non-material mechanism
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.080]   of confining the plasma.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.880]   In the case of stars, that non-material force is gravity.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.200]   So gravity is what holds a star together,
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.280]   it's what holds the plasma in long enough
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:21.280]   for it to react and sustain itself by the fusion reactions.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.800]   But on Earth, gravity is extremely weak.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.360]   I mean, I don't mean to say we don't fall,
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.360]   well, yes, we fall,
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.360]   but the mutual gravitational attraction of small objects
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.880]   is very weak compared with the electrical repulsion
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.240]   or any other force that you can think about on Earth.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.480]   And so, we need a stronger force
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.840]   to keep the plasma together, to confine it.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:52.800]   And the predominant attempt at making fusion work on Earth
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.360]   is to use magnetic fields to confine the plasma.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.000]   And that's what I've worked on
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.640]   for essentially most of my career,
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.960]   is to understand how we can and how best we can
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.000]   confine these incredibly hot gases, plasmas,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.400]   using magnetic fields with the ultimate objective
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.200]   of releasing fusion energy on Earth
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   and generating electricity with it
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.320]   and powering our society with it.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.480]   - Dumb question.
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.440]   So on top of the magnetic fields,
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.320]   do you also need the plastic water bottle walls
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.340]   or is it purely magnetic fields?
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.060]   - Well, actually, what we do need walls,
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:36.720]   those walls must be kept away from the plasma
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.900]   'cause otherwise they'd be melted.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.720]   Well, the plasma must be kept away from them
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.240]   inside of them.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.760]   But the main purpose of the walls
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.120]   is not to keep the plasma in,
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.120]   it's to keep the atmosphere out.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.880]   So if we want to do it on Earth where there's air,
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.200]   we want the plasma to consist of hydrogen isotopes
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.600]   or other things, the things we're trying to react.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.160]   And by the way, the density of those plasmas,
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.000]   at least in magnetic confinement fusion, is very low.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.940]   It's maybe a million times less
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.920]   than the density of air in this room.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.480]   So in order for a fusion reactor like that to work,
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.340]   you have to keep all of the air out
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.720]   and just keep the plasma in.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.640]   So yes, there are other things,
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.320]   but those are things that are relatively easy.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.840]   I mean, making a vacuum these days
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.200]   is technologically quite straightforward.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.280]   We know how to do that, okay?
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.960]   What we don't quite know how to do
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.940]   is to make a confinement device
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.600]   that isolates the plasma well enough
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.440]   so that it's able to keep itself burning
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.860]   with its own reaction.
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.360]   - So maybe, can you talk about what a tokamak is?
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.520]   - The Russian acronym from which the word tokamak is built
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.960]   just means toroidal magnetic chamber.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.680]   So it's a toroidal chamber.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.440]   A torus is a geometric shape which is like a donut
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.640]   with a hole down the middle, okay?
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.400]   And so it's the meat of the donut, okay?
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.520]   That's the torus.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.640]   And it's got a magnetic field.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.280]   So that's really all tokamak means.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.120]   But the particular configuration
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:21.600]   that is very widespread and is the sort of best prospect,
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.080]   at least in the near term, for making fusion energy work
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.480]   is one in which there's a very strong magnetic field
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.020]   the long way around the donut, around the torus.
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.760]   So you've got to imagine that there's this donut shape
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.400]   with an embedded magnetic field
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.280]   just going round and round the long way.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.280]   The big advantage of that is that plasma particles,
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:54.640]   when they're in the presence of a magnetic field,
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.120]   feel strong forces from the magnetic field.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.120]   And those forces make the particles gyrate
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.240]   around the direction of the magnetic field line.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:09.240]   So basically, the particles follow helical orbits,
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.580]   following like a spring
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.920]   that's directed along the magnetic field.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.640]   Well, if you make the magnetic field
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.720]   go inside this toroidal chamber
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.340]   and just simply go round and round the chamber,
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.720]   then because of this helical orbit,
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.700]   the particles can't move fast across the magnetic field,
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.760]   but they can move very quickly along the magnetic field.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.200]   And if you have a magnetic field
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.240]   that doesn't leave the chamber,
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.560]   it doesn't matter if they move along the magnetic field.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.200]   It doesn't mean they're going to exit the chamber.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.080]   But if you just had a straight magnetic field,
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.080]   for example, coming from a Helmholtz coil or a bar magnet,
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.280]   then you'd have to have ends.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.880]   It would come to the ends of the chamber somewhere
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.480]   and the particles would hit the ends
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.840]   and they would lose their energy.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.440]   So that's why it's toroidal
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.040]   and that's why we have a strong magnetic field.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.040]   It's providing a confinement against motion
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.460]   in the direction that would lead the particles
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.940]   to leave the chamber.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:17.840]   It turns out that,
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.120]   here we're getting a little bit technical,
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.140]   but it turns out that a toroidal field alone is not enough.
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.200]   And so you need more fields
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.740]   to produce true confinement of plasma.
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.560]   And we get those by passing a current as well
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.280]   through the plasma itself.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.720]   - Like to make sure it stays on track.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.880]   - Well, what that does is makes the field lines themselves
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.520]   into much bigger helices.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.460]   And that's for reasons that are too complicated to explain,
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.760]   that clinches the confinement of the particles,
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.240]   at least in terms of their single particle orbit.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.300]   So they don't leave the chamber.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.300]   - So when the particles are flying along this donut,
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.920]   the inside of the donut,
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.920]   where's the generation of the energy coming from?
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.140]   Are they smashing into each other?
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.820]   - Yeah, eventually, I mean, in a fusion reactor,
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.300]   there will be deutrons and tritons
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.820]   and they will be smashing in.
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.500]   They will be very hot.
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.740]   There'll be a hundred million degrees Celsius or something.
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.640]   So they're moving thermally
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.120]   with very large thermal energies in random directions,
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.880]   and they will collide with one another
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.280]   and have fusion reactions.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.620]   When those fusion reactions take place,
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.080]   energy is released, large amounts of energy is released
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.120]   in the form of particles.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.920]   One of the particles that's released is an alpha particle,
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.600]   which is also charged and it's also confined.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.140]   And that alpha particle stays in the donut
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.980]   and heats the other particles that are in that donut.
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.440]   So it transfers its energy to those and it keeps them hot.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.880]   There's some leaking of heat all the time,
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.200]   a little bit of radiation, some transport and so forth.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.640]   There's also a neutron released from that reaction.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.320]   The neutron carries out 4/5 of the fusion energy
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.680]   and that will have to be captured in a blanket
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.680]   that surrounds the chamber in which we take the energy,
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:16.960]   drive some kind of electrical generator
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.960]   from a thermal engine, gas turbine or something like that,
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.140]   and power the--
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.360]   - And you got energy.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.040]   So where do we stand?
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.280]   - Where do we stand?
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.180]   - On getting this thing to be something
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.880]   that actually works, that generates energy.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.240]   - Yep.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.960]   Well, there have been experiments
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.600]   that have generated net nuclear energies
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   or nuclear powers in the vicinity of a few tens of megawatts.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.600]   For a few seconds.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.640]   So that's 10 megajoules.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.440]   That's not much energy.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.480]   It's a few donuts worth of energy.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.320]   Okay.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.160]   Literal donut.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.860]   - Literal donut, that's right.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:07.400]   - But we have studied how well Tokamaks can find plasmas.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   And so we now understand in rather great detail
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.280]   the way they work.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.080]   And we're able to predict what is going to be required
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.880]   in order to build a Tokamak that becomes self-sustaining,
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.840]   that becomes essentially ignited
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.660]   or so close to ignited that it doesn't matter.
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:33.640]   And at the moment, at least if you use
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.200]   the modest magnetic field values, still very strong,
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.560]   but limited magnetic field values,
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.560]   you have to build a very big device.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.400]   And so we are at the moment,
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.400]   worldwide fusion research is at the moment
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.640]   in the process of building a very big experiment
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.960]   that's located in the South of France.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.660]   It's called ITER, I-T-E-R, which means the way
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.080]   or just means the International Tokamak Experimental Reactor
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:05.920]   if you like.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.720]   And that experiment is designed
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.000]   to reach this burning plasma state
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   and to generate about 500 megawatts of fusion power
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.240]   for hundreds of seconds at a time.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.320]   It'll still only be an experiment.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.560]   It won't put electricity on the grid or anything like that.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.480]   It's to figure out whether it works
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.320]   and what the remaining engineering challenges are.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.120]   It's a scientific experiment.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.520]   It won't be engineered to run round the clock
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.760]   and so on and so forth, which ultimately one needs to do
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.400]   in order to make something that's practical
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.120]   for generating electricity.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.040]   But it will be the first demonstration on earth
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   of a controlled fusion reaction for a long time period.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.160]   - Is that exciting to you?
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:02.440]   - It's been an objective that is in many ways
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.520]   motivated my entire career
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.560]   and the career of many people like me in the field.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.020]   I have to admit though that one of the problems with ITER
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.820]   is that it's an extremely big and expensive
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.660]   and long time to build experiment.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.380]   And so it won't even come into operation until about 2025,
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.780]   even though it's been being built for 10 years
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.100]   and it was designed for 30 years before that.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:37.180]   And so that's actually one of the big disappointments
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.660]   of my career in a certain sense,
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:44.460]   which is that we won't get to a burning fusion reaction
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.260]   until well past the first operation of ITER.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.340]   And whether I'm alive or not, I don't know,
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.700]   but I certainly will be well and truly retired
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.380]   by the time that happens.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.380]   And so when I realized maybe some years ago
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.460]   that that was gonna be the case,
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.260]   it was a discouragement to me, let's put it like that.
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:08.100]   - But if we can try to look maybe in a ridiculous kind of way
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.380]   look into 100 years from now, 200 years, 500 years from now,
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.580]   and there's folks like Elon Musk
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.660]   trying to travel outside the solar system.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.380]   I mean, the amount of energy we need
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:23.420]   for some of the exciting things we wanna do in this world,
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.020]   if we look again, 100 years from now,
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.200]   seems to be a very large amount.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.000]   So do you think fusion energy will eventually,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.900]   sometime into your retirement,
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:40.900]   will be basically behind most of the things we do?
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.500]   - Look, I absolutely think that fusion research
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.200]   is completely justified.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.900]   In fact, we should be spending more time and effort on it
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.700]   than we currently do.
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.100]   But it isn't going to be a magic bullet
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.460]   that somehow solves all the problems of energy.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.340]   By the way, that's a generic statement
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.340]   you can make about any energy source, in my view.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.460]   I think it's a grave mistake to think that science
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.660]   of any sort is suddenly going to find a magic bullet
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.780]   for meeting all the energy needs of society,
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.460]   or any of the other needs of society, by the way.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.580]   And we can talk about that, I hope, later, okay?
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.980]   - Yes, definitely.
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.360]   - But fusion is very worthwhile and we should be doing it.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:29.660]   And so my disappointment that I just expressed
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.980]   was in a certain sense a personal disappointment.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.580]   I do think that fusion energy is a terrific challenge.
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.660]   It's very difficult to bring the energy source
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.200]   of the sun and stars down to Earth.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   This does contrast, in a certain sense, with fission energy.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.500]   By contrast, fission energy,
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.600]   to build a fission reactor proved to be amazingly easy.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:59.700]   We did it within a few years of discovering nuclear fission.
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.100]   People had figured out how to build a reactor
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.620]   and did so during the Second World War.
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.480]   - Which is, by the way, fission is how
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.260]   the current nuclear power plants work.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:15.620]   - Yeah, and so we have nuclear energy today
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:20.460]   because fission reactors are relatively easy to build.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.620]   You've gotta have, what's hard is getting the materials,
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.060]   okay, and that's just as well,
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.500]   because if everyone could get those materials,
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.420]   there would be weapons proliferation and so forth.
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.660]   But it wasn't all that long
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:37.740]   after even the discovery of nuclear fission
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.340]   that fission reactors were built,
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.620]   and fission reactors, of course,
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.680]   operated before we had weapons.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:49.000]   So I think nuclear power is obviously important
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:57.020]   to meet the energy challenges of our age.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.460]   It is completely, intrinsically,
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:03.980]   completely CO2 emissions free,
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.820]   and in fact, the wastes that come from nuclear power,
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.340]   whether it's fission or fusion for that matter,
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:14.020]   are so moderate in quantity
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:18.300]   that we shouldn't really be worried about them.
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:21.180]   I mean, yes, fission products are highly radioactive
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.640]   and we need to keep them away from people,
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.900]   but there's so little of them
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.520]   it's that keeping them away from people
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.540]   is not particularly difficult.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.260]   And so while people complain a lot
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.140]   about the drawbacks of fission energy,
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:39.060]   I think most of those complaints are ill-informed.
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.300]   We can talk about the challenges and the disasters,
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.860]   if you like, of fission reactors,
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.060]   but I think fission, in the near term,
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.460]   offers a terrific opportunity
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.860]   for environmentally friendly energy,
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.800]   which in the world as a whole
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.240]   is rapidly being taken advantage of.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.360]   You know, China and India and places like that
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.720]   are rapidly building fission plants.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.000]   We're not rapidly building fission plants in the US,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.600]   although we are actually building two at the moment,
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:15.140]   two new ones, but we do still get 20% of our electricity
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.160]   from fission energy and we could get a lot more.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.600]   - So it's clean energy.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.880]   - So it's clean energy.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.840]   - Now, again, the concern is,
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.500]   there's a very popular HBO show
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.500]   and it just came out on Chernobyl.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.560]   There's the Three Mile Island, there's Fukushima,
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.380]   that's the most recent disaster.
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.360]   So there's a kind of a concern of,
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.460]   yeah, I mean, of nuclear disasters.
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.860]   Is that, what would you make of that kind of concern,
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.380]   especially if we look into the future
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.780]   of fission energy-based reactors?
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.580]   - Well, first of all, let me say one or two words
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.660]   about the contrast between fission and fusion,
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:49.980]   and then we'll come onto the question
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.840]   of the disasters and so forth.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.660]   Fission does have some drawbacks
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:59.660]   and they're largely to do with four main areas.
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:04.660]   One is, do we have enough uranium or other fissile fuels
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.980]   to supply our energy needs for a long time?
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:12.980]   The answer to that is we know we have enough uranium
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:18.160]   to support fission energy worldwide for thousands of years,
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.480]   but maybe not for millions of years, okay?
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.160]   So that's resources.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.800]   Secondly, there are issues to do with wastes.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.960]   Fission wastes are highly radioactive
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.840]   and some of them are volatile.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.840]   And so, for example, in Fukushima,
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.120]   the problem was that some fraction
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.600]   of the fission waste were volatilized
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:49.360]   and went out as a cloud and polluted areas
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.360]   with cesium-137, strontium-90, and things like that.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.640]   So that's a challenge of fission.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:02.200]   There's a problem of safety beyond that,
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.160]   and that is that in fission,
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.440]   it's hard to turn the reactor off.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.640]   When you stop the nuclear reactions,
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.720]   there is still a lot of heat being liberated
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.480]   from the fission products.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.200]   And that is actually what the problem was
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.520]   at Fukushima.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.800]   The Fukushima reactors were shut down
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.880]   the moment that the earthquake took place,
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.720]   and they were shut down safely.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.040]   What then happened after that at Fukushima was,
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.220]   you know, there was this enormous tidal wave,
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:40.200]   many tens of meters high that came through
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:45.200]   and destroyed the electricity grid feed
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.320]   to the Fukushima reactors.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.840]   And their cooling was then turned off.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.360]   And it was the afterheat of the turned-off reactors
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.640]   that eventually caused the problems that led to release.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.240]   And so that's a safety concern.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:06.240]   And then finally, there's a problem of proliferation.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:10.080]   And that is that fission reactors need fissile fuel,
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.920]   and the technologies for producing,
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.040]   and enriching, and so forth, the fuels,
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.600]   can be used, can be,
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:23.880]   by bad actors to generate the materials needed
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.160]   for a nuclear weapon.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.200]   And that's a very serious concern.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.280]   So those are the four problems.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.280]   Fusion has major advantages
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.440]   in respect of all of those problems.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:39.440]   It has more longer-term fuel resources.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.240]   It has far more benign waste issues.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.240]   The radioactivity from fusion reactions
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:51.240]   is at least 100 times less than it is from fission reactions.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:55.960]   It has essentially none of this afterheat problem
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.960]   because it doesn't produce fission products
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.640]   that are highly radioactive
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.160]   and generating their own heat when it's turned off.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.240]   In fact, the hard part of fusion is turning it on,
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.280]   not turning it off.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:11.920]   And finally, you don't need the same fission technology
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.840]   to make fusion work.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.800]   And so it's got terrific advantages
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.280]   from the point of view of proliferation control.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.640]   So those are four main issues
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.640]   which make fusion seem attractive technologically
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.240]   because they address some of the problems of fission energy.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.200]   I don't mean to say that fission energy
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.040]   is overwhelmingly problematic,
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.040]   but clearly there have been catastrophes
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.800]   associated with fission reactors.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.880]   Fukushima actually is, I think in many ways,
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.400]   often overstated as a disaster
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.800]   because after all, nobody was killed by the reactors,
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.520]   essentially, zero.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:58.520]   And that's in the context of a disaster, a tsunami,
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.440]   that killed between 15 and 20,000 people
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.560]   instantaneously, more or less instantaneously.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:10.040]   So in the scale of risks,
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:15.040]   one should take the view that, in my estimation,
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.360]   that fission energy came out of that looking pretty good.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.600]   Of course, that's not the popular conception.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.360]   - I mean, with a lot of things
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.920]   that threaten our well-being,
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.920]   we seem to be very bad users of data.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.960]   We seem to be very scared of shock attacks
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.400]   and not at all scared of car accidents
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.360]   and this kind of miscalculation.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.880]   And I think from everything I understand,
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.240]   nuclear energy, fission-based energy,
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.640]   goes into that category.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.680]   It's one of the safest,
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.600]   one of the cleanest forms of energy.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.320]   And yet the PR,
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.800]   whoever does the PR for nuclear energy
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.560]   has a hard job ahead of them at the moment.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.520]   - Well, I think part of that
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.960]   is their association with nuclear weapons.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.280]   Because when you say the word nuclear,
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.960]   people don't instantly think about nuclear energy,
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.960]   they think about nuclear weapons.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.960]   And so there is, perhaps, a natural tendency to do that.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.360]   But yes, I agree with you,
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.480]   people are very poor at estimating risks
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.960]   and they react emotionally, not rationally,
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.800]   in most of these situations.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.260]   - Can we talk about nuclear weapons just for a little bit?
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:30.160]   So fission is the kind of reaction
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.960]   that's central to the nuclear weapons we have today?
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.960]   - That's what sets them off.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.520]   - That's what sets them off.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.040]   So if we look at the hydrogen bomb,
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.080]   maybe you can say how these different weapons work.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.240]   - So the earliest nuclear weapons,
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.720]   the nuclear bombs that were dropped on Japan,
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.960]   et cetera, et cetera, were pure fission weapons.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.760]   They used enriched uranium or plutonium
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.040]   and their energy is essentially entirely derived
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.520]   from fission reactions.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:05.520]   But it was early realized that more energy was available
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:11.200]   if one could somehow combine a fission bomb
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.600]   with fusion reactions.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:22.080]   Because the fusion reactions give more energy per unit mass
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.680]   than fission reactions.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:29.480]   And this was called the super.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.240]   You might have heard of the expression the super,
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.480]   or more simply, hydrogen bombs.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.960]   Bombs which use isotopes of hydrogen
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.160]   and the fusion reactions associated with them.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.760]   - Like you said, it's hard to turn on.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.800]   - It's hard to turn on
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.880]   because you need very high temperatures
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.760]   and you need confinement of that long enough
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.880]   for the reactions to take place.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.080]   And so a bomb, actually a thermonuclear bomb,
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.320]   or a hydrogen bomb,
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:03.240]   has essentially a chemical implosion
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.160]   which then sets off a fission explosion
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:15.840]   which then sets off and compresses hydrogen isotopes
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.160]   and other things, which I don't know
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.200]   because I've never had a security clearance, okay?
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.240]   So I can't betray any secrets about weapons
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.040]   'cause I've never been a party to them,
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.320]   'cause I know a lot about this problem, I can guess, okay?
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.520]   And sets off fusion reactions in the middle, okay?
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.680]   So that's basically, it's that sequence of things
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.040]   which produce these enormous multi-megaton bombs
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.120]   that have very large yields.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:52.120]   And so fusion alone can't get you there.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.240]   It is actually possible to set off
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:38:00.080]   or to try to set off little fusion bombs alone
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:05.080]   without the surrounding fission explosion.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.840]   And that is what is called laser fusion.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.840]   So another approach to fusion,
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:16.840]   which actually is mostly researched in the weapons complex,
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.480]   the national labs and so forth,
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.840]   because it's more associated
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.960]   with the technologies of weapons, is inertial fusion.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.040]   So if you decide instead of trying
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:32.680]   to make your plasma just sit there in this torus,
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.760]   in the tokamak and be controlled steady state
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.080]   with a magnetic field, if you're willing to accept
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:41.960]   that I'll just set off an explosion, okay?
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.480]   And then I'll gather the energy from that somehow,
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.520]   I don't quite know how,
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.360]   but let's not ask that question too much,
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:53.000]   then it is possible to imagine
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.360]   generating fusion alone explosions.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.520]   And the way you do it is you take some small amount
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.840]   of deuterium tritium fuel,
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.880]   you bombard it with energy from all sides.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.840]   And this is what the lasers are used for,
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.080]   extremely powerful lasers,
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.640]   which compresses the pellet of fusion and heats it.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.240]   It compresses it to such a high density and temperature
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.240]   that the reactions take place very, very quickly.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.920]   And in fact, they can take place so quickly
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.320]   that it's all over with before the thing flies apart.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.880]   - Wow, so heat it up really fast.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:33.200]   - That is inertial fusion, okay?
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.960]   - Is that useful for energy generation for outside?
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.680]   - No, not yet.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.320]   I mean, there are those people who think it will be,
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.680]   but you may have heard of the big experiment
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.160]   called the National Ignition Facility,
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.720]   which was built at Livermore starting in the late 1990s
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:53.200]   and has been in operation since roundabout 2010.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.040]   It was designed with the claim
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.080]   that it would reach ignition, fusion ignition,
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.760]   in this pulsed form where the reactions are got over with
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.520]   so quickly before the whole thing flies apart.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.040]   It didn't actually reach ignition
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.000]   and it doesn't look as if it will,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.200]   although we never know.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.720]   Maybe people figure out how to make it work better.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.840]   But the answer is, in principle,
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.260]   it seems possible to reach ignition in this way,
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:23.080]   maybe not with that particular laser facility.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.240]   - Are you surprised that we humans
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.320]   haven't destroyed ourselves,
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.940]   given that we've invented such powerful tools of destruction?
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:38.080]   Like, what do you make of the fact that for many decades,
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.980]   we've had nuclear weapons now?
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:42.120]   Speaking about estimating risk,
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.940]   at least to me, it's exceptionally surprising.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.800]   I was born in the Soviet Union,
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:50.800]   that big egos of the big leaders,
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.360]   when rubbing up against each other,
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.880]   have not created the kind of destruction
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:59.800]   everybody was afraid of for decades.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.400]   - Well, I must say I'm extremely thankful that it hasn't.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.440]   I don't know whether I'm surprised about it.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.560]   I've never thought about it from the point of view of,
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.060]   is it surprising that we've avoided it?
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.760]   I'm just very thankful that we have.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.160]   I think that there is a sense in which cooler heads
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.120]   have prevailed at crucial moments.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.320]   I think there is also a sense in which
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:27.320]   mutually assured destruction has in fact worked
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:32.440]   as a policy to restrain the great powers from going to war.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:38.720]   And in fact, the fact that we haven't had a world war
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:45.760]   since the 1940s is perhaps even attributable
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:52.400]   to nuclear weapons in a kind of strange and peculiar way.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:57.600]   But I think humans are deeply flawed and sinful people.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:04.380]   And I certainly don't feel that we're guaranteed
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.360]   that it's gonna go on like this.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.600]   - And we'll talk about the sort of
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.520]   the biggest picture view of it all.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:15.120]   But let me just ask in terms of your worries of,
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.720]   if we look 100 years from now,
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.960]   we're in the middle of what is now a natural pandemic
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.960]   that from the looks of it,
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:27.680]   as fortunately is not as bad as it could possibly been.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.920]   If you look at the Spanish flu,
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.880]   if you look at the history of pandemics,
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.560]   if you look at all the possible pandemics
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.760]   that could have been,
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.120]   that folks like Bill Gates are exceptionally terrified about.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.500]   I know many people are suffering,
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:44.480]   but it's better than it could have been.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.160]   So, and now we're talking about nuclear weapons.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.160]   In terms of existential threats to us as sinful humans,
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.280]   what worries you the most?
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   Is it nuclear weapons?
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.680]   Is it natural pandemics, engineered pandemics,
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.960]   nanotechnology?
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.200]   In my field of artificial intelligence,
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.880]   some people are afraid of killer robots.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.720]   - Robots, yeah.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.320]   - Do you think in those existential terms,
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.660]   and do any aspect, do any of those things worry you?
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:21.440]   - I am certainly not confident
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.920]   that my children and grandchildren
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.320]   will experience the benefits of civilization
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.720]   that I have enjoyed.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.120]   I think it's possible for our civilizations
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.240]   to break down catastrophically.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:39.820]   I also think that it's possible for our civilizations
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.660]   to break down progressively.
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.160]   And I think they will,
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:49.540]   if we continue to have the explosion of population
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.760]   on the planet that we currently have.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.760]   I mean, it's quite wrong to think of our problems
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.000]   as mostly being CO2.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.720]   If we can just solve CO2,
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:05.720]   then we can go on having this continually expanding economy
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.800]   everywhere in the world.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.160]   Of course you can't do that, okay?
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:13.200]   I mean, there is a finite bearing capacity
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.120]   of our planet.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.560]   - On the resources of our planet.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.240]   - On the resources of our planet.
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.580]   And we can't continue to do that.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.200]   So I think there are lots of technical reasons
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:26.680]   why a continually expanding economy
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:31.480]   and civilization is impossible.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.760]   And therefore, actually I'm as much nervous
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.980]   about the fact that our population
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.760]   is eight billion or something right now worldwide
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:44.800]   as I am about the fact that a few million people
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.000]   would be killed by COVID-19.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.120]   I mean, I don't want to be callous about this,
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.120]   but from the big picture,
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.920]   it seems like that's much more of a problem.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.960]   Overpopulation, people not dying
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:03.960]   is ultimately more of a problem than people dying.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.200]   So that probably sounds incredibly callous
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.520]   to your listeners,
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:13.520]   but I think it's simply a sober assessment of the situation.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:18.120]   - Is there ways from the way those eight billion
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.440]   or seven billion or whatever the number is live
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.340]   that could make it sustainable?
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.560]   'Cause you've kind of implied there's a kind of,
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.840]   we have especially in the West,
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.160]   this kind of capitalist view
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.160]   of really consuming a lot of resources.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.020]   Is there a way to,
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.260]   if you could change one thing or a few things,
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.840]   what would you change to make this life,
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.440]   make it more likely that your grandchildren
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.000]   have a better life than you?
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.640]   - Well, okay, so let's talk a bit about energy
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.880]   because that's something I know a lot about
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.600]   having thought about it most of my career.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:00.160]   In order to reach a steady state CO2 level, okay,
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.040]   that's acceptable in terms of global climate change
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.240]   and so on and so forth,
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:09.880]   we need to reduce our carbon emissions
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.120]   by at least a factor of 10 worldwide, okay?
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.440]   What's more, you know,
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:21.780]   the average energy consumption and hence CO2 emission
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.400]   of people in the world is less than a 10th
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:30.400]   of what we per capita of than what we have in the West,
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.240]   in America and Europe and so forth.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.100]   So if you have in mind some utopia in the future
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:39.900]   where we've reached a sustainable use of energy
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:43.380]   and we've also reached a situation
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:47.900]   in which there's far less inequity in the world
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.660]   in the sense that people have,
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:53.600]   share the energy resources more uniformly,
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.060]   then what that is equivalent to
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:47:01.060]   would be to reduce the CO2 emissions in Western economies,
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.140]   not by a factor of 10, but by a factor of 100.
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:06.940]   In other words, it has to go down to 1%
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.220]   of what it is now, okay?
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:11.380]   So, you know, when people talk about,
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:14.220]   you know, let's use natural gas
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:18.580]   'cause maybe it only uses 60% of the energy of coal,
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.060]   it's complete nonsense.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.300]   That's not even scratching the surface
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.620]   of what we would need to do.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:27.980]   So, you know, is that going to be feasible?
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:31.460]   I very much doubt it.
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.380]   And therefore, I actually doubt that we can reach
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:37.440]   a level of energy,
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:42.980]   of fossil energy use that is 1%
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.180]   of the current use in the West
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.380]   without totally dramatic changes,
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.060]   either in, you know, our society,
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:52.540]   our use of energy and so forth,
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.860]   which actually, of course,
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:56.580]   much of that energy is used for producing food
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.520]   and so on and so forth.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.060]   So it's actually not so obvious
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:02.980]   that we can cut down our energy usage by that factor.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:06.820]   Or we've got to reduce the human population.
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:07.780]   - Population.
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:09.060]   So you run up against that number.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.500]   That's increasing still.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.140]   And you don't think that could be--
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.220]   - Sorry if that's depressing.
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.780]   - No, it's not depressing.
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:22.460]   It's difficult, like many truths are.
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:25.940]   Do you have a hope
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.380]   that there could be a technological solution?
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.620]   - In short, no.
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:35.660]   There is no technological solution to, for example,
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:37.180]   for population control.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.900]   I mean, we have the technology
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.780]   just to prevent ourselves bearing children.
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:42.780]   That's not a problem.
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:44.300]   Technology's in, okay?
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:45.140]   Solved.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.980]   The challenge is society.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:51.020]   The challenge is human choices.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:55.140]   The challenge is almost entirely human and sociological,
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.940]   not technology.
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:59.900]   And when people talk about energy,
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.060]   they think that there's some kind
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.140]   of technological magic bullet for this,
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.940]   but there isn't, okay?
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:08.140]   And there isn't for the reasons I just mentioned.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.620]   Not because it's obvious there isn't,
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.500]   but actually there isn't.
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.580]   And in any case,
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:17.660]   that it's true of energy, it's true of pollution,
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:19.260]   it's true of human population,
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.940]   it's true of most of the big challenges in our society
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:27.220]   are not scientific or technological challenges.
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:30.580]   They're human sociological challenges.
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:34.980]   And that's why I think it's a terrible mistake,
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.460]   even for folks like me who work at, you know,
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:40.580]   well, the high temple of science and technology
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.740]   in America and maybe in the galaxy.
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:45.780]   I mean, you know, it's--
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:46.620]   - MIT.
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:47.580]   - It's at MIT.
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:48.900]   - Best university in the world.
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.260]   (laughing)
[00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:53.820]   - It's a terrible mistake if we give the impression
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.900]   that technology is going to solve it all.
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:58.700]   Technology will make tremendous contributions.
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.580]   And I think it's worth working on it.
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:04.220]   But it's a disaster if you think
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:05.980]   it's going to solve all of our problems.
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:09.420]   And actually, you know, I've written a whole book
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:13.020]   about the question of scientism
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.060]   and the overemphasis on science,
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:18.740]   both as a way of solving problems through technology,
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.540]   but also as a way of gaining knowledge.
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:23.420]   I think it's not all of the knowledge there is either.
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:27.620]   - Yeah, I think that book and your journey there
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:29.980]   is fascinating, so maybe you can go there.
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:33.660]   Can you tell me about your, on a personal side,
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:36.460]   the personal journey of your faith,
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:38.380]   of Christianity and your relationship
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:42.940]   with God, with religion in general?
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:45.020]   - Yeah, in my latest book,
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.700]   Can a Scientist Believe in Miracles?,
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:50.540]   I devote most of the first chapter
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.340]   to telling how I became a Christian,
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:54.900]   why I became a Christian.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.100]   I didn't grow up as a Christian.
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.300]   - Which is fascinating.
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:50:59.780]   I mean, you didn't grow up as a Christian,
[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:02.820]   so you've discovered the beauty of God
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:04.380]   and physics at the same time.
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:07.620]   - That's a very poetic way of putting it,
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:09.940]   but yes, I would accept that.
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.820]   I became a Christian when I was an undergraduate
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:13.180]   at Cambridge University.
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.580]   I had gone to a school in which there was religion,
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:20.180]   kind of was part of the society.
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:24.900]   There were prayers at the daily gathering
[00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:28.620]   of the students, the assembly of the students,
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:30.460]   but I didn't really believe it.
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.060]   I just sort of went along with it
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:36.580]   and it wasn't particularly aggressive or benign.
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.420]   It just sort of was there, but I didn't believe it.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:42.300]   Didn't make much sense to me,
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.420]   but I came across Christians from time to time.
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.500]   And when I went to Cambridge University,
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:53.580]   two of my closest friends, it turned out, were Christians.
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:56.820]   And I think it was that was the most important influence
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:01.820]   on me, that here were two people who were really smart,
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:09.460]   like me, I'm giving you my impression.
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:10.300]   - The way you felt at the time.
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.100]   - The way I felt at the time.
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:17.740]   And they thought Christianity made sense
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:22.740]   and testified to its significance in their lives.
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:26.340]   And so that was a very important influence on me.
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:29.660]   And ultimately, I mean, the reason,
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:35.580]   I didn't see Christianity as some kind of great evil,
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.140]   the way it's sometimes portrayed
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:39.660]   by the radical atheists of this century.
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.260]   I mean, I think that's nonsense.
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:45.060]   So I think there were certain attractive things.
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.180]   If you go to a university like Cambridge,
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:51.340]   you're surrounded by Western culture
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:54.940]   from about the 15th century onwards,
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:59.140]   and that's saturated with Christian art
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.220]   and architecture and so forth.
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:06.220]   And so it's hard not to recognize that Christianity
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:09.380]   is in fact the foundation of Western society
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:12.620]   and Western culture, Western civilization.
[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:16.340]   So I mean, maybe I was in that sense,
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:20.780]   favorably disposed towards Christianity as a religion,
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.980]   but as a personal faith, it didn't mean anything to me.
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:26.340]   But I became convinced really of two things.
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:30.420]   One is that the evidence for the resurrection
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.900]   of Jesus Christ is actually rather good.
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.900]   I mean, it's not a proof, it's not kind of some kind
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:39.140]   of scientific demonstrate or mathematical demonstration,
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:40.740]   but it's actually extremely good.
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:42.940]   It's not scientific evidence by and large,
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:43.900]   it's historical evidence.
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.900]   - Historical evidence, yeah.
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.100]   - So that was one thing.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:51.260]   And the other thing that came to me when I was at Cambridge,
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:55.420]   it became clear that Christianity ultimately
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:59.420]   is not some kind of moral theory
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:04.380]   or philosophy or something like that.
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:07.040]   It is, or at least it claims to be,
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:10.180]   a personal relationship with God,
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:14.340]   which is made possible by what Jesus did
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:17.540]   on the cross and His life and His teaching.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:21.460]   And it's a personal call to a relationship with God.
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:25.060]   And that, I'd never really thought of it in those terms
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:29.020]   when I was younger, and that thought became
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:31.260]   attractive to me.
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.980]   I mean, I think most people find the person of Christ
[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:38.940]   and His teachings compelling in a certain sense.
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:40.460]   - What do you mean by personal?
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:42.820]   Do you mean personal for you, like a relationship,
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:46.740]   like it's a meditative, like you specifically,
[00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:50.980]   you, Ian, have a connection with God.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:54.180]   And then the other side, you say personal
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.700]   with the actual body, the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:59.260]   So all of those things, what do you mean
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:02.620]   by personal connection and why that was meaningful?
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.180]   - So as a-- - I'm sorry
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:05.780]   for the stupid questions. - No, that's okay,
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:06.680]   no problem.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.980]   As a Christian, I believe that I have a relationship
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.200]   with God, which is best expressed
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.700]   by saying that it's personal.
[00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:19.540]   And that comes about because Jesus, through His acts,
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:24.540]   has reconciled me with God, me, a sinner,
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:30.220]   me, someone full of sins, of failings,
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:34.420]   of ways in which I don't live up to even my own ideals,
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.120]   let alone the ideals of a holy God,
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:41.500]   have been reconciled to the creator of everything.
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:47.220]   And so Christians, myself included,
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:50.060]   believe that prayer is, in a certain sense,
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:51.980]   a connection with God.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.460]   And there are times when I have felt
[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:58.500]   that God spoke to me, I don't mean necessarily orally
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:02.180]   in words, but showed me things or enlightened me
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:07.180]   or inspired me in ways that I attribute to Him.
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:14.100]   So I see it as a two-way relationship in a certain sense.
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:18.060]   Of course, it's a very asymmetrical relationship,
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:21.900]   but nevertheless, Christians think that it's a two-way street.
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.040]   We're not just talking into the air
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.840]   when we say we are going to pray for someone.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.740]   - In this two-way communication,
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:33.980]   is there a way that you could try to describe on a podcast,
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:38.900]   what is God like in your view?
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:44.760]   If you try to describe, is it a force?
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:50.660]   Is it, for you, intellectually, is it a set of metaphors
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:54.300]   that you use to reason about the world?
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:59.300]   Is it kind of a computer that does some computation,
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:03.920]   that's an infinitely powerful computer?
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.680]   Or is it like Santa Claus, a guy with a beard on the cloud?
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:11.780]   Like, I don't mean what God actually is.
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:16.780]   I mean, in your limited cognitive capacity as a human,
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.300]   what do you actually, what do you find helpful
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:21.660]   for thinking of what God actually looks like?
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:23.100]   What is God?
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:26.480]   - Well, let me start by saying none of the above, okay?
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.360]   I mean, clearly God, the Christian God,
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:33.520]   the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, et cetera,
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:37.920]   is not any of those things,
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:40.760]   because all of those things you just mentioned
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:45.760]   are phenomena or entities in the created world.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:50.280]   And the most fundamental thing about monotheism
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:55.280]   as Abraham and Moses and so forth handed it down
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:00.400]   is that God is not an entity within the creation,
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:04.440]   within the universe, that God is the creator of it all.
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.880]   And that's what Genesis, first two chapters of Genesis,
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:07.920]   is really about.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:12.240]   It's not about telling us how God created the world.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.760]   It's about telling us and telling the early Hebrews
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:19.160]   that God created the world, okay?
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.680]   And that therefore he is not simply an entity within it.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:26.160]   On the other hand, our finite minds
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.640]   have a pretty hard time encompassing that.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:33.160]   So one has to therefore work in terms of metaphors
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.840]   and images and so forth.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:40.840]   And I think we would know very little about who God is
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:47.880]   if we were simply left to our own devices.
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:49.880]   If we were just, you know, here you are,
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:51.080]   you're in the universe,
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:54.680]   try to figure out who made it and so forth.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:55.900]   Well, you know, philosophers think
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:57.920]   they can do a little bit of that, maybe,
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:01.120]   and theologians think that they can do a little bit more.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:06.120]   But Christians think that God has actually helped us along
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:09.520]   a lot by revealing himself.
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:14.280]   And we say that he's revealed himself supremely
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.220]   in the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:20.320]   And so, you know, when Jesus says to his disciples,
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.720]   "If you've seen me, you've seen the Father,"
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:26.640]   then that is in a certain sense a watchword
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.200]   for answering this question for Christians.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:31.800]   It is that supremely,
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:36.200]   if we want to help ourselves understand who God really is,
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.240]   we look to Jesus.
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.920]   We look to what he did, we look to what he said,
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.360]   and so forth.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:47.360]   And we believe that he is one with the Father,
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:51.320]   and that's why we believe in the Trinity.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:54.480]   I mean, it's basically because that revelation
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.740]   is extremely central to Christian belief and teaching.
[00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:03.240]   - So in that sense, through Jesus,
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.440]   that's kind of a historical moment that's profound,
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.640]   that's really powerful.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.280]   But do you also think that God makes himself seen
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.200]   in less obvious ways in our world today?
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.960]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:23.680]   I mean, it's certainly been the outlook
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.680]   of Jews and Christians throughout history
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:32.040]   that God is seen in the creation.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.480]   When we look at the creation,
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.160]   we see to some extent the wonder, the majesty,
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.160]   the might of the person, the entity,
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:46.300]   but the person who created it.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:50.280]   And that's a way in which scientists particularly
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.120]   have over the ages,
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.960]   and certainly over most of the last five centuries
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.280]   since the scientific revolution,
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.960]   scientists have seen in a certain sense
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.840]   the hand of God in creation.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:09.440]   I mean, this leads us perhaps to a different discussion,
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.200]   but I mean, it's remarkable to me
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:17.080]   how influential Christianity and religion in generally
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.880]   has been in science.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:21.880]   - Yeah, most of the scientists through history,
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.800]   as you described, I mean,
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.560]   God has been a very big part of their life
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.400]   and their work and their thinking.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.960]   - Yeah, certainly up until the beginning
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.720]   of the 20th century, that was the case.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.320]   - So maybe this is a good time to,
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.560]   can you tell me what scientism is?
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:40.040]   - Yeah, I mean, the short answer is that by scientism,
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.440]   we mean the belief that science
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.360]   is all the real knowledge there is.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.000]   And that's a shorthand.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.800]   There are lots of different facets of it
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.360]   and which one can explore.
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:56.360]   And the book in which I explored it most thoroughly
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.800]   was actually an earlier book called "Monopolizing Knowledge."
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.560]   And the purpose of that title is to draw attention
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.600]   to the fact that in our society as a whole,
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.040]   particularly in the West today,
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.480]   we have grown so reliant on science
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.920]   that we tend to put aside other ways
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.720]   of getting to know things.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:26.160]   And so, of course, at MIT, we are focused on science
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.760]   and we do focus on it very much.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.760]   But the truth is that there are many ways
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.640]   of getting to know things in our world,
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.320]   know things reliably in our world,
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.800]   and a lot of them are not science.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.120]   So scientism, in my view, is a terrible intellectual error.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.360]   It's the belief that somehow the methods of science
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.240]   as we've developed them with experiments
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.000]   and in the end, it relies particularly
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.400]   upon reproducibility in the world
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:01.080]   and on a kind of clarity that comes from measurements
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:06.040]   and mathematics and related types of skills.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.960]   Those powerful though they are
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:11.640]   for finding out about the world
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.560]   are not all the knowledge,
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.320]   do not give us all the knowledge we have,
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.840]   and there's many other forms of knowledge.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.960]   And the illustration that I usually use
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.600]   to try to help people to think about this
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.840]   is to say, "Well, look, let's think about human history."
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.720]   I mean, to what extent can human history
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.120]   be discovered scientifically?
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.240]   The answer is essentially it can't.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.880]   And the reason is because human history is not reproducible.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.040]   You can't do reproducible experiments or observations
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.520]   and go back and try it over again.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.160]   It's a one-off thing.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.760]   History is full of unique events.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:54.320]   And so you can't hope to do history
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.280]   using the methods of science.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.960]   - Yeah, I mean, in some sense,
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.920]   history is a story of miracles.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.640]   I mean, they don't have to do with God.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.400]   It's just one- - Their uniqueness is anyway.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.480]   Unique events, that's for sure.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.320]   - Unique events.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.720]   And that science doesn't like that
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.920]   because it's unique events by their very definition
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.480]   are not reproducible.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.680]   Can I ask sort of a tricky question?
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:21.200]   I don't even know what atheist or atheism is,
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.920]   but is it possible for somebody to be an atheist
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:28.640]   and avoid slipping into scientism?
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.480]   - Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.580]   I mean, these are two separate things, okay?
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:37.240]   I'm quite sure there are many people
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.640]   who don't believe in God and yet recognize
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.120]   that there are many different ways that we get knowledge.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:47.840]   Some is history, some is sociology, economics, politics,
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:52.400]   philosophy, art history, language,
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.240]   literature, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.200]   There are many people who recognize those disciplines
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.360]   as having their own approaches to epistemology
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.720]   and to how we get knowledge and valuing them very highly.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.720]   I don't mean to say that everyone who's an atheist
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:14.600]   automatically subscribes to a scientistic viewpoint.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.040]   That's not true.
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:20.400]   But it's certainly the case that many of the arguments,
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.680]   in fact, most of the arguments of the aggressive atheists
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:28.760]   of this century, people are sometimes called new atheists,
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.420]   although they're actually rather old,
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.360]   most of their arguments are rather old,
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:36.700]   are drawing heavily on scientism.
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.920]   So when they say things like,
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.120]   there's no evidence to support Christianity, okay?
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:48.080]   What they are really focusing on is saying
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.520]   that Christianity isn't proved
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:53.600]   or the evidence for Christianity is not science, okay?
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.140]   Science doesn't prove it.
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:59.120]   And if you read their books,
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.880]   that's what you find they really mean,
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:05.800]   is science doesn't lead you necessarily to believe
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.920]   in a creator God or into any particular religion.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.480]   I accept that, that's not a problem to me,
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.000]   because I don't think that science
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.840]   is all the knowledge there is,
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.400]   and I think there are other important ways
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.120]   of getting to know things,
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.120]   and one of them is historical, for example,
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.480]   and I mentioned earlier that I became persuaded,
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.960]   and I still am persuaded,
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.600]   that the historical evidence for the resurrection
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.780]   is very persuasive.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:35.200]   Again, it's not proof or anything like that,
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.440]   but it's pretty good evidence, okay?
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.840]   - Yeah, I've talked to Richard Dawkins on this podcast,
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:46.280]   and I saw you debate with Sean Carroll,
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:51.280]   so I understand this world, it makes me very curious.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.400]   Maybe, let me ask sort of another way,
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:58.280]   my own kind of worldview, maybe you can help,
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.300]   as by way of therapy, understand.
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:05.560]   You know, 'cause you've kind of said
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.440]   that there's other ways of knowing.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:11.540]   What about if I kind of sit here
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.800]   and am cognizant of the fact
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.040]   that I almost don't know anything?
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:21.200]   I'm sitting here almost paralyzed by the mystery of it all,
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:23.200]   and it's not even, when you say
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.760]   there's other ways of knowing,
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:28.880]   it feels almost too confident to me,
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:33.880]   because yeah, when I listen to beautiful music or see art,
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:39.080]   there's something there that's beyond the reach
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.480]   of scientism, I would say.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:45.340]   So, beyond the reach of the tools of science.
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:48.820]   But I don't even feel like that could be
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:50.920]   as an actual tool of knowing.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:55.220]   I just don't even know where to begin,
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.100]   because it just feels like we know so little.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:00.880]   Like if we look even 100 years from now,
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.300]   when people look back to this time,
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.480]   humans look back to this time,
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.580]   they'll probably laugh at how little we knew,
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:07.900]   even 100 years from now.
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:09.980]   And if we look at 1,000 years from now,
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:12.100]   hopefully we're still alive or some version of ourselves,
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:14.620]   or AI versions of ourselves are still alive.
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:16.940]   (Lex laughing)
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:18.820]   You know, they'll certainly laugh
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:21.060]   at the absurdity of our beliefs.
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:22.280]   So, what do you,
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:26.500]   so you don't seem to be as paralyzed
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.180]   by how little we know.
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:30.440]   You confidently push on forward,
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.780]   but what do you make of that sense of just not knowing
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:35.900]   of the mystery of it all? - First of all,
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:40.900]   we need to be modest or humble,
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:43.420]   even, about what we know.
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:46.060]   I accept that, and I certainly think that's true.
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:50.300]   Not simply because in the future we'll know more science
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:53.940]   and there will be more powerful ways
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:55.700]   of finding out about things,
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:59.540]   but simply because sometimes we're not right.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.760]   We're wrong, okay, in what we think we know.
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:09.940]   So, that's crucial, but it's also a very Christian outlook.
[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:14.460]   That kind of humility is what Jesus taught.
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:18.100]   So, I don't know whether this was in the back of your mind
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.040]   when you were thinking about this,
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:24.040]   but it's often the case that people of religious faith
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.980]   are accused of being dogmatists, okay?
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:29.380]   And there is a sense in which dogma, teaching,
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:34.060]   accepted teaching, is part of religions, okay?
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.460]   But I don't think that necessarily
[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:41.980]   that leads one to blind dogmatism.
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:43.940]   And I certainly don't think that faith,
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.020]   we can talk about this later if you'd like,
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:49.980]   but I certainly don't think that faith means
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:51.400]   thinking you know something
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:54.540]   and not listening to counter-arguments, for example.
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:58.180]   So, I think that's crucial.
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:01.020]   - Yeah, what does faith mean to you?
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.020]   What does it feel like?
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:06.540]   What is it actually, sort of, how do you carry your faith
[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:09.140]   in terms of the way you see the world?
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:12.900]   - Well, I think faith is very often misunderstood
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:15.420]   in our society at the moment,
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:20.220]   because it's often portrayed as being nothing
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:25.220]   other than believing things you know ain't true, you know?
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:32.200]   Or believing things that are not proven, okay?
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:38.200]   And this, and faith does have a strand,
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.080]   which is to do with, you know,
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:45.080]   basically believing in concepts or propositions.
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:50.280]   But actually, the word faith is much broader than that.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:55.280]   Faith also means, you know, trusting in something,
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:00.700]   trusting in a person, or trusting in a thing,
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:04.560]   the reliability of some technology, for example.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.600]   That's equally part of the meaning of the word faith.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.480]   And there's a third strand
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.720]   to the meaning of the word as well,
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:13.520]   and that is loyalty.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.520]   So, you know, I have faith in my wife,
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:21.160]   and I try to act in faith towards her,
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.320]   and that's a kind of loyalty.
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.920]   And so, those three strands
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:28.260]   are the most important strands of the meaning of faith.
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.840]   Yes, belief in propositions
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.000]   that we might not have, you know, full proof about,
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.080]   or maybe we have very little proof about,
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:41.880]   but it's also trust and loyalty.
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.500]   And actually, in terms of the Christian faith,
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:49.640]   Christians are far more called to trust and loyalty
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.160]   than they are to belief in things
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.540]   they don't have proof of, okay?
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:58.020]   But the critics of religion generally
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.060]   tend to emphasize the first one and say,
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:02.460]   "Well, you know, you believe things
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:03.920]   "for which you have no evidence, okay?
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.100]   "That's what they think faith is."
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:08.540]   Well, yeah, there is a sense
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:12.140]   in which everybody has to live their lives
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:19.020]   believing or making decisions in situations
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:24.320]   when they don't have all the proof, or evidence,
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.840]   or knowledge that enables you to make a completely
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:32.300]   rational, or well-informed, or prudent decision.
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:34.860]   We do this all the time.
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:37.540]   My drive down here, I nearly took a wrong turning,
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:39.620]   and I thought, "Which way do I go?
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:41.340]   "Do I keep going straight on?"
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:45.360]   And so, my voice came out, and I think,
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.860]   "Go straight, okay?"
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:50.140]   (both laughing)
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:52.680]   So, you have to make decisions,
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.860]   and sometimes, you don't have a navigation system
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:56.820]   telling you what to do.
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:58.260]   You just have to make that decision
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.580]   with insufficient evidence,
[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:03.100]   and you're doing it all the time as a human,
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:05.440]   and that's part of being sentient.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:10.300]   And so, that kind of action and belief
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.460]   on the basis of incomplete evidence
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:15.420]   is not something that I feel uncomfortable doing,
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:19.340]   or that I feel that somehow my Christian commitments
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:21.420]   have forced me to do when I wouldn't have had
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:22.480]   to have done it otherwise.
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.140]   I would have had to do it anyway.
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:28.860]   And so, there's a sense in which I think it's important
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:31.220]   to see the breadth of meaning of faith,
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:35.220]   and to recognize that, certainly in the case of Christianity,
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:39.280]   it's trust and loyalty that are the key themes
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.660]   that we're called to.
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:45.060]   - And, I mean, another interesting extension of that
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:48.380]   that you speak to is kind of loyalty
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.300]   is referring to a connection
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.340]   with something outside of yourself.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:53.340]   - Yeah.
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:56.280]   - So, I think you've spoken about existentialism,
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.880]   or even just atheism in general,
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:01.940]   as leading naturally to an individualism,
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:04.140]   as a focus on the self,
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:08.080]   and ideas that maybe the Christian faith
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:12.160]   that can instill in you is allowing you
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.560]   to sort of look outside of yourself.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.400]   So, connection, I mean, loyalty fundamentally
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.400]   is about other beings, and yeah, other beings.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.720]   I mean, I think, I don't know what it is in me,
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.300]   but I'm very much drawn to that idea,
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:31.260]   and I think humans in general are drawn to that idea.
[01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:33.740]   You can make all kinds of evolutionary arguments,
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:34.600]   all that kind of stuff,
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:38.040]   but people always kind of tease me
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.840]   'cause I talk about love a lot. (laughs)
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:44.140]   And, I mean, there's a lot of non-scientific things
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:44.980]   about love, right?
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.520]   Like, what the heck is that thing?
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.660]   Why do we even need that thing?
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:50.760]   It seems to be an annoying burden
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:54.240]   that we get so much joy in life
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.780]   from a connection with other human beings,
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:59.240]   deep, lasting connections with human beings.
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:00.560]   Same thing with loyalty.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.800]   Why do we get so much value and pleasure
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:06.440]   and strength and meaning from loyalty,
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.440]   from a connection with somebody else,
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.080]   going through thick and thin with somebody else,
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.200]   going through some hard times?
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:15.260]   I mean, some of the closest friends I have
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:18.760]   is going through some rough times together,
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.320]   and that seems to make life deeply meaningful.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.360]   What is that?
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:29.720]   - Yeah, that resonates with me,
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:32.020]   and obviously I would affirm it.
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:38.160]   I think, just to correct an implication that you made,
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:43.160]   I don't think it's necessarily the consequence of atheism
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:48.520]   that we lose track of those kinds of things.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:51.480]   I mean, I think that atheists can be loyal, okay,
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.320]   if you like.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:56.800]   The question more often comes up in the context
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.760]   of where does morality come from?
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:04.760]   And loyalty, I think, and duty are related to one another.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.400]   If we have loyalty to someone,
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.760]   then we have a duty to them as well.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.400]   And I think that insofar as we see ourselves
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:17.400]   as having any kinds of duties or moral compulsions
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:20.600]   with respect to our relationships to other people,
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:24.060]   I think it's a question that always arises,
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:26.580]   well, where do these come from?
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:29.700]   And there are various approaches that people have
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:34.700]   towards deciding what makes ethics or morality moral, okay.
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:42.100]   But I do think it's the case that it's very hard
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:48.020]   to ground morality in any kind of absolute way
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:54.900]   or persuasive way in mere human relationships.
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:59.540]   And so it's certainly the case that in Christianity,
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:05.660]   there is a sense in which morality and, you know,
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:12.060]   the morality of morals comes from a transcendent place,
[01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:15.180]   from a transcendent deity,
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:20.180]   and that we ground the compelling force of morals on God
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:28.420]   more than we do on individuals.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:29.780]   Because after all, you know,
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:34.620]   if you've got nothing but, you know, other people,
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:39.100]   why should you, you know, treat your neighbor well?
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:41.620]   Why shouldn't you defraud your neighbor
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.380]   if it's good for you?
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:45.980]   Well, you know, you can construct all kinds of arguments,
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:47.020]   and some of them are, you know,
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:50.420]   obviously arguments that are commonplace in religion too.
[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.380]   You should do as you would be done by
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:53.940]   and all this kind of thing.
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:57.420]   But none of that seems any more than mere pragmatism
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:59.180]   to most people, okay.
[01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:03.220]   And so that's one of the things that Nietzsche,
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.920]   amongst others, you know, really identified.
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.300]   If God is dead, if the idea of God
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:10.700]   as grounding our moral behavior
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:12.940]   is no longer viable in the West,
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:15.820]   which Nietzsche thought that it wasn't, okay,
[01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:17.460]   then what does ground it?
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:19.900]   And he had no good answer for it.
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:21.660]   In fact, he claimed there was no answer,
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:23.620]   but then he couldn't live with that.
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:27.900]   And so he invented the idea of the Ubermensch,
[01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:31.740]   you know, this superior human being, okay.
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:36.500]   And this was a different way of trying to ground morality,
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.100]   not a very successful one.
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:40.900]   You know, you could argue that it's a forerunner
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:45.900]   of the sort of racism of Hitler's regime and so forth
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:50.180]   that, you know, we've in the West,
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:53.900]   thankfully shied away from in the past
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:57.280]   half or three quarters of a century.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:01.220]   But, you know, I think it is the case
[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:06.220]   that Christianity gives me a basis
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:11.460]   for my moral beliefs that is more than mere pragmatism.
[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:16.740]   - Yeah, but there is, so stepping outside of all that,
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:20.260]   there does seem to be a powerful stabilizing,
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:23.500]   like we humans are able to hold ideas together,
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.460]   like in a distributed way,
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:29.660]   outside of whether God exists or not or any of that,
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:32.300]   just our ability to kind of converge together
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:36.780]   towards a set of beliefs into sometimes into tribes.
[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:39.660]   It's kind of, I don't know if it's inherent
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:41.500]   to being human beings.
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.820]   I hope not because now if I look on Twitter
[01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:48.500]   and there's the red team and the blue team, right?
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:49.340]   (Luke laughs)
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:52.740]   It's almost like it's some kind of TV show
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:55.940]   that we're living in that people get into these tribes
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:58.920]   and they hold a set of beliefs that sometimes don't,
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.780]   I mean, they are beliefs for the sake
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:03.860]   of holding those beliefs.
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:07.100]   And we get this intimate connection between each other
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:08.780]   for sharing those beliefs.
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:12.920]   And we spoke to the things about loyalty and love,
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:16.020]   and that's the thing that people feel inside the tribe.
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:19.500]   And it seems very human that within that tribe,
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.180]   those beliefs don't necessarily always have
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:24.240]   to be connected to anything.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.860]   It's just the fact that, you know,
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:29.180]   I've did sports my whole life.
[01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:31.500]   Whenever you're on a team, the bond you get
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:34.180]   with other people on the team is incredible.
[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:38.800]   And the actual sport is often the silliest.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:41.280]   I mean, I don't play ball sports anymore,
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.580]   but the ball, when I played like soccer or tennis,
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:45.980]   I mean, all those sports are silly, right?
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:48.060]   You're playing with a little ball,
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.100]   but there's the bond you get is so deeply meaningful.
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:53.340]   So I just, it's interesting to me
[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:57.760]   on a sociological level that it's possible to me,
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:00.280]   whatever the beliefs of religion is,
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:04.340]   whatever they're actually grounded in,
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:08.780]   they might be, they might have a power in themselves.
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:11.660]   - I think there is tribalism everywhere.
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:14.300]   And I think tribalism in the US at the moment
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:17.680]   is rather difficult to bear from my point of view.
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:21.380]   And it's, I think, fed by the internet
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:22.880]   and social media and so forth.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:27.620]   But historically, tribalism has been a trait
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:30.160]   and remains a trait in humans.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:35.160]   The genius of Christianity is that it supersedes tribalism.
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:41.300]   I mean, yes, when the Hebrews thought about Yahweh,
[01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:48.460]   initially they thought about him as their tribal deity,
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:52.100]   just like the tribal deities round about them.
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:57.900]   And so, but, and yet from early on in Hebrew history,
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:03.860]   the crucial thing that Yahweh came to mean,
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:08.860]   or I would say revealed of himself to them,
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:11.740]   was that he wasn't just a tribal deity.
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:15.260]   He was the God that created the whole thing.
[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:17.260]   And if he is the God of the whole thing,
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:20.660]   then he's not just the God of the Hebrews,
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:24.620]   or in the case of Americans,
[01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:26.700]   God is not just the God of Americans,
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.060]   he's the God of everybody.
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:31.780]   And that is a way, in a way,
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:36.780]   the most amazing transcending of tribal loyalties.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:43.860]   And one of the crucial occasions in the New Testament,
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:47.860]   when the Holy Spirit comes at Pentecost,
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:54.180]   the apostles and the disciples speak in other tongues,
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:58.020]   and there are people from all the countries round about,
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:00.240]   hear them in their own languages.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:05.100]   And so, whether you take that as factual or not,
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:10.100]   that is a statement of the transcendent aspects
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:14.460]   of Christianity, or the claimed transcendent aspects
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:17.220]   of Christianity, that it transcends culture.
[01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:20.220]   And that's certainly something which I find appealing.
[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:25.220]   - When I kind of touch on this topic in my own mind,
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.880]   one of the hardest questions is,
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:31.780]   why is there suffering in the world?
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:33.700]   Do you have a good answer?
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:37.460]   - Well, I have some answers, but you're right,
[01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:39.820]   that it is one of the toughest questions.
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:43.100]   The problem of pain, or the problem of suffering,
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:47.540]   or the problem of theodicy, as theologians call it,
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:49.860]   is probably one of the toughest.
[01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:54.380]   I think it's important to say that there are
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:57.160]   certain types of answers to this question,
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:59.100]   but there are aspects of this question
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:02.180]   to which there is no intellectual answer
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:03.740]   that is going to satisfy.
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:07.560]   And the fact of the matter is,
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:11.100]   when I'm speaking to an audience,
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:15.580]   let's say at some kind of lecture,
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:20.140]   I can be sure that there are people in that audience
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:22.020]   who are either personally suffering,
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:24.180]   they've got illness, they've got pains,
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:25.700]   maybe they're facing death,
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:28.940]   or someone in their family is in similar sorts of situations.
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:32.800]   So suffering is a reality, and there is nothing
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:37.220]   that I can say that is gonna solve their feeling
[01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:42.220]   of agony and angst and maybe despair
[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:44.900]   in those types of situations.
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:48.780]   There is really only one thing that I think humans can do
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:52.380]   for one another in those kinds of situations,
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:54.520]   and that is simply to be there,
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:59.520]   to be there alongside your friend or your colleague
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:03.800]   or whoever, family member or whoever it might be.
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:07.300]   And that's the only really sense
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.780]   in which we can give comfort.
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:13.780]   If we try to give intellectual solutions to these problems,
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:16.740]   we're going to be like the comforters
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:20.460]   that were in the book of Job in the Bible,
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:23.900]   who brought no comfort to Job himself
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:27.620]   with their intellectual answers.
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:30.220]   But if they had been there, and some of them were there,
[01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:34.480]   they sat alongside, that is some level of comfort.
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:39.100]   And after all, that's the meaning of the word compassion.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:42.820]   It means to suffer alongside of somebody.
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:45.180]   And I would say, first off,
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:47.540]   what does a Christian say about suffering?
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:51.400]   The first thing a Christian should say is,
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:54.020]   compassion is all that really counts.
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:58.360]   And what's more, we say that God has acted
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:01.500]   in compassion towards us.
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:04.720]   That is to say, He has suffered with us
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.600]   in the person of Jesus Christ.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.360]   And when we see the passion of Jesus,
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:14.360]   we recognize that God takes suffering deadly seriously,
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:18.480]   has taken it so seriously that He's been willing to come
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:23.360]   and be a part of His creation in the person of Jesus Christ
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:27.640]   and suffer death, the most horrible death on the cross,
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:30.080]   for our benefit.
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:32.560]   So that's one side of suffering.
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:37.560]   But the philosophical question remains,
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:42.680]   surely if God is good and God is omnipotent, benevolent,
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:47.820]   why doesn't He take away all the suffering?
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:50.580]   Why doesn't He cause miracles to occur
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:53.180]   that will take away all the suffering?
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:56.220]   I think there are some good answers to that question
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.740]   in the following sense,
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:03.740]   that we live in a world where the consistency of the world
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:11.140]   is an absolutely crucial part of it.
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:16.140]   The fact that our world behaves reproducibly in the main
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:21.260]   is absolutely essential for the integrity of our lives.
[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:23.460]   Without it, we wouldn't exist.
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:28.700]   And so there is a sense in which the integrity of creation
[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:31.780]   calls for there being consistent behavior,
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:35.680]   which these days we think of as being the laws of nature.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:39.840]   And so the consistent behavior of nature
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:41.220]   is very, very important.
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:43.760]   It's what enables us to be what we are.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:50.020]   And if you're calling upon God in your critique
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:54.420]   of why isn't this benevolent creator fixing things,
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:59.640]   one answer is He's fixed things in a certain sense
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:02.840]   to have an integrity in them.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:07.520]   And that integrity is the best thing.
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:10.080]   It's the way we have our existence.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:12.840]   It's the way we live and move and have our being.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:15.460]   And if you want something different,
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:18.880]   you've got to show that there is a way
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:22.480]   in which you could invent a world that is better,
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:25.800]   that it has the integrity that we need to exist, okay,
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:30.620]   and to be able to think and love and be,
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:33.620]   but you are gonna do it better.
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:36.240]   And the atheists think that maybe
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.880]   they have got a better idea,
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:40.080]   but if they thought about it a bit more carefully,
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:43.960]   they'd realize no one has put forward a better idea, okay?
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.380]   - So another way to say that,
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:51.560]   I mean, is that suffering is an integral part of this
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:57.360]   of a consistent existence.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:02.360]   So sort of in a philosophical sense,
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:08.120]   the full richness and the beauty of our experience
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.960]   would not be as beautiful, would not be as rich
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:14.400]   if there was no suffering in the world.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:15.920]   Is that possible?
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.440]   - Well, I think you said two different things
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:20.360]   that aren't exactly, at least that aren't exactly the same.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:25.280]   One is that suffering is an integral part of our experience.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:28.720]   You know, that might be considered a challenge
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.500]   to certain types of Christian theology
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.720]   or even Jewish theology.
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:36.720]   In other words, Christians talk about the fall
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:40.400]   and talk about Adam and Eve in the garden
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:45.320]   and have a vision of there being some kind of perception
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:49.240]   from or perfection from which we have fallen.
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.680]   And I think there is a perfection from which we've fallen,
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:53.120]   but I don't think that perfection
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:56.920]   is some kind of physical perfection.
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:59.600]   In other words, I don't subscribe personally to the view
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.840]   that some Christians do,
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:05.980]   that there was some state prior to the fall
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:08.740]   in which death did not occur.
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:11.080]   I don't think that that's consistent with science
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:12.160]   as we know it.
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:16.440]   And I think that death, for example,
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:19.680]   has been part of the biological world
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:24.680]   and the universe as a whole from billions of years ago.
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.640]   So just to be clear about that,
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:31.760]   on the other hand, I do think,
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.880]   so if that's the case,
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.800]   then certainly in that sense, at the very least,
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:40.440]   suffering or at least death, okay,
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:45.280]   is part of the biological existence.
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:48.160]   And that probably seems so completely obvious
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:51.760]   to somebody who is au fait with science,
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:54.600]   whether they're a scientist or not.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.080]   - Well, and I apologize if I'm interrupting,
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:01.280]   but it's the obvious reality of our life today,
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.400]   but there's a lot of people,
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.480]   I think it's currently in vogue,
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.200]   I've talked to quite a few folks
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:09.920]   who kind of see as the goal of many of our pursuits
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:12.240]   as to extend life indefinitely,
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:16.020]   a sort of a dream for many people is to live forever.
[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:19.920]   But in the technological world,
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:21.880]   in the engineering world, in the scientific world,
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.760]   I mean, that's the big dream.
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:28.760]   To me, it feels like that's not a dream.
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:32.200]   I certainly would like to live forever,
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:35.500]   like that's the initial feeling, the instinctual feeling,
[01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:37.960]   'cause life is so amazing.
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.680]   But then if you actually,
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:41.360]   kind of like you've presented it,
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:44.720]   if you actually live that kind of life,
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:47.840]   you would realize that that's actually a step backwards,
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.360]   that's a step down from the experience of this life.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:54.440]   In my sense, that death is an essential part of life,
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:57.560]   about, essential part of this experience,
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:58.640]   death of all things.
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:02.320]   So the fact that things end somehow,
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:07.920]   and the scarcity of things somehow create the beauty
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.020]   of this experience that we have.
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:12.800]   - Yeah, transhumanism doesn't look
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:14.920]   very attractive to me either,
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:17.060]   but it also doesn't look very feasible.
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:21.240]   But that's a whole big topic
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:23.840]   that I'm not exactly an expert,
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:26.000]   but I'll say, but I, but, you know,
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.160]   I'm of a certain age where my mortality is more pressing
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:32.880]   or more obvious to me than it once was, okay?
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:38.720]   And I don't dread that.
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:43.100]   I don't see that as, in a certain sense,
[01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:44.960]   even the enemy, okay?
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.240]   - You're not afraid of death?
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:50.640]   - Well, I'm afraid of lots of things in a conceptual way,
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:53.240]   but it doesn't keep me awake at night, okay?
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:57.460]   I think like most people,
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:00.740]   I'm more afraid of pain than I am of death.
[01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:02.520]   So I don't want to put myself forward
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:05.760]   as some kind of hero that doesn't worry about these things.
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.200]   That's not true.
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:10.400]   But I do think, and maybe this is part
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:13.680]   of my Christian outlook,
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:16.420]   that there is life beyond the grave,
[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:22.280]   but I don't think that it's life in this universe
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:26.440]   or in this, certainly not in this body,
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.680]   and maybe not in a certain sense in this mind.
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:31.560]   I mean, you know, Christian belief in the afterlife
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:33.880]   is that we will be resurrected,
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.740]   we will be, in a certain sense, be with God.
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:36.820]   I don't know what that means,
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:38.760]   and I don't think anybody else really quite knows
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.760]   what that means, but there are lots of ways
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:43.280]   that over history, people, artists,
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:47.320]   and writers and so forth have pictured it,
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.000]   and these are all perhaps, some of them,
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.520]   helpful ways of thinking about it.
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.200]   - Do you think it's possible to know
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:53.660]   what happens after we die?
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:58.840]   - I don't think we find out by near-death experiences
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:00.080]   or those kinds of things,
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:05.080]   but I think that, you know, that we have sufficient.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.700]   I feel I have sufficient information, if you like,
[01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:13.760]   in terms of God's revelation to be confident
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:17.860]   that I will go somewhere else, okay?
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:22.100]   But it won't be here, and I, to me,
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:27.100]   the aspirations of transhumanism are horrific.
[01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:31.580]   I mean, I think it would be a nightmare,
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:34.020]   not a dream, a nightmare, you know,
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:37.660]   to be somehow downloaded into a computer
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:40.020]   and live one's life like that,
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:44.980]   because it completely discounts the integrity
[01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:46.900]   of our bodies as well as our minds.
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:51.180]   I mean, we aren't just disembodied minds.
[01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:55.540]   It would not be me that was in the computer.
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:57.180]   It would be something else
[01:34:57.180 --> 01:34:59.940]   if that kind of download were possible.
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:01.100]   Of course, it isn't possible,
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:03.540]   and it's a very long way from being possible,
[01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:05.220]   but, you know, amazing things happen,
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:07.460]   so we shouldn't be too certain.
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:09.580]   - So this is a place that, again,
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:12.100]   maybe taking a slight step outside
[01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:15.500]   wherever philosophizing a little bit,
[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:19.420]   let me ask you about human-level
[01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:21.660]   or superhuman-level intelligence,
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:23.920]   the artificial intelligence systems.
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:30.340]   What do you make from almost a religious,
[01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:32.980]   or a perspective that we've been talking about
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:36.520]   of the special aspect of human nature,
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.820]   of us creating intelligence systems
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:43.540]   that exhibit some elements of that human nature?
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:45.020]   Is that something, again,
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.540]   like we were talking about with transhumanism,
[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:49.020]   there's a feasibility question
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:50.860]   of how hard is it to actually build machines
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:52.280]   that are human-level intelligence,
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.280]   or have something like consciousness,
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:56.740]   or have all those kinds of human qualities,
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:01.740]   and then there's the do we want to do that kind of thing?
[01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:05.380]   So on both of those directions, what do you think?
[01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:07.060]   - Well, okay, so, you know,
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:08.820]   since your podcast is called AI,
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:12.380]   I don't want to offend too many of your listeners out there,
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:16.180]   but I think one should be a little bit more modest
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:18.020]   about one's claims for AI
[01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:20.300]   than have typically been the case.
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:22.580]   I think that actually a lot of people in AI
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:23.820]   are somewhat chastened,
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:26.300]   and so there are more modest claims
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:30.580]   than are common with the transhumanists and so forth.
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:36.420]   And, you know, I used to play chess when I was a kid.
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:38.700]   I was pretty good at it, okay?
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:41.620]   I won competitions and so on and so forth.
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:43.820]   And I, when I, and I'm talking about
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:44.740]   when I was in high school,
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:47.140]   I thought it was pretty unlikely
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:50.740]   that a computer would be able to become good at chess,
[01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:52.260]   but I was dead wrong, okay?
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:53.900]   And so, you know.
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:55.140]   - How did that make you feel, by the way,
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:57.420]   when you blew a big chess barrel?
[01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:00.380]   - I stopped playing chess seriously
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:04.140]   when I encountered computers that could beat me, okay?
[01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:05.500]   (both laughing)
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:07.580]   I still play with my grandchildren a little bit,
[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:11.660]   but yeah, it seemed like, in a certain sense,
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:13.740]   it became a solved problem
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:17.100]   when AI was able to do it better than I could.
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:20.020]   So I think that there are ways in which today
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:23.220]   we've seen computers do things
[01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:25.140]   which historically were regarded
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:29.580]   as being very characteristic of human intelligence.
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:34.260]   And in that sense, there is some success to AI.
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:36.500]   I also think that, you know,
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:38.940]   there are certain things which one might think of
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:41.420]   as being AI, which are, you know,
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:43.460]   completely widespread in our society.
[01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:48.460]   I'm thinking about the internet search engines and so forth,
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:51.140]   which are enormously influential
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:54.140]   and obviously do things more powerfully
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:56.380]   than any individual human
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:58.900]   or even any combination of humans could do,
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:03.900]   much faster, and accessing databases
[01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:05.420]   and so on and so forth.
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:10.420]   All of this has outstripped our human intelligence.
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:14.020]   I'm not sure the extent, though,
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:16.340]   to which that is really intelligence
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:19.420]   in the way that was traditionally meant,
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:24.020]   but it's certainly amazingly facile,
[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:29.020]   and it multiplies our ability to access human knowledge
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:32.020]   and data and so forth.
[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:33.260]   - So is that something,
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:35.140]   is that into the realm of something
[01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:37.420]   we should be concerned about?
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:39.540]   So in the realm of religion,
[01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:41.700]   you talk about what is good, what is evil,
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:43.060]   what is right, what is wrong.
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:45.820]   You have a set of morals, set of beliefs,
[01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:48.300]   and when you have an entity come into the picture
[01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:51.620]   that has quite a bit of power,
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:53.660]   if we potentially look into the future,
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:56.200]   and intelligence and capability,
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:00.780]   do you think there's something that religion can say
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:03.460]   about artificial intelligence,
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:07.100]   or is that something we shouldn't worry about
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:08.860]   until it arrives, you think,
[01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:10.980]   just like with the chess program?
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:12.380]   - You know, religious writers
[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:14.280]   have thought about this for centuries.
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:17.900]   You know, there's been a long debate
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:22.900]   about what is historically called the plurality of worlds,
[01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:27.220]   and it was actually more about whether there are places
[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:30.700]   where other intelligent creatures live
[01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:33.020]   than it was about us creating them.
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:36.100]   But I think it's largely the same question.
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:38.380]   - It's almost like aliens, like other intelligent.
[01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:41.340]   - So if there is other intelligent life in the universe,
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:43.620]   what is its relationship to God?
[01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:45.420]   Okay, that is, in a certain sense,
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:48.460]   the puzzle that religious thinkers and writers
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:49.820]   have thought about for a long time,
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:52.720]   and there's a whole range of different opinions
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:53.560]   about that.
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:57.060]   I mean, personally, I think it's an interesting question,
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:00.260]   but it's not a very pressing question at the moment.
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:03.500]   And I think the same way about the question
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:05.860]   of what happens if we're able to build
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:08.580]   a sentient robot, for example.
[01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:09.980]   I think it's an interesting question,
[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:12.860]   and we'll have to think about it when that happens,
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:15.020]   but I think we're still quite a ways away from that,
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:17.180]   and so I don't have a good answer.
[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:19.660]   But I think there's a literature
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:22.440]   that one could tap to think about.
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.280]   (Lex laughing)
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.080]   - Do you wanna start early on the question?
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:26.460]   (Lex laughing)
[01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:29.000]   Well, let me ask you another possible question,
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.240]   from a religious or from a personal perspective,
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:33.440]   what do you think is consciousness?
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:38.440]   This subjective experience that we seem to be having.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:43.560]   Does the Christian religion have something
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.160]   to say about consciousness?
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:47.980]   Does your own, when you look in the mirror,
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:50.240]   do you have a sense of what is consciousness?
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:53.560]   - I think the Bible doesn't have much
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:55.840]   in the way of answers about that directly,
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.680]   in the sense that you're perhaps asking it,
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:40:59.560]   which is more like, I think you're asking
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:02.440]   for some kind of quasi-scientific,
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.840]   or maybe indeed scientific description of consciousness.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.640]   - Desperately looking for one, yes.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:11.680]   - I think that there, it's an interesting question.
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:16.680]   I think it's actually, it's a jump too far.
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:19.500]   I think we don't even know the answer to the question,
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:22.100]   what is the mind, let alone consciousness?
[01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:24.460]   So if you distinguish between those two things,
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:26.260]   I think the question that's being addressed
[01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:31.260]   more directly, scientifically, as well as in other ways,
[01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:33.940]   it is what is the mind?
[01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:37.140]   And that is certainly a very topical question,
[01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:40.220]   even in places like MIT, which is not historically involved
[01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:41.700]   with philosophical questions,
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:45.500]   you know, the people doing neuroscience and so forth.
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:48.100]   I think it's a very important question,
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:50.920]   and I think that we're going to find
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:54.700]   that we are not computers.
[01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:59.700]   In other words, I think the commonplace theory
[01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:04.980]   of what mind is, is generally speaking,
[01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:10.080]   by analogy, that we are basically wetware, okay?
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:15.760]   That we're some computer-like entity,
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:20.840]   and that the analogy to digital computers
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:22.840]   is a pretty decent one.
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.840]   I mean, that's of course a viewpoint
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:30.400]   which drives the aspirations of the transhumanists.
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:32.880]   I mean, they so much believe that our minds
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:35.580]   are nothing other than, you know, in a certain sense,
[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:39.200]   some kind of implementation of software in biology
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:40.360]   that they say to themselves,
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.720]   "Well, of course we're going to be able to download it
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:45.640]   "into a digital computer."
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:47.360]   I don't think that's true.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:52.920]   I think it's most likely that quantum mechanics
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:55.260]   is very important in the brain.
[01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:59.880]   It seems most unlikely that it's not, to me.
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:03.360]   I know that that's contrary to the opinions of many people,
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:06.440]   but that's my view, and it's also a view, for example,
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:09.640]   of people like Roger Penrose and people like that
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:13.160]   who've written about it rather extensively.
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:17.080]   And if that's the case, then really my mind
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:22.080]   is not reducible to some kind of software
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:25.160]   which can be considered to be portable.
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:30.160]   It is so connected to the hardware of my body
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:33.240]   that the two are inseparable, okay?
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:35.900]   And so if that is in fact what we find,
[01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:39.040]   as I suspect will be the case,
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:41.040]   then the aspirations of the transhumanists
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:45.280]   will be very long in coming, if at all.
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:48.600]   So I think that actually physics and chemistry
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:56.880]   are in a sense involved with the brain and in the mind,
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:01.800]   but not in a very simple way like the computer analogy,
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:05.360]   in a much more complicated way.
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:11.680]   And I also think that it's philosophically ignorant
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:19.520]   to speak as if when and if the actions of the brain
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:25.600]   are understood at the physical and chemical level,
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:30.600]   that the mind will vanish as a concept,
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:34.360]   that we'll just say, "We're nothing but brains," okay?
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.000]   Of course it won't.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.120]   I mean, it may well be that our mind
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:41.220]   is an emergent phenomenon that comes out
[01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:44.380]   of the physics and chemistry and biology, okay?
[01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:48.320]   But it's also something that we have to encounter
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.880]   and take seriously.
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:54.880]   And so it's not the case that the mind is reducible
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:59.920]   to nothing but physics and chemistry,
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:03.600]   even if it's embedded continuously
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:06.820]   into physics and chemistry, as I rather suspect it is.
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:10.840]   So that's my own view.
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:14.640]   I mean, another way of putting it is that the mind
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:19.000]   or the soul is not something added into humans,
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.360]   as might have been the viewpoint historically.
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:26.280]   I do think there is something added to humans,
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:29.200]   but it's not the mind, it's the spirit.
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:30.880]   And that takes us beyond the physical,
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:32.960]   it takes us beyond this universe.
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:35.760]   But I don't think that consciousness,
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.360]   the mind, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:39.360]   is that thing which is necessarily--
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:40.720]   - It's added in explicitly.
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:42.480]   It could be emergent in some ways.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:45.680]   - I'm not a substance dualist in that sense, okay,
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.920]   if you want to put it philosophically.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:51.640]   - I mean, but your sense is,
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:54.080]   so the mind and the intelligence and consciousness
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:55.720]   could be these emergent things.
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:59.400]   Do you have a hope, a sense that science
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:03.120]   could help us get pretty far down the road
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:05.600]   of understanding-- - Oh, we will get much further
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:09.600]   than we have, and it'll be interesting.
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:16.000]   I mean, right now, our methods of diagnosing the human brain
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000]   are extremely primitive.
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000]   I mean, the resolution that we have,
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:25.920]   that comes out of NMR and brain scans and so forth
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:28.820]   is miserable compared with what we need
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:31.880]   in order to understand the brain at the cellular level,
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:34.080]   let alone at the atomic level.
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:37.480]   But we're making progress.
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:40.120]   It's relatively slow progress, but it's progress,
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:40.960]   and people are working on it,
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:42.280]   and we're going to get better at it,
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:45.380]   and we will find out very interesting things as we do.
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:48.760]   The time resolution is also completely hopeless
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:51.840]   compared with what we need to understand the thought.
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:56.680]   So there's a long way to go, and we will get better at it.
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:01.300]   But I'm not at all worried, as some people are,
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:03.700]   and some people speak as if this is a good thing,
[01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:07.940]   that somehow the concepts of humanity
[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:12.940]   and the mind and religion and consciousness
[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:16.300]   are going to vanish because we're going to have
[01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:20.460]   complete physicochemical description of the brain
[01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:22.240]   in the near future.
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:23.540]   We're not gonna have that.
[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:25.200]   And secondly, even if we had it,
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.500]   the mind and all these other things
[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:28.780]   aren't gonna vanish because of it.
[01:47:28.780 --> 01:47:31.860]   - Well, I find kind of compelling the notion
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:36.700]   that whoever created this universe and us
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:42.500]   did so to understand itself, himself.
[01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:47.500]   I mean, there's a powerful self-reflection notion
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:52.140]   to this whole experiment that we're a part of.
[01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:54.540]   - Well, I certainly think that God takes delight
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:59.060]   in his creation, and that it was created for that delight
[01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:03.260]   as much as it was for any other reason,
[01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:06.160]   and that, you know, that therefore,
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:11.060]   there's reason to be hopeful and awestruck by the creation,
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:14.660]   whether it's on the very small or on the very large.
[01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:15.780]   - I'm not sure if you're familiar,
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:18.940]   there's something called the simulation hypothesis
[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:22.820]   that's been fun to talk about with the computer scientists
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:26.540]   and so on, which is a kind of thought experiment
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:29.680]   that proposes that, you know,
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:31.500]   the entirety of the world around us
[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:33.540]   is a kind of a computer program.
[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:36.580]   That's a simulation, and then we're living inside it.
[01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:40.220]   I think there's, I think from a certain perspective,
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:45.100]   that could be consistent with a religious view of the world.
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:48.180]   I mean, you could just use different terms, basically.
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:55.100]   But it feels like a more modern, updated version of that.
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:49:00.940]   But what's your sense of this,
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:02.300]   of the simulation hypothesis?
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:04.620]   Do you find it interesting, useful to think about it?
[01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:06.140]   Do you find it ridiculous?
[01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:07.300]   Do you find it fun?
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:08.460]   What are your thoughts?
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:11.180]   - It's fun, and it's been, of course,
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:12.980]   the subject of various movies,
[01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:17.140]   that some of which are very well known.
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:22.420]   You know, I don't think it makes sense
[01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:26.380]   to think of it as a simulation hypothesis
[01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:30.940]   in the sense that we're really lying in banks of,
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:39.140]   on banks of beds, having our energy drained away from us,
[01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:42.900]   and the simulation is going on in our individual brains.
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:45.160]   That makes no sense to me at all.
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:46.480]   I don't think that's what's meant
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:49.980]   by the simulation hypothesis as you're using it now.
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:51.380]   But I think that there is a,
[01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:56.100]   there is very little distinction
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:50:00.460]   between saying that an intelligent creator
[01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:05.460]   has set up the universe according to his will and his plan
[01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:12.620]   and set it in motion and is allowing it to run out.
[01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:18.020]   Maybe, as Christians say, he's sustaining it, actually,
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:21.920]   by his word of power, it says in the book,
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:23.580]   the letter to Hebrews, okay,
[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:31.280]   in this amazingly consistent and integrated way.
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:35.040]   I don't think there's very much difference
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:38.120]   between saying that and saying that it's a simulation, okay?
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.400]   I mean, I think it's almost the same thing, okay?
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:45.600]   But I think it's important to recognize that
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:50.000]   the simulation in that concept,
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.240]   the simulation and the creation of the universe
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.720]   are the same thing, okay?
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:57.300]   In other words, it's a simulation
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:51:02.300]   that is billions of light years across, okay?
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:03.320]   - Yeah.
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:07.160]   I mean, there's a sense in which it helps one understand,
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:09.080]   especially if you're not religious,
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:11.280]   that there is something outside of the world
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:14.240]   that we live in, that there's something bigger
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:15.560]   than the world we live in.
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:18.240]   And that, I mean, that's just another perspective
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:21.860]   on that humbles you.
[01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:25.120]   So in that sense, it's a powerful thought experiment.
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:28.120]   - One shortcoming of that is the following,
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:31.240]   is of the analogy, is this,
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:32.800]   that we think of a simulation
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:35.780]   as something taking place in the universe.
[01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:39.680]   It's taking place in my computer, okay?
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:43.000]   I don't think that's the right analogy
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.000]   for a Christian view of creation, okay?
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.320]   I don't think it's taking place
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:55.160]   in some other universe that God has made, okay?
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:59.320]   I think maybe it's taking place in the mind of God.
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:01.680]   Christians might hypothesize also.
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:05.480]   But I think that it's important to recognize
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:07.920]   that Christian theology at any rate
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:11.920]   is that God is not one of the entities in the universe,
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:15.680]   and presumably, therefore, is very different
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:18.320]   from a simulation that we might run on a computer.
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:22.160]   - Let me ask you, Adam and Eve,
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:24.760]   Eve and Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:26.000]   of good and evil.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:27.960]   Does this, is this story meaningful to you?
[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:30.180]   What does this story mean to you?
[01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:32.680]   - Yeah, it is meaningful to me.
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:36.040]   I take the writings of the Bible very seriously,
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:39.000]   and I think that most Christians regard them
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:44.000]   as having some kind of authoritative role in their faith.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.040]   What do I get from it?
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:49.680]   I mean, I think the most important thing
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:52.280]   that Christians get from the story of Adam and Eve
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:54.400]   and eating the apple and so forth
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:59.400]   is that the relationship between humans and God is broken,
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:03.240]   has been broken by man's disobedience.
[01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:05.600]   That's what the story of Adam and Eve
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:07.760]   and the apple is all about.
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:12.760]   And that broken relationship is, for Christians,
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:17.060]   what Jesus came to redeem,
[01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:20.880]   came to overcome that brokenness
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:25.160]   and restore that relationship with God
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:31.240]   to some extent, at any rate, on Earth,
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:36.240]   and ultimately, you know, in eternity, to restore it fully.
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:40.520]   So that's really what Christians mean
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:43.200]   and gain from the story of Adam and Eve.
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:45.500]   Of course, lots of people ask the questions
[01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:50.000]   about how literally should we take these stories
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.840]   of particularly the first few chapters of Genesis,
[01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.320]   which is an important question,
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:59.320]   but we tend to get bogged down with it a bit too much.
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:02.560]   I think we should take away the message.
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:08.920]   And I think what actually we would have seen
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:10.920]   if we'd been there, okay,
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:14.120]   is something which is a matter of speculation,
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:15.920]   and it's certainly not terribly important
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:18.200]   from the point of view of Christian theology.
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:20.400]   - But it seems like a very important moment.
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:26.520]   As a man of faith, do you wish that,
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:28.760]   I think it was Eve first.
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:29.760]   - Yeah, it was Eve.
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:31.320]   (Luke laughs)
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:33.120]   - It wasn't an apple, by the way, it was just a fruit.
[01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:33.960]   - It was a fruit.
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:34.800]   - You said it very carefully.
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:36.640]   - It was the fruit of the tree, right?
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:38.680]   (Luke laughs)
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:42.000]   Do you wish they wouldn't have eaten of the tree?
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.760]   I mean, this is back to our discussion of suffering.
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:47.760]   Was that like an essential thing that needed to happen?
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:52.640]   - You're gonna have to read "Paradise Lost"
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:54.240]   to get your answer to that.
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:56.320]   (both laugh)
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:57.160]   - Beautifully put.
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:01.520]   Okay, well, let me ask the biggest question,
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:03.160]   one that you also touch in your book,
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:06.360]   but one that I ask every once in a while,
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:08.080]   is what is the meaning of life?
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:15.240]   - The meaning of my life is many different things, okay?
[01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:19.800]   But they are all kind of centered around relationships.
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:25.840]   I mean, for a Christian, one's relationship with God
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:30.840]   is a crucial part of the meaning of life,
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:33.560]   but one's relationship with one's family,
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:37.840]   wife, parents, children, grandchildren, in my case,
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:42.400]   and so forth, those are crucially important.
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:45.720]   These are all the places where people,
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:49.000]   whether they're religious or not, find meaning.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:55.480]   But ultimately, I think a person who has faith
[01:55:55.480 --> 01:56:00.480]   in a creator who we think has an intention,
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:08.160]   many intentions, but a will
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:12.160]   in respect of the world as a whole,
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:14.480]   that's a crucial part of meaning.
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:20.360]   And the idea that my life might have some small significance
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:26.360]   in the plan of that creator
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:31.360]   is an amazingly powerful idea that brings meaning.
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:38.720]   I tell a story in my book that when I was a student,
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:41.720]   before I became a Christian, I read a philosophy book
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:45.480]   whose approximate title was "What is the Meaning of Life?"
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:48.160]   And that book basically said,
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:49.360]   "There is no meaning to life.
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:51.880]   "You have to make up the meaning as you go along."
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:56.400]   And I think that's probably the predominant secular view
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:59.280]   is these days, that there is no real meaning,
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:00.640]   but you can make up a meaning,
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:03.000]   and that will give you meaning into your life.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.040]   I don't subscribe to that view anymore.
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:10.280]   I think there is more meaning than that.
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:12.520]   But I do think that those things which give meaning
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:13.840]   to our life are very important,
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:15.400]   and we should emphasize them.
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:20.400]   - And you have said that as the part of that meaning,
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:25.920]   as the part of your faith, love and loyalty are key parts.
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:31.600]   So can you try to say what is love and loyalty?
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:40.400]   What does it mean to you?
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:43.640]   What does it look like?
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:49.240]   If you were to give advice to your children,
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:52.440]   grandchildren of what to look for
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:56.800]   in looking for loyalty and love,
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:58.520]   what would you try to say?
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:01.360]   - Well, I think it's something like
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:06.360]   yielding your will or desire to another.
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:13.320]   It's valuing others more highly,
[01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:16.200]   or at least as highly as yourself.
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:17.600]   But that's just the start of it,
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:21.440]   because true love, you reach a point
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:25.420]   where you feel compelled by the other.
[01:58:25.420 --> 01:58:32.640]   And that, I think to some people, sounds very scary,
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:35.460]   but actually, it's terrifically liberating.
[01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:40.680]   And I think that love then brings you
[01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:45.160]   into service towards another.
[01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:50.120]   And I'm reminded of the phrase
[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:52.560]   from the Anglican prayer book,
[01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:55.440]   where it talks about Jesus,
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:57.640]   whose service is perfect freedom.
[01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:00.280]   In other words, for us Christians,
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:03.800]   to serve God is what perfects our freedom.
[01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:06.360]   And I think there is an amazing love
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:11.640]   is in part captivity,
[01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:16.080]   but in a kind of paradoxical sense,
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:18.640]   it's also an amazing freedom.
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:19.880]   - Love is freedom.
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:22.240]   I don't think there's a better way to end it.
[01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:26.320]   We started with fusion energy and ending on love.
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:27.960]   Ian, it was a huge honor to talk to you.
[01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:29.240]   Thank you so much for your time today.

[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:24.360]   from Arthur C. Clarke.
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:27.000]   "Finally, I would like to assure my many Buddhist,
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.840]   "Christian, Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim friends
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:31.640]   "that I am sincerely happy

[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:39.440]   "And often, as Western medical science now
