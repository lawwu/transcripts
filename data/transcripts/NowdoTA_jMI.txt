[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.980]   - Rebecca emails in to ask a question
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.080]   about church discipline.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.480]   She writes, "In regards to Matthew 18, 15 to 20,
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.680]   "I'm wondering what I as a Christian am responsible
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.480]   "to do biblically when a fellow believer
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.960]   "is living in sexual sin and chooses to continue
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.920]   "after they have been confronted in a loving way."
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.600]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.460]   - The practical answer here really does depend
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.940]   on whether Rebecca and the person she's concerned about
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.040]   maybe a friend who's sleeping with a boyfriend,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.340]   I don't know what her situation is,
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.600]   but let's just say something like that,
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.600]   whether those two people are in a biblically faithful church
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.100]   that is a church that considers the Bible
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.000]   as their standard of faith and practice.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.140]   And if they are, the answer is, or should be,
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.140]   yes, excommunication can and maybe should happen.
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.340]   And of course she's referring to Matthew 18.
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.240]   And it might be helpful just to walk through the steps
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.140]   so that everybody has in view,
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.440]   'cause they're short and they're clear.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.900]   Here's what happens in real relationships
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.380]   in a church from time to time.
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.860]   Step one, if your brother sins against you,
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.140]   go and tell him his fault between you and him alone.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.260]   If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.260]   So step one, you find someone in sin and you go to them.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.380]   You don't wanna make a public issue out of it.
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.300]   You're not eager to drag everybody's private sins
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.420]   into the public.
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.140]   You know you've got your own issues.
[00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.300]   You're taking the log out of your own eye
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.860]   before you take the speck out of anybody else's.
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.500]   But once you've done all that appropriate self-assessment
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.940]   and humbled yourself before God
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.780]   and declared your own dependence on grace alone,
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.380]   then you do go.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.300]   This is what love does.
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.220]   It goes, and in her case,
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.820]   maybe a girlfriend sleeping with a boyfriend,
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.380]   and she goes, she said, "This is not biblical.
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.280]   "It's not right.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.500]   "It doesn't please the Lord."
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.260]   And she pleads with her.
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260]   And she may or may not win her over.
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260]   In the next step, verse 16 of Matthew 18 says,
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.060]   "But if he does not listen,
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.340]   "take one or two along with you
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.880]   "that every charge may be established
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.700]   "by the evidence of two or three witnesses."
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.060]   So you can see there's no rush to judgment here.
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.500]   There's no rush to get this in front of the church here.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.220]   We're bending over backwards here to keep it small,
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.620]   keep it private, not do any more public hurt
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.740]   than is necessary.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.480]   So you take a friend or two who probably knows her,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.660]   who loves her, and you go to her together.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.400]   Now, she may not let you do this, but you try.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.480]   And you say together, "We love you.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.320]   "We care for you.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.260]   "Can we pray with you?
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.960]   "We want you out of this ongoing sin
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.500]   "because it's gonna damage you.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.720]   "It's gonna damage him.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.840]   "It's gonna damage your witness.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.640]   "It's gonna damage, ultimately, the church,
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.800]   "and it's gonna dishonor Christ."
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.880]   And you try to persuade.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.120]   And the third step is,
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.640]   "If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church."
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.920]   Now, this is the point at which the gathered church
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.720]   in some kind of appropriate meeting
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   hears the news and acts on it.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.640]   And the first action is for the church to say,
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.320]   "We want you to return,"
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.160]   because this is not excommunication yet.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.280]   It's the whole church praying and aching and longing.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.860]   And the last step is,
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.640]   "If he refuses to listen even to the church,
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.360]   "let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector."
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.120]   And what that means is that the church then
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.640]   takes some kind of step to cut that person off,
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.820]   like from the communion table
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.400]   and from normal, ongoing relationships
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.480]   that you would ordinarily have with a believer
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.520]   in doing things together.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.680]   As those who share the same commitment to Jesus,
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.960]   you cut them off.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.960]   And that means not that you've damned them,
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.480]   but that you've put them in a position
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.840]   where you are longing and praying for their repentance.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.900]   I've seen it happen,
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.860]   and it's intended to happen in the Bible,
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.480]   that this kind of excommunication is doubly redemptive.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.060]   It's redemptive for the church
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.600]   so that the truth of the gospel and its power
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.120]   not be lost by pretending people are believers
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.520]   when they don't bear any fruit.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.160]   And it's redemptive for the person
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.840]   who's being excommunicated,
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.640]   because we see in 1 Corinthians 5 and 1 Thessalonians
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.080]   that the aim of this ostracism is redemptive.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.720]   That is, we want them to be brought to repentance
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.520]   and restored to the church.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.840]   And to that end, we do talk to them.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.160]   We do reach out like we would to any unbeliever in love,
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.280]   and we would happily lay down our lives
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.160]   that they would repent.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.160]   There's nothing ugly or hostile in this.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.840]   This is all designed to do everything the church can do
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.340]   to keep itself true and authentic and holy and pure,
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.200]   and to love other people back to the Savior.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.940]   So my answer to her is, yes, there is excommunication,
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.920]   and Matthew 18 is there to be followed
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.440]   in those kinds of steps.
