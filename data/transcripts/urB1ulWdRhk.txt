[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   What are people getting wrong when they think about starting meditating?
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.100]   Oh man, so many things.
[00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.020]   Um, just a little context.
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.800]   So I was considered, I consider myself to be a meditation dabbler for several years.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.520]   So I was one of those people, you know, I would start and then I would stop for a
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.100]   long stretch of time and come back to it and to pick it up again and then just do
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.740]   it for a week or two and then stop.
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:34.260]   And, and then I met a teacher in Los Angeles in 2003 who gave me what I now
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.240]   recognize as a more minimalist approach to, um, meditation.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.760]   And what I realized was that I was just doing way too much.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.760]   I was doing too much.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.940]   And that was one of the reasons why I was having so many clunky experiences and I
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.780]   was labeling my mind as a monkey mind.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.280]   And so I would say, you know, one of the biggest misconceptions is that you need
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.440]   to do all these things.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.080]   You need to let go of this and notice that.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.940]   Witness your thoughts like clouds in the sky and focus on your breath and
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.820]   vision the white light.
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.120]   And you don't need to do any of that stuff.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.080]   In fact, it works a lot better.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.700]   And when I say better, I mean, you have more delightful experiences if you do
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.760]   less and then if you do least and ultimately if you can do nothing and
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.140]   just, and just practice pure being, that's when it works the best.
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.100]   So I learned how to do that.
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.480]   I learned how to operate in concert with my shrinking mind.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.180]   And that was a big game changer for me.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.360]   It literally made me, um, an enthusiastic daily meditator within a couple of days.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.740]   And before that, I was probably one of the most reluctant meditators because I
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.120]   just felt like my mind was all over the place.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.460]   I was sitting there with my eyes closed, waiting for the time to pass.
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.920]   My body was riding in pain, it felt like torture.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.340]   And then it would feel like dessert.
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.720]   And, uh, and it was amazing.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.560]   And, and I recognized that I wanted to, I wanted to be on this mission to help
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.140]   introduce as many people as possible to this feeling.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.100]   It's like, it's kind of like, you know, I did psilocybin for the first time, uh,
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.220]   several months ago, and I've never been a big plant medicine person.
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.220]   Um, but I happened to be in a, in a retreat in the middle of nowhere in
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.520]   Northern California and everybody was about to do this ceremony.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.820]   And I was like, okay, fine.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.280]   You know, I'll, I'll do it because I have nothing else to do.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.660]   And I, very least I can write about it, but it was a very enjoyable experience.
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.280]   Um, it wasn't something I necessarily want to do again and again, because
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.580]   it just, it is so involved, but I equate meditation, just daily
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.580]   meditation to be as good as that.
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.260]   And you don't have to take any mushrooms.
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.060]   You don't have to be somewhere laid out with the eye mask on in the middle of nowhere.
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.980]   You could, it's like, you'd bring that serenity from that experience wherever you are.
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.980]   So you can have that experience in the back of an Uber, you could have it on an airplane.
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.240]   You could have it in, in your aunt's living room.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.540]   You could have it in your office chair, wherever you happen to be sitting and, and you, and
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.120]   you have the ability to close your eyes for 10 or 15 minutes, you can, you can drop right
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.120]   into that experience.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.880]   And that's the power of that shift I experienced in meditation.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.640]   And I'm just, I'm excited to introduce as many people as possible to that.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.000]   And all the books I've written have been about exposing those, those misconceptions.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.080]   And my most recent book, Travel Light, same thing.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.520]   It's just like, it's bare bones, minimalist approach, stripping away things that I consider
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.960]   to be unnecessary for having that particular experience.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.260]   And what does the science say when you strip all that stuff away?
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.800]   Do you have the same impact on your life and the same outcomes?
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.800]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.400]   The science actually, um, there's been a lot of people studying meditation recently.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   Okay.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.240]   The godfather of meditation research is this guy named Dr. Herbert Vincent.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.520]   He's a Harvard cardiologist.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.840]   He studied the stress response for many, many years.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.040]   He was one of Walter Cannon's proteges.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:24.920]   Walter Cannon was the professor who coined the term fight, flight reaction at Harvard.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:32.080]   And Vincent was tracked down by these meditators from the local Cambridge Transcendental Meditation
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.720]   Center, because no one had ever really studied it properly.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.800]   And this is like in the late 1960s, early 1970s.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.800]   And he dismissed them.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.700]   He said, no, I'm not studying you guys.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.640]   Because back then, studying something like meditation would be akin to, you know, studying
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.400]   spirit animals now.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.320]   Like, no serious professor is going to bring in people who claim to have a spirit animal
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.320]   into the laboratory and study them.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.120]   And, uh, but they kept coming back.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.120]   They were persistent.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.320]   And eventually, um, he figured he had nothing to lose.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.480]   And when he connected them to all the different measuring devices, he was shocked by what
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.480]   he saw.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.640]   He basically, again, this is somebody who was probably one of the world's experts in
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.720]   the fight or flight reaction.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.000]   He saw that everything that happened to the fight or flight reaction goes in the opposite
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.440]   direction during what he later coined as the relaxation response.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.220]   He's the one that came up with the term relaxation response.
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.720]   He wrote a New York Times bestselling book about the effects of meditation called The
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.720]   Relaxation Response.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.800]   And the reason why his research is relevant to this day is because back then, they could
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.080]   test anything they wanted to.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.360]   Nowadays, you can only test one or two things.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.160]   And there's got to be time apart, and you can't, you know, stick rectal thermometers
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.760]   up in the people and do all these kind of invasive measurements.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.920]   Well, he was able to do everything.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.080]   He was completely unrestricted.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.700]   It was free range back then.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:15.080]   And so, he's got the most thorough results of anyone who's ever tested meditation.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:22.920]   And so, the relaxation response, according to his research, gets triggered by three things
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.960]   basically - three essential things.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.000]   Number one, you have to be sitting comfortably, comfortably, all right?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.480]   So, we think about meditation and we think about it as someone sitting with their what?
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.200]   Back straight, shoulders back, chin up, ideally with your legs crossed, maybe even with your
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.640]   fingers together.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:48.240]   That's the sort of classical posture for meditation.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.160]   Well, to trigger this response that he saw, where you go in the opposite direction of
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.480]   the fight/flight, you have to actually sit with back support.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.640]   You don't need to cross your legs, you don't need to hold your shoulders back, even your
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.120]   chin can be dropping forward as though it looks like you're falling asleep.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.320]   That's not actually what's happening.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:13.960]   Then he said you need a passive attitude, passive attitude, which means the opposite
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   of focus.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.400]   Focus is an active attitude.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.800]   You're trying to exclude experiences.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   You're trying to exclude the noise, the distracting thoughts, the distracting sensations, right?
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.400]   And you're supposed to be thinking about the fact that you're meditating.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.800]   Well, he said don't do that.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.040]   Just let whatever your mind is thinking about come into the experience.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:45.080]   And then third, you want some sort of anger point to come back to, whether it's your breath,
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.920]   whether it's a mantra, whether it's a word, a sound, something that's actually soothing
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.240]   to you, something that is sort of like your happy word or anger.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.480]   And if you have a combination of those three things, you can have the most profound experiences
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.040]   in the meditation.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.520]   And then if you continue exposing yourself to this state, this relaxation response over
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:14.200]   and over and over, eventually you can stabilize it, your body can stabilize it.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.240]   So this is another thing, another misconception that people have about meditation is that
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.880]   I can just meditate every now and again, and I'll still get the benefits from it.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.720]   But it doesn't work like that.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.400]   It's kind of like working out, right?
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.160]   Let's say you just worked out on Tuesdays and Saturdays.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.640]   Are you going to get as strong working out twice a week as you would get working out
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.480]   five times a week, right?
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.960]   It's still beneficial to work out twice a week versus not at all.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.920]   But if you want to stabilize the strength, if you want to cultivate it so that it's there
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.160]   all the time, you need to do it more often and the same applies to meditation.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.760]   It needs to be a daily practice.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:02.880]   And that's because the main thing that's keeping you from feeling fulfilled, happy, content,
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.840]   peaceful, that thing isn't taking any days off.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.240]   And that is the stress.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.600]   The stress is coming in every day.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.440]   The stress is like, you know, P90X or something.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.920]   It's like working on you every day.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:22.920]   So in order to counterbalance that, you need to do the thing that is like kryptonite distress,
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.880]   which is the meditation because the meditation supplies the body with biochemicals that can
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.720]   dissolve the stress.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.720]   You need to do that every day.
