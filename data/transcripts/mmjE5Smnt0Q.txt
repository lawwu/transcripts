[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.800]   in the book of the Prophet Jeremiah, chapter 17, verses 5, 6, 7 and 8.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.800]   It's a short paragraph.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.000]   Verses 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the 17th chapter of the book of the Prophet Jeremiah.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.200]   "Thus saith the Lord, 'Cursed be the man that trusteth in men, and maketh flesh his
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.920]   arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.960]   For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh, but shall
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.880]   inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land, and not inhabit it.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.320]   Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:01.600]   For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.200]   and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green, and shall not be careful
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.360]   in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.'"
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:22.000]   Now, this prophet, this man, Jeremiah, was one of those men who was called by God to
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.840]   one of the most difficult, and in many ways unpleasant tasks to which any human being
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.560]   can ever be called.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.880]   He was called to deliver the message of God.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.960]   And what made his task so particularly trying and difficult was that he was standing more
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.240]   or less alone.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.800]   There were others in that same country who called themselves prophets, and they claimed
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.240]   to be the prophets of God, but they did not agree with this man's message.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.680]   So Jeremiah found himself in this most unhappy and unenviable position of standing as it
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:11.920]   were alone to deliver a message that cut right across what was being said and thought by
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.480]   the vast majority, almost all, his contemporaries and his fellow countrymen.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.460]   And yet he did it, and he went on doing it.
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.040]   He went on doing it at all costs, and in spite of much suffering and persecution that he
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.880]   had to endure.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.280]   And the question that naturally arises in our minds is, what is it that enabled the
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.560]   man to do this?
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.480]   Because it cannot be explained in terms of his temperament.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.080]   We know enough about him from what he tells us himself to know that by nature he was a
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.040]   rather timorous kind of person, nervous, apprehensive, a man who was very sensitive and who felt
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.920]   things very keenly.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.440]   So it was not that.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.960]   It was not his natural boldness and temperament.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.360]   Indeed it was not even that he delighted in being different or taking a stand on his own.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.360]   He did not.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.240]   He tells us repeatedly how he almost expostulated with God and pleaded with him that he might
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.020]   give him some other kind of message.
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.680]   And there were times indeed when Jeremiah felt so keenly his isolation and his solitude
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.120]   that he even decided not to speak at all.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.660]   He said, "I'll say nothing.
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.520]   Every time I speak it but arouses antagonism and the people hate me for it.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.200]   So I'll say nothing."
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.240]   And there he was, sitting in his corner as it were, deciding to say nothing.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.360]   But then he tells us that this word of God began to burn like fire in his bones and he
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.520]   had to speak again.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.680]   And so he spoke and so he went on.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.800]   And I say that there is ultimately only one adequate explanation of this man and his great
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   story and that is that he was absolutely certain and sure that what he was saying was none
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.380]   other than the message and the word of God.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.080]   And it was for that reason that he had to go on doing it.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.240]   It was because this word of God burned in his bones that he couldn't resist.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.240]   He had to continue.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.080]   So we are reminded of all that in this opening phrase of these verses that we are looking
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.600]   at together, "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.760]   And whatever Jeremiah might have felt like, whatever he may have chosen, whatever he may
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.520]   have been inclined to do, this was what God said and he just has to repeat it.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.640]   And he did repeat it.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.680]   Now you notice that his message was a message of warning.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.400]   He was one of the last of the prophets in that land of Israel.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.800]   God had sent a whole series of prophets to this people, this recalcitrant, sinful people.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.320]   And he had warned them, he had threatened them, but they wouldn't listen.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.280]   Jeremiah is about the last.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.520]   And to him was committed this message of saying that doom and disaster were at hand.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.640]   That the sin of Israel is written with a pen of iron and with a pint of a diamond.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.040]   It is graven upon the table of their heart and upon the horn of your altars.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.760]   The thing seems to be so deeply ingrained that nothing can be done at all about it.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:36.400]   And God, through this man Jeremiah, begins to tell the children of Israel of the punishment
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   that is coming upon them, surely, certainly, swiftly.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:48.280]   And yet, he still gives them a final opportunity.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.120]   He still gives them a last word of warning.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.120]   The end has not yet come.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.280]   He sends his prophet to them with this tremendous message, calling them to repentance.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.560]   Calling them to realize the position, ere it is too late, to repent and to return to
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.240]   God.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.720]   Now that's what we have in this passage which we are going to look at tonight.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.840]   It's just one of many such passages in this book.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.040]   God kept on giving him the same message and sending him to the people.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.640]   All this, of course, is something that happened actually in history.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.080]   Alas, the children of Israel did not listen to Jeremiah.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.440]   And because they didn't listen, God meted out upon them the punishment that he had threatened.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:46.920]   The Chaldean army came, surrounded the city, destroyed its walls and battlements, entered
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.560]   into the city, razed their great buildings, the temple included, to the ground, and carried
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.840]   the people away, captive, to a strange land.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.200]   Even as God had warned them here, "O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.760]   thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin throughout all thy borders, and thou,
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.480]   even thyself, shall discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee."
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.880]   It was God who had given them that land, but it's going to be taken from them.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:24.000]   "And I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in a land which thou knowest not."
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.020]   And that very thing literally and actually and historically happened to them.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.040]   But this isn't only history.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.440]   It is history, but it's more than history.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:44.280]   It is a very perfect representation and portrayal of God's message to mankind, the whole world,
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.160]   always, everywhere.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.440]   It is God's message to mankind this evening, and that is why I am calling your attention
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.960]   to it.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:03.360]   Here we are, men and women, living in a world like this.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.480]   We are all conscious of troubles and difficulties and problems.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.920]   We are all aware that things are not as they ought to be.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.200]   Things seem to be going wrong.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.120]   Life is a burden, life's a problem.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:23.400]   And we are ill at ease, and we are anxious and perplexed in many senses and in many respects.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.560]   And the great question is why?
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.560]   That's the problem.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.640]   It's always the problem with mankind.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.320]   You see, it was the problem with these children of Israel.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.680]   Things were going wrong and they were aware of that.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.880]   But the question confronting them was, well, what is it?
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.720]   Is it something very serious or is it something light and superficial?
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.200]   All the false prophets, of course, were unanimous in saying that it was nothing serious at all.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.040]   So the prophet Jeremiah charges them with this, that they have healed the affliction
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:59.280]   of the daughter of my people lightly, saying, "Peace, peace, when there is no peace."
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.280]   You know the message.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.920]   It's all right, they said.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.400]   Don't be too alarmed, don't take it too seriously.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.400]   Carry on.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.480]   Things are not as bad as that.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.120]   We admit they're not perfect, but they're not as bad as that.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.480]   You needn't be serious about it.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.480]   Carry on.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.480]   Go on with your drinking and dancing.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.480]   Go on with your pleasures.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.480]   It's all right.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.480]   It's a temporary crisis.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.640]   It will blow over, it will pass away.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.840]   There's nothing profound.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.000]   That was their message.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.360]   And those one men had to stand alone and say it's a lie that isn't true.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.240]   "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.880]   Now I say the position is still the same.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:41.080]   And we are still confronted by the two messages, the two points of view.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:46.480]   There are still two groups in the world, and there are only two groups in the last analysis.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:53.180]   There are those who are Christian, and there are those who are not Christian.
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.880]   And what we've really got in this brief paragraph, verses 5 to 8 in this seventeenth
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.840]   chapter of Jeremiah, is a description of the two groups.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.920]   You notice it's a series of contrasts.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:09.580]   "Blessed be the man that trusteth in men, blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord."
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.080]   We are given a series of contrasts.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.720]   We are shown certain things about them.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:24.960]   We are shown that these contrasts are the result of two different attitudes.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.720]   They've got two fundamentally different attitudes.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.880]   The one man trusts in men and maketh flesh his own, and his heart departs from God.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.520]   The other man is a man who trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.480]   An entirely different attitude.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.720]   In the same way, we are told that their experiences are absolutely opposed.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.520]   You remember the description of the first man, he we are told is like the heath in the
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.880]   desert who shall not see when good cometh, but shall inhabit the parched places in the
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.000]   wilderness in a salt land and not inhabit it.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.200]   But how different is the other?
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:06.100]   The other is like a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out her roots by the river,
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.160]   and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green and he shall still go
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.880]   on yielding fruit.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.200]   The experiences of the two men are entirely different.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.000]   Yes, and the end of the two men is also entirely different.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.960]   Cursed, blessed.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:30.840]   You see, in this brief paragraph, in its perfect pictorial dramatic manner, we are given this
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:37.600]   extraordinary portrayal of the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.800]   The two old views, they're still with us.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.320]   As these people faced their problems and the threat of calamities, there was this division
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.760]   into two positions.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.000]   It's exactly the same still tonight.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.600]   And surely there is nothing more important that we can do at this hour than to pay heed
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:02.120]   and attention to these things, because we are listening to one or other of these two
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:08.240]   messages, one or the other of these two positions, even as the children of Israel were of old.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.080]   Well, therefore, I hurry on to show you certain points which emerge here.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.960]   The thing, it seems to me, that is so vitally important is that we should realize that the
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:23.440]   difference between these two positions is a fundamental one.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.140]   It is an essential one.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.400]   It is a vital difference.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:36.280]   Now I mean by that something like this, that I sometimes imagine that the supreme achievement
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:41.760]   of the devil is to blur essential distinctions.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.120]   He's interested in grey always.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.360]   He doesn't like black or white.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.960]   And he has taught mankind to listen to him.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.040]   We don't like these either-ors, these extremes, we say.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.000]   We rather like the middle-of-the-road men, the safe men, the men who's not violent on
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.680]   one side or the other.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.580]   And we're like that in our view of life, as we are in most other things.
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.760]   We say we mustn't have these stark, striking contrasts.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:14.600]   But my dear friends, that is of the very essence of the subtlety of sin and of the devil.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:21.520]   You notice that in this paragraph what we are given is a complete contrast.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.840]   The two men are absolutely different.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.900]   They really share very few things in common.
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.080]   The one thing really is that they're both alive in the same world.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.040]   Otherwise they are essentially different.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.040]   What am I trying to say?
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:40.280]   I'm just trying to say this, that the great lie of the present century and of the last
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:46.360]   hundred years has been to blur the distinct edges of Christianity and of the Christian
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.160]   faith.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.480]   The Christian, according to the Bible, is a man who stands out apart.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.480]   He's discreet.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.480]   He's distinct.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:04.520]   It's a lie which suggests that a man may be a Christian without knowing it, and that
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.200]   indeed you cannot ultimately define a Christian at all.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:14.760]   Now I can give you abundant proof of the point I'm making.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:23.080]   It's something that appears before us constantly as we read newspapers, books, journals, day
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.160]   by day.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.520]   The same thing keeps on coming up.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.520]   You get this sort of phrase.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.920]   They're writing an obituary notice about some great man or making an assessment about
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.920]   somebody.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:40.900]   They say, "Of course he wasn't a formal Christian, but..."
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:45.180]   You see the whole idea is this, that though a man may deny the very cardinal articles
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.600]   of the Christian faith, well, he may still be a Christian.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.000]   Look at his life, they say.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Look what he's done.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.560]   Look at his good ideas.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.600]   Look at various other things about him.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:05.620]   Not a formal Christian, not what we normally regard as a Christian, but must be a Christian.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.320]   In other words, you see, you can't tell what a Christian is.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:15.320]   The whole thing is so nebulous, it's so vague, and it's so indefinite, I say that's the devil's
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.080]   own lie.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.640]   If there is one message that is clearer than any other in this book from beginning to end,
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:28.760]   it is this, that God's people and the others stand out as absolutely distinct and separate.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:37.000]   And unless we know that we are Christians, the probability is that we are not Christians.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.940]   The things that we are told here, I say, are perfectly definite.
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.100]   It's the difference between cursing and blessing.
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:50.720]   It's the difference between that heath in the desert and that tree by the side of the
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.720]   river.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:59.240]   It is the utter and entire difference of a man whose trust is in the Lord and a man whose
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.680]   trust is in himself in man.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:09.200]   Well, very well, I emphasize it merely for this reason, that we will never know the blessings
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.640]   of the Christian faith.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:18.400]   We will never know the blessings of salvation until we are perfectly convinced in our minds
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.480]   that this is something discreet and definite.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.520]   Take the life of any saint that's ever lived in this world.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.360]   Take the life of any man who has mastered his circumstances and surroundings.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.720]   Now this is a year in which there are great celebrations going to be held with regard
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.680]   to certain martyrs who died at the stake for the Christian faith here in London and in
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.760]   other places four hundred years ago in the reign of Queen Mary.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.760]   Read the lives of those men.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.840]   Take advantage of this year to do so.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:58.200]   Those men who willingly went to the stake and laid down their lives for what they believed.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:04.920]   Now those men are men made on a grand scale in a big mold, men whom you must admire and
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.920]   revere, heroes of men.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.160]   What was their secret?
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.900]   Well, their secret was that they knew exactly what they believed.
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.400]   You don't go to the stake unless you know exactly what you believe.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.880]   You don't die for some indefinite, vague kind of philosophy.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.440]   If a man isn't certain, he's not going to lay down his life.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:33.000]   Now the secret of these men was that they knew exactly what they believed.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.820]   They said this is true and that isn't.
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.200]   People tried to make them compromise.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.440]   They said don't be so extreme.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.160]   Just give a little concession to Roman Catholicism.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.120]   Just modify your statement of it just a little bit.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.120]   They said we can't.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.120]   It's either this or that.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.160]   They can't both be true at one and the same time.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.320]   A man is either justified by faith alone or as he's served by the church.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.320]   It can't be both.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.000]   It's one or the other.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.360]   And they knew.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.600]   They were definite.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.600]   They were certain.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.080]   The thing was clear.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:08.920]   And it's always been true of God's men who have triumphed in this world, who could smile
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:15.840]   in the face of death, who could laugh at cruel tyrants, who were more than conquerors.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.160]   The thing is clear, it's distinct, it's definite.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:26.800]   And here I say we are shown the lines of distinction, the points which separate.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.500]   Now I want to call your attention to this, and this evening I can do nothing more than
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:36.880]   really introduce the matter by dealing with the first thing.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:43.960]   And the first thing, obviously, which differentiates these two people is that they have a fundamentally
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.000]   different attitude.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.880]   That's the thing that really separates them.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:55.400]   There are two attitudes towards life and its attendant circumstances.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.720]   And as it divided these people in the days of Jeremiah, it divides people in exactly
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.280]   the same way this evening.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.040]   Well now, how does it do so?
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:12.680]   Well the first thing I think which we see here is this.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:23.960]   The Christian, the godly view of life, is a view that makes us consider life as a whole,
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:28.800]   as an entity.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.280]   How can I put this?
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.280]   This is something which is emphasized in the Bible from the beginning to end, as you see
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.840]   this great division into God's people and the other people.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:46.780]   The characteristic of God's people is that they see life as a whole.
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.880]   They don't see it in a kind of atomistic manner.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.760]   They don't see it in compartments and segments.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.760]   They're concerned not so much about the details of what happened to them as about the whole
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.960]   thing.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:08.360]   Are we not here face to face with one of the greatest dangers that confronts us all?
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.200]   It's almost inevitable, isn't it?
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.200]   And we have to fight in this respect.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:20.120]   The danger of course is for us all to lose ourselves in the details of life and to view
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.880]   life as I say in that atomistic manner.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:29.200]   Now this is true not only of life in general, it's true of our various professions and callings
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.160]   and work in life.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:38.040]   That's why a businessman has his stock taken.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.200]   That's why he believes in having a balance sheet.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.800]   You see if you go on letting a business just go on from day to day, things come in and
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.600]   things go out, you don't really know what's happening to you.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.480]   You may be very busy but you may be losing money.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.160]   And now and again you've got to stand right apart and say, "Very well, there are lots
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.760]   of people coming in and a lot of trade is taking place.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.120]   We are receiving checks and sending out checks.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.360]   We seem to be having a marvellously good time but wait a minute, aren't we?
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.280]   What's happening to the whole of the business?"
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.880]   You see though you may be tremendously busy in segments and in departments, the business
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.680]   as a whole may be losing money.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.600]   So you stand back and you have your balance sheet, your stock taking and your assessment.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.840]   Now that's it.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:29.120]   It's the same I say in every respect in life.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.920]   Men can even preach the gospel as I do here from Sunday to Sunday.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.940]   And if as long as I look at it merely in terms of coming into this pulpit and preaching twice
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.920]   on a Sunday and getting and doing the same thing next Sunday, my ministry will go wrong.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.840]   I've got to be the whole.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.840]   What am I doing?
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.400]   What's it leading to?
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.120]   Don't you find this difficult?
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.480]   Isn't it difficult to realise that you get older every day you live?
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:02.520]   Don't the days and the hours and the weeks and the years slip by and somehow or another
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.200]   we are getting older and we don't realise it.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.800]   We don't realise we are our age.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:11.560]   We remember thinking of people our present age, years ago how old we thought they were.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.120]   We've arrived at that age.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.120]   We don't feel that.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.600]   We don't realise it's happening to us.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.520]   But it is happening.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.400]   And that is the case you see because we tend to allow circumstances to rule us and to govern
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.560]   us and to dictate our lives to us.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.720]   We've just got certain things we've got to do.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.800]   We've got to get up and light the fire and do this and that.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.960]   And so we spend our days doing these things and we never seem to realise that life is
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.240]   a whole.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:43.000]   And that something tremendous is happening while we are in this life and in this world.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:51.840]   Cursing, blessing, it says something big you see.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.680]   As we live in this life and in this world we are doing tremendous things.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:06.320]   The life is the most tremendous thing that one can think of apart from God himself.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.640]   We are in this world and while we think that we are just eating and drinking, marrying
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.680]   and giving in marriage and buying and selling and planting and sewing and so on, in the
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.920]   meantime something terrific is taking place.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.440]   Something is happening to the whole business.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:29.320]   Something is taking place in the entire concern that we are not aware of while we are simply
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.120]   immersed in the little details.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.600]   But it's happening.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.360]   As it happens in that man's business it's happening in your life and mine.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:42.240]   There's a great movement either in that direction or in this direction and it's
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.440]   happening to you at this very moment.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:50.480]   It's always taking place.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.960]   According to the Bible the most important thing for us to realise is that there's
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:24:01.120]   a fundamental trend in everybody's life.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:09.120]   There's a fundamental movement in one direction or else in the other direction.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.280]   And it is because mankind fails to realise that that he doesn't stop to think and
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.240]   to ask certain vital questions.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   And the questions are these.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.520]   What is life?
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.400]   What is the meaning of life?
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.520]   What's the purpose of life?
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.120]   Is this the only life?
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.440]   What happens at the end of this life?
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.160]   You see those are the questions.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.000]   Those are the really vital questions.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.960]   Not those little details that take up so much of our time and attention, but this whole
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.480]   movement.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.800]   Because according to the Bible I am passing through this world and I'm going on to a
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:52.440]   destiny, blessing, cursing, a total movement of my whole being and personality.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:57.160]   And you know every one of us is going through that process.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.760]   But do we realise that?
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:07.080]   The mother can be so busy in cooking for her husband and her children and donning their
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.920]   socks and making their clothing and keeping the house clean that she forgets that she's
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.680]   a living soul and that she's determining her eternal destiny while she's doing these
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.680]   very things.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:23.120]   She's forgotten the whole business and has been lost in the details of the little
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.120]   departments.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:32.840]   Very well then, may I put it as a question before we go any further.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:38.320]   Do you know what the fundamental trend of your life is?
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.360]   Do you know for certain in which direction you're moving?
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.840]   Have you ever sat down to think about that?
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.360]   That's what the Bible always calls us to do.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.280]   It calls us to stop and to think and to consider.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.680]   It says look here, see yourself as a whole and ask yourself this question.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.400]   Which direction are you moving in?
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.680]   You must be moving in one or the other.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.560]   What's happening to you as a totality, as a personality?
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.400]   Where are you going?
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:13.240]   Because as you live from day to day and hour to hour, all that is involved and all that
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.240]   is being determined.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.640]   Well now then, having put it like that, that leads us to the second vital question which
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.640]   is this.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:28.600]   It's all very well to say that as someone, but how can I know?
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.600]   How am I to decide?
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.000]   How am I to determine?
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   And that you see brings us up against the great and central and primary question, namely
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.960]   the question of authority.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:48.280]   It always comes back in the last analysis to this question of authority.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:52.080]   I've said that we are all here together in the same life and in the same world.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.360]   We are subject to the same accidents.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.320]   We are subject to the same things that are happening.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.200]   If a war breaks out, we'll all be involved together, as we were in the last war, whether
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.960]   we are Christians or not Christians.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:06.920]   Ah yes, I say that is true, but fundamentally there are these two great attitudes and they
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.480]   make all the difference in the world at a time of war and when things go wrong.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.720]   Yes, but says someone, how do I know which is right?
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.920]   What is the authority?
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.000]   And here again you see there are only two authorities.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.280]   There are only two views.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.200]   There are only two positions.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:36.960]   It's either man or else it is thus saith the Lord.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.680]   And you and I at this moment are in one or two of those positions.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:51.720]   We are either basing our view upon man or else we are basing it upon God as he has revealed
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.840]   it in this book, which is his word.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:01.120]   Now I like to think of the business of the Christian church and of preaching in those
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.720]   terms.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.280]   Every Christian is in the position of this man Jeremiah.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.120]   And the business of Christian preaching is to do precisely what Jeremiah had to do in
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:18.360]   his day and in his own generation.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:24.360]   It is to see that this word of God, this word of the Lord, this thus saith the Lord is heard
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:29.000]   amidst the Babel of Isis.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.760]   We are familiar, are we not, with the Babel of Isis.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.680]   We know what men are saying.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:41.000]   Never have we been so well aware of what men say.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.560]   It's an age of advertising.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.000]   It's an age of propaganda.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.160]   It's an age of selling goods, of putting it over, as they say.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:54.240]   Those are the phrases, getting in the idea, suggesting it, throwing it out, and we are
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.000]   literally being bombarded by words.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.440]   Modern men, perplexed, bewildered, unhappy and uncertain, is being addressed from morning
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.960]   to night by newspapers, radio, television.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:12.920]   A thousand and one voices come clamouring at him, speaking to him, suggesting to him
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.680]   ways of life, means of living, answers to questions.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.480]   There he is in the midst of them all.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:28.160]   Man is still speaking, and he is shouting at us.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.200]   And the voices, I say, are a veritable babel.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.080]   And though they may seem to be contradicting one another and disagreeing with themselves,
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.000]   they all really belong to the same realm.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.320]   They all come from men.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.120]   Whether it is that they advise you just to eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die,
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:51.360]   or whether it is the highest idealism that is confronting the human race at this moment,
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.160]   whether it is that they say, "Look here, in the name of decency we ought to rise up
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.480]   and prohibit the atomic bomb," or whether it is the view that says, "Well, it doesn't
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.120]   matter very much what happens.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.320]   Let's get on with it while we are here and have as good a time as we can.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.760]   And don't bother your mind too much about these great questions.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.280]   Don't go and meet war.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.720]   It'll come soon enough.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.600]   Just let yourself go and have your fling."
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.120]   Fundamentally, they are the same.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.440]   They are simply the views of men.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:23.640]   That's one side, you see.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:30.440]   It's men speaking to us and men telling us about ourselves and about life.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.400]   And it's the majority voice, of course.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:40.120]   The thousands, the millions, the large battalions, the money, it's all on that side.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:46.440]   And here on the other side stands the Christian message, as Jeremiah stood apparently almost
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:55.120]   alone to face the false prophets and the mess of the populace in his own day and generation.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.400]   And what have we got to say?
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:04.080]   We have simply one thing to say, and it is this, "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.240]   And it's the only reason for speaking.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.640]   It's the only plea for preaching.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.960]   Let me put it personally.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.360]   It's my only reason for being in this pulpit.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.400]   I'm not here to revise my own opinions, my own ideas.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:26.840]   My one command, my one commission is to deliver this message of God, "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.720]   I know nothing apart from this.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:33.640]   I'm simply trying to expound it, to show what it says.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.400]   It is our only authority.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:43.680]   And I don't ask anybody to listen to what I'm saying tonight for any reason at all,
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.320]   but that this is, "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.040]   I don't ask anybody to consider the Christian faith and to become a Christian for any other
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.040]   reason.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:59.120]   I never ask people to become Christians because of certain experiences.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.520]   I don't ask you to become a Christian because I can point to somebody else and say, "Look
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.520]   at that person.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.520]   He was once not a Christian.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.520]   He's now a Christian.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.880]   Listen to what he's got to say.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.200]   He gives his experience."
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.920]   I don't say that.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:17.560]   I don't recommend my message in terms of experiences for the good reason that there
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.860]   are many agencies that can do that.
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:25.080]   If you put up happiness and things like that as the only test, well, the world can meet
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.080]   it.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.080]   It can match it.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.960]   But, my friend, my only reason for preaching this message is that I believe it is God's
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:36.480]   Word and that whether you and I are going through an intense period of misery and of
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:45.680]   trial and of tribulation or not, we must believe it because it is what it is.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.120]   That's the reason for believing the gospel, because it's God's Word.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.640]   I don't want to plead with you and appeal to you and whittle you, as it were, into it.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.640]   No, no.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.240]   You must believe it's God's Word or else you don't.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:02.360]   If you believe it's God's Word, you won't be long before you make clear your decision
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.360]   for it.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.280]   But that's the only reason for becoming a Christian.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.880]   It's our only authority.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.080]   Well, now, that is the claim that is made always for it in the Old Testament and the
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.160]   New Testament.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:22.080]   Look at these Old Testament writers.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.400]   Not a man of them stands up and says, "Listen to me.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.400]   This is what I say.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.480]   This is what I think."
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.480]   Not one of them says, "Look here.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.200]   I've been studying life and its problems and I've come to this conclusion."
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.200]   Not a man.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.040]   They all stand up and they say this, "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:42.000]   Some of them, like Jeremiah, as I've already reminded you, have almost said, "Woe to God!
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.200]   I hadn't got to say it.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.200]   I know it isn't liked.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.200]   I know it isn't popular.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.360]   I know it'll be ridiculed and laughed at, but I can't help it.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   Thus saith the Lord.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.800]   The burden of the Lord.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.360]   God's given it me."
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:34:00.040]   The same is exactly true of the apostles of the New Testament.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.360]   Ask the apostle Paul why he preached, and this is his answer.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:07.280]   "Woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.720]   The love of Christ constraineth me."
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.400]   He's a man under commission.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.760]   He's the bond slave of Jesus Christ.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.800]   It's God who called him.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.280]   It's God who sent him and who has commanded him to deliver his message.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.760]   It was Christ who sent the apostles all out.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.160]   "Ye shall be my witnesses.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:26.360]   Go out," he says, "and preach the word."
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.320]   And they went and did so.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:35.160]   And I say it is the only reason for proclaiming it and it's the only reason for believing
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.160]   it.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.160]   What's it mean?
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:44.160]   Well, let me analyze this great phrase, "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:49.640]   That is a description of the Bible.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:56.720]   And my position tonight is to put before you the Bible view of life and to do so because
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:06.320]   I claim that it is the word of God, that it is a unique book, that I know nothing and
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:12.400]   have no authority whatsoever apart from this book.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:16.360]   It is something the book claims for itself.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:23.400]   It claims that it has been inspired by the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:32.600]   All scripture, it saith itself, is given by inspiration of God.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:38.680]   In other words, what it claims for itself is that the Holy Spirit has breathed the message
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:42.000]   into the minds and the hearts of the men who wrote.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.400]   That's what they say themselves.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:53.360]   Prophecy of old says the apostle Peter came not by the will of men.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:36:01.480]   It is not of any human interpretation, he says, but holy men of God spake as they were
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:08.720]   moved or led or born along by the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.760]   That's the claim.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:19.480]   So you see, we claim for this that it has a special and a unique authority, that it
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:27.240]   is a revelation of God's mind, of God's truth.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:35.660]   So we confront the modern world in exactly the same way as Jeremiah confronted his contemporaries.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:41.120]   And we've got nothing to say except this, "Thus saith God."
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:47.100]   It's a revelation of God himself to mankind.
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:55.520]   It is a revelation of God himself and the truth which he tells us about himself.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:00.900]   And how vital it is that we should start at that point.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:05.940]   You listen to people talking today and they express their views about God and what they
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:10.640]   think of God and what they think God ought to do and what God ought not to do.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:16.200]   They even claim to themselves a right and a power to determine God and they make a God
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:22.180]   after their own image.
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:27.900]   But I have no knowledge of God apart from what I read in this book.
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:33.300]   I with all other men have a sense of God within me, but that doesn't give me a real knowledge
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.300]   of God.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:39.820]   My ideas, my philosophy is not enough.
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:48.380]   As the Apostle Paul put it to those Corinthians, "The world by wisdom knew not God."
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.580]   They tried to find him but they couldn't.
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:56.940]   But God has revealed himself and we have the revelation in this book.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:06.460]   His character, his might, his holiness, his greatness, his righteousness, it's all here.
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.500]   And you either believe it or you don't.
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:14.780]   You either believe that God is like this or else he's an indulgent God such as you'd
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:15.780]   like him to be.
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.300]   It's one or the other.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:23.320]   And you've got to take your choice.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:28.100]   But in exactly the same way this book is a revelation of what God tells us about the
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.940]   world.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:36.580]   It tells us about the origin of the world, the beginning of life.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:42.700]   You see, you either believe the modern theories and suppositions which say that it's all
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:47.780]   accident and chance and that it cannot be explained at all, but that there's some
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:56.220]   impersonal, vital force that happens to have done things, either that or else that God
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:00.340]   in the beginning made heaven and the earth and all things therein.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:05.020]   It's one or the other.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.300]   Is there a design?
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.300]   Is there a meaning?
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.300]   Is there a purpose?
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:14.340]   Or is it all just a clash of atoms and all the particles within the atoms?
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.340]   What is it?
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:19.460]   Is there a grand purpose or isn't there?
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.500]   Now you see, you either believe what men say or you believe what this says.
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:27.060]   And this claims that this is the revelation of what God teaches.
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:32.260]   By faith, says the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, we believe that the world was
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:39.240]   made out of nothing by the word of God.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:49.140]   And in the same way, with regard to men, we know men's ideas about men, don't we?
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:58.680]   The psychological school, the biological school, the economic school, and all the other schools.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:05.400]   But here we have something that claims to be God's view of men, that tells us about
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:12.040]   his origin, that he hasn't come and worked his way up from the primitive slime, but that
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:18.320]   he's been made by God in his own image, fashioned by the hands of the Creator, which is true
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.320]   of men.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:24.200]   It's one or the other.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.200]   And we are told about men's purpose and function in life.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.680]   And in this world, it's all here.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.840]   This claims to be God's teaching about that.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:38.920]   And I either listen to men or I listen to this.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.600]   And then about history.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.080]   We know what men say about history.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:49.680]   They're baffled by it at the present time, but we know their theories and their teachings
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.320]   and their ideas.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.040]   But if you really want to know about history, you must come here.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.560]   Here is God's teaching of history, God's view of history.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.880]   God began it, God will end it.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:06.640]   The certainty of it all, this is revelation.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:12.080]   And then about eternity itself.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:17.720]   For the Bible not only tells us about this world, but about the unseen.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:24.200]   Men speculate, they dabble with spiritism, they talk about another dimension, they play
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.160]   with the suprasensory ideas.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.360]   All right, let them do so, but they're simply groping, vaguely in the dark, they don't
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.360]   know.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.240]   Here is the authority of God.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:38.880]   This is what God says about eternity beyond time.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.680]   It's revelation.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:46.480]   It's inspired, and it's an inspired account of God's teaching.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.360]   That's the Bible.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:56.400]   And what Christianity does is to hold that before men.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:02.480]   With all the voices on your radios and your televisions and your cinemas and all the speechifying
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:11.800]   of men, there comes this old word, "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.960]   Here it is too late, listen to it.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:20.760]   But Jeremiah spoke to his contemporaries and warned and appealed and said, "Are you still
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.000]   not ready to listen?
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.520]   Here is what God says."
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:36.760]   So I have the great and the high privilege of standing before you and asking you to listen
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:44.840]   to what God has said and has revealed concerning his own thoughts about all these questions.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:50.560]   So I end by putting it in the form of a message.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:55.800]   For the Bible, after all, is not just a detached textbook.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:03.040]   It isn't simply a kind of library of information, wonderful though that is about the mind of
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:07.000]   God upon all our leading questions.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   It's more than that.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.280]   It's a message.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.280]   It's God addressing us.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.600]   It's God speaking to us.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:20.560]   God sends his servants to speak to us as he sent his Jeremiah, and this is what he tells
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.520]   us.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.760]   He tells us why things are as they are.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.760]   "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.480]   It isn't an economic question.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.040]   It isn't a political question.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:40.800]   It isn't a question of the right division of labour or of wealth or of any one of these
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.760]   other matters.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:48.040]   It isn't a particular philosophic political view held by one group on one side of a curtain
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.600]   and the other view held by others on the other side of the curtain.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.600]   No, no.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.600]   "This is it," says God.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.280]   "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.440]   It's the same thing on both sides of the Iron Curtain.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:06.800]   It's man in sin and in rebellion against me.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:11.880]   It isn't the haves and the have-nots.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:18.400]   It is that all of them together are more interested in themselves than they are in me.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:25.720]   The world is as it is, torn, divided, warring, alarmed, because man has forgotten God.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.440]   He doesn't listen to God.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.520]   He listens to men.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.400]   He hasn't listened to the "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:38.440]   Man is as he is, and the world is as it is, because men, made perfect by God, listen to
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:44.520]   the devil, rebelled against God and has brought doom and disaster upon himself.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:50.600]   That's the explanation.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:57.000]   But it also tells us what God thinks about that.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:04.200]   And at this point I not only understand Jeremiah and sympathize with him, I feel like him.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.680]   Don't laugh at me.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.160]   I'd like to be a popular preacher.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.360]   I'd like to say things that please people.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.120]   I'd like to send you home feeling happy and comforted every Sunday.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:20.240]   I'd like to say things that you say are wonderful, how beautiful, how nice.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:26.480]   I'd give anything if I could do that.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:31.960]   But the question is, do I do what I'd like to do, or do I deliver the message of this
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.200]   book?
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:41.400]   And if I deliver the message of this book, I must tell you about the wrath of God.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.600]   I've got to do what poor Jeremiah had to do.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.600]   I've got to say this.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:52.960]   "Ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn forever because of your sin."
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.920]   That's God's message to men, that man is as he is because of his sin, and God hates that
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:02.040]   sin, and God's going to punish that sin.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.720]   God cannot abide that sin.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.240]   He won't tolerate it.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:09.120]   He's going to deal with it, he's said so, and he's gone on repeating it.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:13.800]   He's put sin under condemnation, and his wrath must come upon sin.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:19.360]   He's said so.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.560]   But thank God we don't stop there.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.960]   That's a part of the message, my friend.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:27.760]   And if you reject that part of the message, don't believe what I'm about to say.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.680]   If you believe that you can have the love of God without first acknowledging his holy
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:37.720]   wrath, you don't understand love.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:42.840]   But the Bible does go on to tell us what God has done about our sin and our rebellion and
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:46.440]   our arrogance.
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.840]   This is a book packed with history.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.960]   It not only tells us that God made the world and that men sinned in his folly, but that
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:47:00.920]   God came down into the garden and spoke to men and said, "In spite of this, the seed
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:05.280]   of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:10.880]   And read the account of the unfolding of that promise in the Old Testament, how he chooses
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.360]   a particular man and turns him into a nation.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.120]   Abram, you see, children of Israel.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:22.640]   And then the tribe of Judah, the seed of David, he's preparing, the seed of the woman is
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.840]   coming, and at last, in the fullness of the times, he came.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:31.440]   "Thus saith the Lord, this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:36.320]   Hear him, listen to him.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.400]   And as you listen to him, this is what you hear.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:46.240]   "The Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto," he says, "but to minister and to
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.720]   give his life for ransom for many."
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:56.040]   The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:01.680]   He's come to deal with this terrible problem that has defeated men, patriarchs, the best
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.960]   men, they've all gone down.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.480]   He's come from heaven into the world in order to deal with it.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:11.960]   He takes it upon himself and he dies in order to deal with it.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.520]   He bears the punishment of sin.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.640]   He gives his life for ransom for many.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:25.800]   There is a way out, there is a way of reconciliation to God, a way back to God, a way which will
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:34.760]   lead us to peace and safety, so that when the whole world is involved in the conflagration
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:41.880]   of the final judgment, and doom and disaster, irrevocable and eternal, will fall upon all
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:42.880]   the godless.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:53.520]   Those who have fled for refuge into Jesus Christ will be eternally and everlastingly
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.520]   safe.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.520]   That's the message.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:02.040]   Thus saith the Lord.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:08.680]   The world in the twentieth century, in spite of all its education and culture and advances,
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:14.240]   is rapidly moving in the direction of disaster.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:21.680]   It's never been so evident and obvious, and it's all due to this thing called sin.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.600]   And there is only one way to deal with it.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:31.160]   It is the way of God's own making, in his own beloved Son, the Savior of the world.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:35.680]   And what God is saying to us tonight is this.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.000]   Listen, listen.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:46.800]   Ere it be too late, there is still time.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.800]   You are involved in all this.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.240]   Your life, as I said at the beginning, is a whole, and it's moving on.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:50:01.320]   You're either going to, blessing or cursing, heaven or hell.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.160]   But you needn't go to hell.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.200]   You needn't go to cursing.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:15.920]   Christ so loved you in spite of your sin and all that he died for you.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.800]   You have but to acknowledge and to confess your sin.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:24.120]   You have but to see that all your troubles and the trouble of the whole world come from
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:29.960]   that central forgetfulness of God and this self-centeredness and self-occupation and
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:34.440]   failure to realize the greatness and the dignity of man and of life.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:35.440]   Acknowledge it, confess it.
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.160]   That's what repentance means.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.400]   Don't defend yourself.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   Don't put up any plea.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:46.400]   Acknowledge you're all wrong, and especially for listening to man.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:57.040]   Repent and believe the gospel, and God will forgive all your sins, will let you know that
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:04.280]   he's reconciled you unto himself, will give you a new life and a new nature.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:10.920]   You'll become a new man, and you'll begin to see everything in a new way and in a new
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:24.240]   light so that, come what may, you will never be ashamed, never taken unawares, but always
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:31.120]   ready, because you belong to him.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:35.760]   Thus saith the Lord.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.760]   You believe him?
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:44.440]   If so, tell him so, and give your life yourself to him.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.960]   Amen.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:50.880]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
