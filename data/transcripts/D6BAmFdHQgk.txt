[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380]   (applause)
[00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.440]   So, there's a good reason that our next speaker
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.480]   is one of the most sought-after speakers
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.320]   in the financial planning space.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.320]   We have asked her to attend this conference
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.060]   a couple of years running, and she's had other engagements,
[00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.020]   and so we're so excited to have her here.
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.260]   She brings expertise to bear on several different areas,
[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260]   which is one of the reasons why everyone wants her
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.060]   to come talk at their conferences.
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.840]   So, she's a medical doctor.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.800]   She understands healthcare matters.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.480]   She's a financial planner.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.080]   That is her livelihood these days,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.880]   and she's a certified financial planner.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.620]   She's a human being who has worked with a lot of
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.360]   other human beings through her work,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.960]   and so she brings a wonderful human quality
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.860]   to both the healthcare and the financial planning
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.160]   side of things.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.760]   This is Carolyn McClanahan.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.300]   We're so excited to have her here.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.760]   Please give me a round of applause in thanking her.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.000]   (applause)
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.640]   - Okay, am I on, am I on?
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.900]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.080]   I am actually so excited to be here.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.480]   So many people who have been mentors and idols to me,
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.120]   like such as Christine, Bill Bangin, I mean, are here,
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.980]   and so just so excited that I could also be here this year.
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.760]   So, when Christine asked, "What do you want to talk about?"
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.600]   It took me no, I already knew what I wanted to talk about.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.720]   When should you do it yourself,
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.960]   or should you quit doing it themselves?
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.660]   So, a little bit of background.
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.160]   Started out, I was a doctor.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.500]   I would practice mainly emergency medicine.
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.380]   My husband's an engineer, and we did our own investing.
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.840]   I had a IRA when I was in residency,
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.480]   so started kind of early.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.720]   He inherited some money in the mid '90s.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.880]   We invested that money.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.120]   We did quite well because we were so brilliant, right?
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.360]   No, we were lucky, and towards the end of the '90s,
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.260]   and he had quit being an engineer,
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.360]   and he didn't want to go back.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.320]   He wanted to be a photographer and a track coach.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.900]   So, I married an engineer,
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.340]   but now he wanted to make no money, right?
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.740]   And I said, "Honey, I love you,
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.400]   "but I am not going to support you,
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.780]   "so we need to make sure this little bucket of money
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.540]   "that we've done well with is enough
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.740]   "for you to be able to quit."
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.020]   We knew it wasn't enough to retire,
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.380]   and we were only in our mid '30s,
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.020]   and I actually love medicine.
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.880]   I still volunteer to this day.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.460]   I love patient care.
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.780]   I do business of medicine.
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.880]   The culture of medicine is very challenging.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.000]   That is what I did not like.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.860]   So, I went back to school -- well, no.
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.720]   We tried to find a financial planner,
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.460]   and they were sales schmucks.
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.000]   They charged too much.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.500]   They didn't really do -- This was back in 2000.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.460]   They called themselves financial advisors,
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.380]   but all that really meant was investments
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.300]   and not really financial planning,
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.540]   and so they kept trying to, like,
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.080]   sell us products and stuff that we knew we didn't need
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.520]   because we were great do-it-yourselfers.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.020]   So, I decided to go back to school for fun
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.180]   to learn about financial planning for me
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.380]   and for my husband, and I fell in love with it,
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.800]   and I saw this huge need for people getting advice,
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.020]   and at first, I was just going to take care of my ER buddies
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.160]   and my running buddies. I'm a runner,
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.540]   and then it just, like -- I started a firm in 2004,
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.300]   and I was going to practice emergency medicine part-time,
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.140]   financial planning part-time,
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.080]   and then it just kind of exploded,
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.440]   but plus, I found out I was the lowest-paid person
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.420]   in our practice, emergency medicine practice,
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.220]   and I was the only woman, and I'm like,
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.620]   "I am tired of this BS," so I left medicine,
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.000]   and so I had my financial planning practice,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.260]   and all of a sudden, I had all these wonderful people
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.860]   from NAPFA and stuff that helped me get started
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.540]   and understand how to be a real financial planner,
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.940]   and so all of a sudden, I started recognizing
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.060]   all these intersections of health and finance.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.100]   Like, people don't know how to plan for chronic illness.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.240]   How do you help uninsurable clients get health insurance?
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.380]   This was back before the ACA, so I started putting together
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.580]   all these fun talks before you know it.
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.460]   I realized there is some stuff I know
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.180]   that could really help both professions,
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.820]   so I'm really honored that I get to do this work.
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.020]   I feel like it's my true calling,
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.960]   and one of the things -- so my practice
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.860]   is fee-only fiduciary practice.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.500]   We don't try -- and I'm just telling you about my practice
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.500]   so you understand my mindset. I hated AUM because it's like,
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.940]   "We are real financial planners.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.620]   Why are we charging people based on assets?"
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.660]   So I was one of the early pioneers
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.540]   of doing flat-feed planning, which I'm really excited
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.340]   because that is starting to blossom,
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.340]   and there are more flat-feed planners out there,
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.540]   but I developed all this great clientele through the years,
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.020]   and we started recognizing --
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.900]   and we started getting a lot of do-it-yourselfers
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.540]   who realized that they needed help.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.260]   They'd become too complicated to do it themselves well,
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260]   or they were getting into trouble,
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.940]   and so I have lots of stories to tell you
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.260]   because, you know, doing it yourself is great.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.300]   I was a do-it-yourselfer,
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.980]   and I want to go through how much should you do yourself,
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.100]   and then when should you get help,
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.260]   and then how and where to get help.
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.820]   So we are going to start with a quiz.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.740]   I'm going to have everybody raise their hand.
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.660]   These are -- you know, people think of financial planning
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.700]   as investments, and Boagleheads, you guys all love investment
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.900]   stuff, and I know you talk about tax.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.300]   You talk about estate,
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.780]   but you're trying to do it all yourself.
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.060]   I want to see how much you guys are really doing.
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.780]   How many of you do all your cash flow and budgeting?
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.900]   That's the easy part, right?
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.060]   And you planned out your cash flows for the next
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.220]   however many years of your living in retirement.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.140]   Raise your hands if you've done that.
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.140]   Good. How many of you do your own taxes?
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.900]   Oh, how many of you do your own tax planning?
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.580]   Very different.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.180]   Wow. How many of you feel really good about your insurance
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.140]   and your asset protection?
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.900]   Less hands, but still enough.
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.900]   How many of you have -- do not have an estate plan,
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.700]   or you've done your estate plan using internet-based resources?
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.940]   How many of you have used an attorney --
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.980]   how many of you have used an attorney to do your estate plan?
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.460]   Okay. Some hands aren't missing, and it's probably the ones
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.580]   who are embarrassed to tell us they haven't done an estate plan.
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.940]   Okay. And this one, I'm pretty much sure I know the answer.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.660]   How many of you do all your own investing?
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.980]   Okay. Okay. Now, let's start.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.260]   What I'm going to take you through is all the poops I see,
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.780]   right, of each of these sections.
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.340]   So cash flow planning.
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.860]   Everybody should be able to do this, and thank goodness,
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.420]   financial literacy is improving, but not fast enough.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.340]   And so what do I see people get in trouble with?
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.460]   They're not paying attention to their statements.
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.260]   Everything is internet-based.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.060]   Now all your statements are online.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.220]   So how often do you really look at them?
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.700]   I see people with duplicate subscriptions
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.100]   or subscriptions they don't use, fraud that they haven't caught,
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.980]   that the banks haven't caught.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.740]   So it's really important to pay attention to your statements.
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.740]   The other thing is people don't ever download their statements.
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.460]   And if you get into an accident, or if you die, and your family has
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.380]   to pay the bills, and you don't have anybody else on the account,
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.420]   what happens to those accounts?
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.700]   They're frozen.
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.500]   And not only are they frozen, you're not going to be able
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.020]   to access them online, so your family's not going to know when
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.500]   and what bills need to be paid.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.780]   So having too many accounts, you know, you see this great yield
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.180]   at this account, this great yield at this account.
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.540]   Oh, this beautiful credit card.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.380]   Before you know it, you have five, 10, 15 statements.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.100]   The estate planning attorneys will love you when you die,
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.060]   because now you've got to clean up all that mess
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.780]   if you have multiple accounts.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.380]   Poor social security claiming strategies.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.660]   People don't understand.
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.940]   It's not just about you.
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.380]   It's you and your spouse.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.140]   And people don't think through good income planning
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.860]   so that they can delay social security
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.500]   to when it's most beneficial for them to take it.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.260]   A lot of people say, "Government's going to run out of money."
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.940]   Government will not run out of money.
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.220]   It can't. It creates the money, right?
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.620]   We do have to have some tax issues around that.
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.300]   But social security's not going to go away.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.100]   Too many people claim way too early, mostly out of fear,
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.660]   and they don't have anybody else to talk them out of it.
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.820]   And the big one is they don't notice they're slipping.
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:26.300]   So I had a 90-year-old client, and he was very good
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.020]   about paying his bills.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.060]   And he got his credit card statement every month.
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.980]   He looked at how much he would spend,
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.740]   and he would send the credit card people a check.
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.940]   This is -- he was getting paper statements.
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.860]   And somewhere along the line, he had started automatic bill pay.
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.500]   So he was paying this credit card every month by check.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.660]   They were also deducting stuff automatically.
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.460]   And before you know it -- and the son finally caught it.
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.740]   He had a $2,000 credit card balance of money he could spend.
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.740]   And it's like, "Okay, this guy could die any day.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.940]   It's hard to get money out of the credit card."
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.660]   So they had a big family outing at Maggiano's
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.340]   when all the grandkids and kids came down,
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.180]   and they spent the entire $2,000.
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.220]   But the son looked at -- kept up with him going forward
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.420]   because we didn't -- the slip was a gradual decline.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.940]   Tax plan -- a prep.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.020]   And tax planning software makes it easy,
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.980]   but when do people get in trouble?
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.100]   When they have self-employment income or business income.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.620]   A lot of people miss deductions.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.220]   A big one I see is the health insurance deduction.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.300]   You know, if you're self-employed and on Medicare,
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:39.020]   you can deduct Medicare premiums from your self-employment income.
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.580]   So, you know, there are a lot of little tax things
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.620]   that people don't understand that they deduct,
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.980]   so they miss a lot of things.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.900]   Alternative investments, to me, just create a mess with --
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.500]   and I'm speaking to the choir here, though --
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.900]   mess with your taxes, because now you've got to wait on your K-1s.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.820]   You've got to make sure your K-1s are appropriately put in.
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.140]   Too much trading.
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.620]   Had a do-it-yourselfer who came to me.
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.700]   His Schedule D was 10 pages long.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.540]   You got -- the people who do taxes are --
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.060]   you guys understand what happened there?
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.220]   He was trading, trading, trading,
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.700]   wash sales, crazy stuff going on.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.060]   So, thank goodness he didn't -- he did himself quite well,
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.900]   but he was in a lucky moment.
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.020]   But his taxes were a mess.
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.340]   Multiple income streams.
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.180]   A lot of times people are -- you know, that have two jobs
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.260]   or two spouses have jobs.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.580]   They're not withholding the amount,
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.860]   especially if you have great investments
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.380]   that are kicking off income,
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.900]   because you're not tax-efficient with your investments.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.540]   Then you don't do enough withholding.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.740]   Now, how many of you here know what a 8606 is?
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.100]   Part of -- okay, great.
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.660]   So, when you do IRA contributions,
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.420]   non-deductible IRA contributions,
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.740]   or any contributions, Roth conversions,
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.660]   it gets recorded on Form 8606.
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.340]   How many of you have had more
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.220]   than one accountant in your lifetime?
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.380]   For those who don't do their taxes, some say, well,
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.380]   I'm my own accountant, so I don't mess up.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.060]   Well, what happens is, if you change accountants,
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.100]   oftentimes the -- if you were doing non-deductible IRA
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.180]   contributions, 8606 tracks your basis in your IRA.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.820]   So, when you do that Roth conversion, you don't have to --
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.700]   or you pull money out of your IRA, you don't have to pay taxes
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.380]   on that post-tax money.
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.580]   Well, if you don't keep up with 8606s, that gets lost.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.020]   And so, I've had clients that have had, you know, 40, 50,
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.780]   $60,000 in IRA contributions they made in the past,
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.340]   or post-tax, that got lost because they changed accountants,
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.820]   and it wasn't in the old accounting software.
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.660]   We've even had clients who kept the same accountants,
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.220]   and the accountants got new accounting software,
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.220]   and the new accounting software didn't carry
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.340]   over the old 8606s.
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.460]   So, it's -- it can be a mess.
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.380]   And then, finally, again, I'm going to say this over and over,
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.700]   and I'm going to get deeper into this.
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.620]   Cognitive decline is an issue.
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.100]   Now, tax planning, biggest mistakes I see.
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.380]   Not utilizing lower tax brackets for income and capital gains.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.340]   How many of you are really good at this?
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.540]   Ooh, not many hands.
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.940]   Okay, nothing breaks my heart more than to see a tax return
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.300]   with negative income.
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.740]   You know, it's like you've had so many deductions that you go,
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.140]   "Oh, my tax is zero.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.060]   I'm so excited.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.100]   My negative income is 20,000."
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.420]   What have you done there?
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.500]   You missed out on tax-free Roth conversions,
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.540]   or IRA distributions if you need the money, whatever.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:37.380]   And so, it's important to call the age 60 to 70 the golden age
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.260]   of tax planning for retirement,
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.580]   because that's when you're not taking Social Security yet.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.140]   You don't have required distributions yet.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.100]   You might not -- if you're an early retiree,
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.940]   you might not have a lot of income.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.780]   You might be in the 10% tax bracket.
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:56.180]   You can take capital gains, 0% capital gains tax rate
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.060]   up to when you're through the 12% bracket.
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.900]   And so, I see so many people missing
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.540]   out on these tax planning opportunities
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.620]   in those early years of retirement.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.100]   Also, for people who need health insurance, ACA tax credits.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.100]   If you do great income planning, you can get health insurance
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.060]   from age 60 to 65 for nothing.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.300]   Great health insurance.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.420]   A tax credit's worth $20,000 if you do good income planning.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.380]   A lot of people don't know this.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.300]   So, miscalculating retirement plan distributions.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.460]   People have multiple jobs now, so they'll retire with 403(b),
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.060]   another 401(k).
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.740]   They have three IRAs.
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.980]   Well, some -- everybody knows that you can take --
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.420]   you can lump all your IRA distributions for your RMDs
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.100]   and take them from one IRA, but you can't do
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.780]   that for 403(b)s and 401(k)s.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.660]   So, making mistakes on that, and that creates a nightmare.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.340]   Making inappropriate contributions.
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.100]   Just had a new client come to us recently.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.500]   Been making Roth contributions for a few years now,
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.140]   and his income is $400,000 a year.
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.660]   Yep. Got to do some unwinding there.
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.260]   I'm like, "Oh, I hate to tell you this."
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.660]   I love when I can tell people good news.
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.540]   I hate the bad news, but he won't do it going forward.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.100]   Not keeping up with basis.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.220]   How many of you have stocks or mutual funds
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.180]   where you don't know the basis?
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.460]   Not many, but the good news is, is the rules changed recently,
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.900]   so all the reporting, all the mutual funds
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.820]   and the custodians have to help you keep up with basis.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.260]   That wasn't so, but a lot of people will have old stocks
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.340]   where they don't know basis, and so --
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.100]   especially we have one client who had this stock.
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.300]   We kept bugging him to get basis for us.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.540]   Well, the company was bought out and sold,
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:48.260]   and his shares were forced sale, basically,
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.340]   and now we have this $64,000 capital gain
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.380]   that he didn't know basis.
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.780]   Painful, painful, painful.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.540]   You see this a lot with employee stock,
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.980]   because they didn't do a good job keeping
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.100]   up with basis during employee stock.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.260]   Poor charitable planning.
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.020]   Breaks my heart when I see people, they're giving away
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.860]   like $10,000 a year using cash.
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.780]   You know, maybe they get $10,000 property tax deduction,
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.820]   income tax deduction, because the SALT caps.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.100]   So they're getting -- they have $20,000 of deduction a year,
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.380]   and then they end up having to take the standard deduction,
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.340]   because it's under standard deduction.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.620]   Well, let's say you're age 60, and you give $10,000 a year away,
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.900]   and you have some appreciated stock.
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.420]   Well, you could take $100,000 of appreciated stock.
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.300]   You don't have to pay the capital gains taxes.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.940]   You can put it in donor-advised fund.
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.940]   You get a big write-off that year.
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.380]   You can either take -- do Roth conversions,
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.580]   take capital gains, you name it.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.020]   You can use that, and then you get the standard deduction
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.860]   the rest of the time.
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.020]   You saved a load in taxes.
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.940]   So these are the things do-it-yourselfers don't think
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.340]   about, gifting inappropriately.
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.980]   People have -- and I've already heard it.
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.300]   I love this audience.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.180]   You know, I was on the panel this morning.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.700]   A lot of you guys have already told me some great stories
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.140]   throughout the day, and I hear a lot about like gift --
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.060]   you know, I have all this appreciated stock.
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.260]   What do I do with it?
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.700]   Give it to your children who are in low tax brackets.
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.820]   Let them sell it.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.580]   Sometimes they can sell it at 0% capital gains rate.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.380]   Great way to gift.
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.300]   Also, you can -- the other gifting mistake I see, oh,
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.060]   I have a lot of money.
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.420]   I want to help my children buy a house.
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.740]   So you just give them $200,000.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.180]   Well, most likely, because the IRS is so busy that you're --
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.700]   they're not going to get in trouble with that,
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.340]   but let's say they change the estate tax laws,
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.060]   and now our estate tax exemption is lower.
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.100]   If you didn't document that correctly,
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.580]   that could cause problems down the line.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.460]   So, have I hit any buttons yet?
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.780]   We'll wait until we get to the investments.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.700]   Insurance, you know, people who are do-it-yourselfers,
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.860]   two reasons people do it themselves.
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:01.860]   They don't trust people, or they're cheap, right?
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.620]   And the problem with when you're cheap, you also tend to be cheap
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.620]   across the board, so you don't buy enough insurance.
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:11.300]   Nothing breaks my heart than seeing people
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.940]   who have a few million dollars in unprotected assets,
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.780]   and they have the minimum underlying coverage
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.060]   on their auto liability.
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.260]   I mean, in Florida, that's a nightmare.
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.220]   And, man, you could get sued in a heartbeat.
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.860]   There's a reason O.J. Simpson --
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.220]   well, there's a lot of old people in here.
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.580]   I'm old, so I can say that.
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.580]   You guys remember O.J. Simpson and all that?
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.900]   So, what's the first thing he did when he got in trouble?
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.180]   What did he go do?
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.940]   He bought a big, huge mansion in Florida.
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.540]   I'm from Florida.
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.340]   And the reason he did that is
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.060]   that home is 100% protected from creditors.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.340]   Every state's different.
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.100]   Florida's just very good about creditor protection.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.060]   But some people forget to homestead,
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.060]   so you lose that creditor protection.
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.260]   So, you've got to make sure your home is protected
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.740]   by homesteading it.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.940]   Inappropriate titling of assets.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.940]   You know, people will buy a car.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.300]   You really -- if you buy a car, the primary driver
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.260]   of the car should be the only owner of the car.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.660]   Don't, like, put it jointly,
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.940]   because it's going to be easier later, because that just opens
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.220]   up everybody to being sued if that car's in a wreck.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.060]   Or, you know, having things joint tenants
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.460]   by entirety makes it less likely
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.100]   that those assets will be taken by creditors.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.780]   Estate planning.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.540]   You know, so many people raise their hand
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.260]   that they did their estate plans, which excites me.
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.300]   If you look at the data, there's, you know,
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.620]   all these different studies.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:42.540]   But anywhere from 50 to 67% of people don't have estate plans.
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.020]   So, you guys are doing better than average,
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.660]   which is what I'd expect.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:50.020]   Now, I do not like using internet-based documents.
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.340]   And why is that?
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.860]   You guys, I have talked so much today.
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.380]   It's been so fun and exciting.
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.100]   I'm losing my voice, so I apologize.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.220]   I'm just going to hold on to this.
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.060]   If I've had this happen two times now,
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.380]   how many of you have ever had a power of attorney document turned
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.180]   down by a financial institution?
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.820]   Right. And so, the problem, they're very persnickety.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.540]   And if you have done your power of attorney document
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:20.820]   through internet-based service or through some legal Zoom sort
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.340]   of thing or whatever, how, who do you have to stand up for you?
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.620]   Is it Mr. Google?
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.220]   No, nobody.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.620]   And that's why, to me, it's really important for you guys
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.900]   to use real people to do your estate planning documents
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.500]   and your power of attorney documents.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.380]   Because if you get in trouble, and I've had this happen,
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.900]   I call up Mr. Attorney, and I say, "Mr. Attorney,
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.740]   bank is turning down this perfectly legal,
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.140]   valid power of attorney that you did."
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.340]   And he writes nasty gram to the bank.
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.460]   "We will sue your butt off if you do not accept this."
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.820]   And what does the bank do?
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.300]   They accept it.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.460]   So, pay the couple hundred bucks to get a real power
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.500]   of attorney done or, you know, the $1,500
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.500]   if your situation is simple.
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.340]   You know, if it's more complicated,
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.620]   you're going to pay more.
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.780]   Pay the money to get good estate planning documents done.
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.620]   Now, here's the other big mistake.
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.940]   I think everybody says, "Oh, I left all this money
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.340]   to my children through my will."
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.100]   Well, how do assets pass?
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.900]   They pass three ways.
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.180]   First is titling.
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.220]   If you own something jointly with Rights of Survivorship,
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.780]   it goes to the survivor, right?
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.940]   It doesn't go through your will.
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.500]   For your IRAs, life insurance, annuities,
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.500]   ideally you have beneficiaries listed.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.820]   If not, they'll go through your will,
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.700]   but now you have probate issues.
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.740]   So, ideally you should have beneficiaries
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.860]   to all these things.
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.100]   You should have all your copies of your beneficiaries on file,
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.220]   and you should understand how much everybody's going to get.
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.620]   Sometimes people have different beneficiaries on the documents
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.820]   than the way they're passing things through the will,
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.020]   and they don't understand
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.380]   that people are going to get different amounts of money.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.860]   So, make sure you understand
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.580]   exactly how everything is going to pass
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.460]   and that everything is titled correctly.
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.380]   One other titling mistake I see,
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.220]   people go to their estate planning attorney,
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.700]   and they create these beautiful trusts,
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.700]   and then they don't do anything with them.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.460]   They forget to title the assets to the trust,
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.380]   and you don't have a trust.
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.900]   A trust doesn't work if you don't title the assets.
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.580]   So, this is one big story.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.180]   Client of mine was going to be the executor
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:33.460]   for his dad's estate, and his dad was 94.
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.140]   Dad, we knew, had a lot of money.
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.340]   We just didn't know how much because dad was very secretive,
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.540]   and he had done well,
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.500]   and he did not like financial advisors
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.060]   because they were all schmucks,
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.780]   but son had no clue what his dad had.
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.340]   I said, "You're going to have a hot mess on your hands.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.620]   I promise you."
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.620]   So, he told dad, "My financial advisor
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.700]   happens to help make sure old people stay out of trouble.
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.420]   She's not going to charge you a thing.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.300]   She's just going to do it as a learning thing for me
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.220]   because I need to understand what you have
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.980]   because I don't know what you have."
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.940]   He said, "Okay, bring her on," the 94-year-old did.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.620]   So, I meet with him. He's very proud of how well he did.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.500]   Six million dollars. That was his estate.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.580]   Four million in taxable accounts,
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.140]   two million in retirement plans.
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.340]   He says, "I have done my trust."
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.180]   I'm like, "Oh, great. Show me your trust."
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.060]   His trust, all his beneficiaries were his sons.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.220]   He left tiny amounts to his grandkids,
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.500]   and he left about --
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.260]   it was going to end up being about two million bucks,
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.580]   half of the taxable estate to charity.
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.140]   Very charitable.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.540]   And so, I said, "Show me your assets," and guess what?
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.860]   He had 40 different stocks in street name.
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.300]   Do you guys know what that means?
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.500]   At the actual holding companies,
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.740]   he owned them all individually.
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.300]   He still had some old stock certificates.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.460]   That is an estate-planning nightmare.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.100]   Do I have an estate-planning attorney in here?
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.180]   Is there? Are there any?
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.380]   None. I'm sad.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.780]   They will stand up and say, "That's a nightmare.
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.780]   That's going to be expensive probate,
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.460]   hours and hours of work."
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.620]   And so, it was not titled to his trust,
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.860]   so he'd have to go to probate to go to his trust.
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.300]   So, what are the mistakes there?
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.100]   Anybody shout out one big mistake you hear?
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.180]   Charities listed in trust.
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.580]   Oh, the IRA beneficiaries were his sons.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:28.500]   So, if the way he left it is the charity
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.820]   would get assets in the trust,
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.140]   sons would get IRAs that have to pay taxes on them.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.500]   And so happened, his retirement plans were $2 million.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.780]   So, what we ended up doing is we amended his trust
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.020]   to get, and all his grandkids were going to get like 10,000,
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.620]   and we'd mine it in small amounts.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.660]   And it's like, why are they even listed in the documents?
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.100]   And so, what we ended up doing is had his trust redone,
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:57.380]   named his sons the beneficiaries of the trust,
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.140]   and then we moved all those assets into a brokerage,
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.140]   all those stocks or industry names,
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.100]   into a brokerage account titled to his trust,
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.340]   and then we made the IRAs the beneficiary,
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.340]   the beneficiaries were the charities,
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.820]   because the charities don't have to pay tax on the IRAs.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:19.580]   So, that saved that family about $600,000 in income tax.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.700]   And oh, by the way, the guys told me,
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.180]   we've got plenty of time to deal with this,
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.340]   I'm gonna live till I'm 105.
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:31.460]   He died the year after we cleaned everything up.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.540]   Family loved me.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.660]   Now, so these are the things people don't know
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.920]   when you're a do-it-yourselfer,
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.220]   and especially when you start getting too complicated.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.980]   Investments, I've heard this in this room.
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.740]   So many questions are just like,
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.300]   you guys are doing a great job managing your investments,
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.540]   but too many people don't understand
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.260]   the goals for their money.
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.140]   It's like, how much do you really need?
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.180]   Are you taking the appropriate amount of risk?
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.140]   It killed me in 2008, the number of people,
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.900]   once 2009 hit, that were aggressively invested
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.020]   because the stock market was doing so great,
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.180]   and they had to un-retire.
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.460]   Those weren't my clients, by the way.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.780]   They became my clients after 2009, right?
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.180]   And so not understanding how much risk
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.140]   you can take in your portfolio
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.020]   that's going to keep you financially secure
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.460]   so you don't run out of money.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.660]   Poor tax management, we already talked about.
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.860]   You know, people owning bonds in the Roths.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.440]   I know you guys don't do stuff like that.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.420]   Please tell me no.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.000]   And owning like REITs and taxable accounts.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.860]   So we see a lot of unnecessary tax things in portfolios.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.540]   Too many accounts, not simplifying.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.420]   We already talked about the titling,
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.060]   not keeping up with basis.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.540]   And again, not addressing cognitive decline.
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.520]   So I know none of you are going to confess
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.860]   if you do any of this, but if you do,
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.460]   you need to get help.
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.540]   So when should you get help?
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:49.540]   Three situations.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.120]   I call these the poop piles.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.600]   I'm a doctor.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.380]   I do talk a lot about inappropriate things.
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.480]   So Christine knows that.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.740]   She's heard me talk quite a few times.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.380]   Three poop piles are,
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.420]   if you have a complicated financial situation,
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.180]   if someone is counting on you,
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.420]   and you're the only one who knows everything going on,
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.780]   and if you're starting to slip.
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.580]   And the problem is people who are starting to slip
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.020]   know they're starting to slip,
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.460]   but they think they're doing better
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.140]   than they're really doing.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.680]   This is just a fact.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.500]   So are you complicated?
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.780]   First off, what are your skillsets?
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.140]   You may be very good at investing,
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.140]   but maybe it's really hard to know everything.
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.300]   Once you start getting a million dollars,
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.220]   two million dollars,
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.900]   which is what you need for a successful retirement
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.140]   for most people.
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.540]   I mean, as far as if you want to not have to
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.860]   just rely on social security.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.540]   You can maybe manage those assets,
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:45.100]   but do you know how to withdraw them tax efficiently?
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.620]   Do you have everything titled correctly?
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.680]   It's good to have somebody look from the outside,
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.380]   just make sure that you have all your ducks in a row,
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.760]   that all the puzzle pieces fit together.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.660]   'Cause you don't know what you don't know.
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.400]   Like my client didn't know he made too much money
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.060]   to contribute to a Roth.
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.260]   He had a lot of money too.
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.700]   So it was amazing.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.540]   I'm like, whew.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.660]   So consider getting an hourly planner
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.980]   just to look at your big picture.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.240]   And I would caution you.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.140]   I mean, the distribution phase,
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.820]   accumulation is easy.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:17.820]   You guys know that.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.580]   It's the distribution phase
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.300]   that can get a little challenging.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.980]   And so, yeah, you can learn it all.
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.260]   And I have clients,
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.460]   they could seriously be financial planners.
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.740]   They're so good,
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.740]   but it's really important to be smart
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.020]   and have somebody else looking behind you
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.600]   to make sure you know what you don't,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.940]   that they can help you identify what you don't know
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.640]   during that distribution phase.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.620]   Now, if someone else is counting on you,
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.420]   I break this into two buckets,
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.100]   the spouse that have the skills.
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.780]   So like in my family,
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.000]   who takes care of the finances in my family?
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.580]   My husband, 'cause I'm too busy, he deals with it.
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.280]   But I know everything going on.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.220]   I know how to get in the accounts.
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.300]   I do, I can look at our cashflow and stuff
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.340]   'cause we use a portal.
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.480]   I can look at anything, any time.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.200]   And we check in to make sure
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.160]   I know how to log into everything.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.120]   Especially with two-factor authentication in the phone,
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.900]   you guys need to know how to log into each other's phones.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.480]   I had one client that I went to their house,
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.180]   their caretaker that was paying all the bills,
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.420]   it was his sister, they were very close.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.240]   And lo and behold, his phone,
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.060]   the only way you could get into it
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.620]   and he had everything in two-factor authentication
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.540]   was a thumbprint.
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.020]   I'm like, okay, you're, and he was on his deathbed.
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.740]   I was going, I mean, going to make sure
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:42.260]   we had everything titled up, I mean, tidied up.
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.580]   And I'm like, oh my God, we can't,
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.260]   we don't have your thumb when you're dead.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.220]   So we were at last minute trying to,
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.700]   we had to get his phone
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.680]   to where his sister could get into it.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:56.060]   So it's those things you gotta make sure that every,
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:59.340]   there's somebody that knows how to get to your stuff.
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.720]   Now, if your spouse or the people looking after you
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.400]   does not have, don't have the skills,
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.380]   you gotta have still, I call them yearly audits,
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.460]   at least once a year, check in and make sure they know
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.580]   how to at least get into everything,
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.780]   but have a good backup plan
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.500]   who also knows how to take care of everything.
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.220]   And I always make our spouses learn
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.920]   how to at least know what bills need to be paid,
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.140]   how to pay the bills, log into the accounts,
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.700]   and that they understand the very big picture
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.300]   of their investments and finances.
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:36.000]   You guys, I'm gonna be really cooked by tomorrow morning
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.460]   how much I've been talking to you.
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.140]   So I might have to have Grand Marnier tonight
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.340]   to keep my throat going.
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:45.500]   So I, and I'm gonna, a quick story on this one.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.400]   I had a client, and this is actually what sent me
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.500]   on this journey of having people plan for aging
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.340]   in serious health events.
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.020]   I had a client who had lung cancer,
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.800]   diagnosed in his early 50s, had a wife.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.980]   Wife was oblivious to anything,
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.860]   and he had a very complicated situation.
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.200]   And when he was diagnosed, he says,
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.320]   "Carolyn, I'm gonna beat it.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.020]   "Doctor and me knows the prognosis."
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.900]   You know, so I'm, let me say, helping him plan
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.500]   and not taking his hope away.
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.320]   I said, "You gotta teach your wife how to, like,
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.380]   "at least pay the bills."
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.220]   So he says, "I'm gonna do that.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.820]   "I'll make sure she knows how to pay the bills."
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.080]   I said, "Because at least when you're going
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.300]   "through treatment, she can lift some load."
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.740]   And she promised me that she would learn how to pay bills,
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.860]   'cause I always talk to both clients.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.260]   And so, every month or two, I'd ask,
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.300]   "How's the bill pay come along?"
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.420]   And she would say to me,
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.220]   "He's getting really frustrated with me."
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.540]   I get a call from her saying,
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.760]   "Joe is in the driveway having a seizure,
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.940]   "and he won't go to the hospital."
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.660]   You know, 'cause he'd come out of the seizure.
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.580]   And so I actually drive over there,
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.580]   and I know, because I'm a doctor,
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.860]   that his lung cancer's probably gone to his brain,
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.820]   'cause that's why he's having the seizure.
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.500]   And I get over there, and he's in his office
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.460]   on his day bed, and he's rocking,
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.300]   'cause he has a big headache.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.780]   And I'm saying, "You really gotta go to the hospital.
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:58.980]   "We gotta get you there."
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.340]   And I happened to see this pile of unopened mail
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.260]   on his desk.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.100]   What was it?
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.500]   The bills.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.660]   I said, "What are those bills?"
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.020]   I hadn't had a chance to get to 'em.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.420]   They had not been paid in a couple of months.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.640]   I mean, this was a guy who was so on it.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.220]   And so I'm like, "Whew."
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.380]   And so I said, "We're going to the hospital."
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.420]   Scooped up, got the wife, scooped up the bills.
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.620]   I said, "Get the checkbook."
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.340]   At least I knew she was on the checkbook.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.460]   And so while we're in the emergency room,
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.180]   I am having her write out the bills
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.980]   while we're trying to get him settled.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.140]   And that shouldn't happen.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.340]   And that's what put me on this mission.
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.260]   So, last one, are you slipping?
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:40.740]   So with aging, we do face, our brain slows down a little bit.
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.680]   We can't make decisions as fast as we used to.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.940]   But thank goodness, with aging comes wisdom.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.460]   So most people are able to at least slow down,
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.920]   think through things, know what's not right.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.980]   But this is how fraudsters get to you.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.600]   They prey on, by pressuring you,
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.920]   trying to get you to make quick decisions,
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.620]   and operating on fear, which as you get older
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.340]   and you become more concrete in your thinking,
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.920]   it's easier to prey on your fear.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.060]   So that's normal aging.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:13.100]   About 12 to 18% of people over 60
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.420]   develop what's called mild cognitive impairment.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.640]   That means you can function day to day,
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.480]   but you may need some assistive devices
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.540]   in keeping you from forgetting things,
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.060]   like making lists, or having reminders.
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:29.420]   So, and most people with mild cognitive impairment
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.700]   stay stable and do fine until they die,
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.220]   but 10 to 20% go on to develop dementia.
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.260]   Now, dementia, the risk of that doubles
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.700]   every five years over age 60.
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.980]   So people age 65 to 69, 3% have dementia.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.940]   By the time you're over 90, 35% have dementia.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:49.140]   Problem is, and I have dealt with this over and over,
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.780]   when you're in the throes of having
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.180]   mild cognitive impairment or dementia,
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.500]   you think you're better than you are,
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.220]   and you may know you have dementia,
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.660]   and you do, when you're officially diagnosed,
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.980]   it's devastating, but you think you're functioning,
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.680]   and you're not as well as you should be.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.500]   And so it's really important to plan well in advance
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.820]   before the event happens.
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.860]   So what we actually do with clients
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.240]   when they're in their late 50s, early 60s,
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.320]   we have what we call an aging plan,
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.780]   and it's where we go through what I call
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.600]   the four big things of aging.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.500]   When, where are you gonna age,
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.300]   and when are you gonna move to where
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.500]   if it's no longer safe to age in place where you are?
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.420]   When are you gonna turn over financial decision making?
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.860]   When are you gonna get help with healthcare decision making,
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.240]   and when are you gonna quit driving?
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.740]   Driving's a big one, isn't it?
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:42.180]   Now, when you do that when somebody's well,
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.580]   it takes the fear factor out,
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.100]   and no, 'cause nobody, they're not defensive,
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.340]   they're not worried, oh, they think
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.540]   there's a problem with me.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.500]   When you make that standard process,
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.900]   it creates muscle memory for, oh, we talked about this,
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.100]   and if you talk about it every few years,
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.300]   it makes it where people are more comfortable
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.460]   when the poop actually hits the fan,
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.900]   sticking with the plan of what you agreed on
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.340]   when you're in your late 50s, early 60s.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.800]   And now that I've been doing this,
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.060]   I started that aging planning in 2009
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.340]   after I had a big client event that it's like,
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:15.560]   oh, we gotta do better planning for dementia.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.800]   And now I actually have had clients
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.840]   who've gone through the aging plan,
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.500]   and now they have cognitive impairment or dementia.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.540]   It has worked wonderfully.
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.260]   Now, and it's still agonizing
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.860]   when you're diagnosed with dementia,
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.500]   and it's still painful, but everybody follows the plan.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.780]   'Cause part of that process is we also start
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.340]   involving the healthcare surrogates
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:39.340]   and the financial surrogates long before a need ever arises.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.160]   So what we do is if you are slipping,
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.700]   you always have a backup.
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.180]   You do yearly audits with your backup,
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.480]   and at some point you allow them to observe
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.060]   what you're doing, and you may wanna involve a planner.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.220]   Now, when do you get help?
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.380]   Where do you get help?
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:01.020]   So if you have financially adept children,
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:03.660]   and I met a couple, a mother and son here earlier
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.620]   just delighted my heart that he's actually getting,
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.260]   she actually made him come here, I think.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:14.260]   But for families to start that financial education early
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.940]   and to start help getting the kids involved
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.060]   so they understand what they're gonna be taking over.
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.520]   But, and then the other option is you have outside parties.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.140]   I think of a financial planner as a quarterback
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.500]   to help with all the situations,
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.820]   and you wanna make sure that you have
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.040]   an accountant and attorney that understands your situation.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.140]   The more people you have involved,
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.300]   the less chance something nefarious will occur,
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.700]   because people have to stay on their P's and Q's
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.680]   when everybody knows what's going on.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.700]   So if you're using family members or friends,
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.500]   create transparency with everybody.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.520]   So it may be one child in charge,
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.820]   but you wanna make sure that they're reporting
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.500]   to the other kids, and the other kids know all the finances
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.980]   and they know the plan.
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.620]   Again, it reduced the chances of nefarious things,
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:05.540]   and it lets the other kids know that, hey,
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.940]   brother has it, and he's doing okay,
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.900]   'cause we can see everything all along the way.
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.780]   Make sure everybody's on the same page.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.500]   So perfect example I had, I have one client,
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:19.580]   Boglehead, and he loves our passive investing style.
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:23.540]   His son-in-law, who's an amazing young man,
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.820]   still thinks he can beat the market.
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.420]   You know, you know how you are when you're young.
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:33.420]   And I said to the father-in-law, my client,
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.980]   I'm a little worried that he might try
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.100]   to change what we're doing if something happens to you,
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.220]   'cause his client's getting really on up there.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.020]   And he says, we're gonna have a conversation.
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.040]   So the three of us had a meeting,
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.180]   and my client basically said to his son-in-law,
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.860]   who's gonna be his financial surrogate,
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.500]   don't change anything I'm doing.
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.860]   And then the rest of the family knows that same thing.
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.820]   So we made sure everybody's on the same page,
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.860]   and the son-in-law said, I promise I will never do that.
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.780]   And so consider also involving an outside party,
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.740]   like a financial planner, the accountant,
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.300]   or attorney, to keep the peace.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:08.580]   Advisors, thank goodness things have changed so much
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.900]   from when I started.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.500]   Make sure that you use a fee-only fiduciary.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.980]   And you know, for most bogey heads,
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.180]   you're gonna do best with somebody
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.940]   who's hourly or flat fee.
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.220]   Not a fan of AUM, of course,
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.100]   'cause I don't think it's fair for people
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.180]   to have a lot of money.
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.860]   And I don't think financial planning
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.680]   should be paid for based on assets.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.180]   But more and more advisors are moving
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.500]   towards having financial planning fees
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.740]   with tiny asset management fees.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.060]   Those may be okay, but for people who are just charging,
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.420]   you know, one, one and a half percent AUM,
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.580]   and they're doing financial planning under it,
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.540]   most of 'em are not focusing on the financial planning.
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.940]   Where do you find 'em?
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.780]   These are all organizations
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.740]   that only accept fee-only fiduciaries.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:56.800]   Make sure that your accountant and attorney
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.240]   will work with your financial planner.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.880]   And the reason why is if they're not working as a team,
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.480]   then there may be holes that you can't identify.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.800]   So if I have an accountant,
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.880]   I mean a client whose accountant or attorney
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.240]   won't work with me, I say,
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.320]   I don't really like your accountant or attorney,
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.960]   the fact that they won't work with me,
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.560]   so you either need to talk with them or we need to change.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.320]   And most often, they change.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.200]   So that's, professional fiduciary,
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.920]   some states have those available, like California.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.600]   So if you don't have anybody else to help you,
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.480]   that's how you might wanna do it.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.800]   And then finally, turning over duties.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.360]   Especially do-it-yourselfers,
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.520]   it's such a sense of purpose and accomplishment
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.000]   when you're doing it yourself.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.160]   It can be devastating to all of a sudden just say,
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.320]   I gotta give this up.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.120]   So you make it a transition.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.840]   And I've already talked about that,
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.040]   but make sure, talk about it early
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:53.600]   and make that transition last as long as possible.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.880]   So in summary,
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.560]   and I think we have five minutes for questions,
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.360]   biggest danger to financial well-being
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.080]   is not fraud or abuse.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.560]   Just a reminder though,
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:06.400]   90% of financial fraud is done by friends and family.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.320]   So that's why you need to have multiple people involved,
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.840]   but the bigger dollars are stolen by the other 10%,
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.960]   just so you know.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.960]   But the biggest danger to your financial well-being
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:20.720]   is the person who fails to recognize
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.600]   that they have limitations and they refuse to get help.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.280]   Being a do-it-yourselfer is great
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.720]   as long as you plan for the day
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.760]   you can no longer do it yourself.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.160]   And now we'll do some questions.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.400]   Yep.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.240]   I'm gonna stand over here
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.480]   'cause I know you're gonna use that microphone.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.720]   - Thank you, Carolyn, that was great.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.560]   One sec.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.560]   Okay, now.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.840]   So let's do this lightning round style
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.520]   'cause we have to get through a lot.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.800]   So first question,
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.840]   how do you recommend handling a parent
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.680]   who is slipping cognitively
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.520]   who does not recognize that they are having the decline?
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.400]   - Well, again, the first thing is
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.680]   you should have those conversations
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.600]   long before they're ever slipping.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.760]   But once they are slipping,
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.880]   you have to remember there comes a point
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.960]   where the child has to be the parent.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.720]   And you just have to say I'm really worried about you
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.440]   and I think that you may be having challenges
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.840]   and say, would you mind undergoing testing
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.720]   just to make sure there's nothing going on
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.080]   that we don't know about?
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.480]   If you have objective testing saying you're fine,
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.720]   we're gonna feel good.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.480]   If you're not fine, then we know
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.960]   we need to start putting in protections to help you.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.120]   - Okay, great.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.400]   Is there a particular age or life stage
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.920]   when DIY investors tend to make mistakes?
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.400]   I think I heard you say that the incidents
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.880]   tends to pick up as we age.
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.480]   - Well, it starts to pick up more
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.800]   when you're moving from accumulation phase
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.960]   to distribution phase
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.560]   'cause a lot more decisions need to be made.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:45.680]   And usually that ends up being late 50s, early 60s.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.000]   Some people are super smart and able to manage it,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.520]   just depends on the situation.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.840]   - Okay, several questions about how to find advisors.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.160]   And you shared some tips,
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.200]   but one is what are the economics
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.440]   of financial or tax planners?
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.640]   It's hard to find a good fixed fee provider.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.480]   Is that because it's less remunerative to charge that way?
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.320]   - Well, so this all depends.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.400]   I mean, I would ask people,
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.800]   how much money do you think a financial planner
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.640]   should make per year, right?
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.680]   I mean, there's a lot of responsibility there.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.360]   And I know people who are cheap don't wanna pay anything,
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.080]   but you pay for what you get
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.900]   and you've gotta look for value.
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.800]   To me, first off,
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.640]   make sure that they truly do
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.960]   comprehensive financial planning.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.520]   That means the tax planning, the estate planning,
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.320]   and not doing the estate planning returns,
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.780]   but that they are estate planning documents,
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.440]   but that they'll work with your accountant
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.280]   and the estate planner
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.120]   to make sure everything's going together.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.280]   That's number one.
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.480]   And most of the people that,
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.560]   there are a lot of people charging flat AUM
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.960]   that are doing that,
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.560]   but there's all these organizations I gave you,
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.360]   most of them are now,
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.040]   NAPFA has a lot of AUM people,
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.280]   but the rest of them are flat fee
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:07.240]   or are small AUM fee with flat fee or their hourly fees.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.240]   - Okay, this is a good question.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.800]   What are the best ways to find a good tax planner
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.120]   if you don't have an accountant doing your taxes?
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.720]   And I would amplify that.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.480]   Even if you do have an accountant doing your taxes,
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.120]   he or she may not be doing forward-looking-
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.560]   - Yeah, accountants aren't the best
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.280]   at tax planning all the time.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.320]   A lot of them just like to do the returns.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.000]   And plus they don't know your big picture.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.920]   You know, the problem is tax planning
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.040]   can't be done in a void.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:36.240]   Tax planning really comes into play with income planning
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.840]   and with your investment planning.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.880]   So it all fits together.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.700]   And so what I would recommend for people
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.720]   who just want like a one-time thing,
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.680]   have a hourly financial planner,
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.480]   do a comprehensive financial plan.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.080]   You're gonna pay a couple thousand dollars for that,
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.760]   but it can be invaluable to make sure
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.680]   that you're doing everything right
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.120]   and that they're identifying,
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.240]   not just the tax planning for that year,
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.220]   but making certain that you're thinking out
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.140]   for the next five to 10 years.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:06.260]   Problem with accountants is they love to save you taxes today
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.260]   but they're not always thinking about the tax planning
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.620]   for the future too.
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:14.240]   So if you wanna continue to do it yourself along the way,
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.160]   that would be my suggestion for that.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.000]   - Okay, and then a couple of small board questions.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.360]   When you said forgetting to homestead,
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.920]   I was like, what does homestead mean?
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.560]   So this is the question, it's not from me,
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.880]   but someone else. - No, that's all right.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.020]   So, you know, every state's different,
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:32.720]   but homesteading means this is where I call home,
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.440]   this is my domicile, this is where I live.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:39.240]   And you can only have one homestead.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:42.660]   And so some states homestead provides no protection,
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:45.420]   but most states it provides some protection,
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:48.160]   and so it protects those assets against lawsuits.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.360]   So just Google in your state, should I homestead my home?
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.040]   Some states it doesn't make a difference, but most it does.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.520]   - Okay, last question, another kind of small board question
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.200]   related to one of the mistakes you mentioned.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.360]   You talked about that form 8606
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:05.000]   that goes with the non-deductible IRA contributions.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.400]   What is the preferred method to correct
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.760]   a missed or incorrect 8606?
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.940]   - The beautiful thing is you just have to file a new 8606
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.780]   with your next tax return.
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:19.180]   And then make sure for yourself in your own documents
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.500]   that you have everything to support
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.900]   what you put in that new 8606
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.580]   and keep it straight going forward.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.660]   - Okay, Carolyn, you are amazing.
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.260]   Thank you so much for being here to speak with us today.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.780]   Thank you. (audience applauding)
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:35.900]   - I hope I didn't scare the hell out of everybody,
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.460]   but I hope I scared you a little to make sure
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:40.680]   that when it's time to get help
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.900]   that you guys really do get help.
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:45.740]   (audio cuts out)
