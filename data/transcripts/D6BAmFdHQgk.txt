[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380]   (applause)
[00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.440]   So there's a good reason that our next speaker
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.480]   is one of the most sought-after speakers
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.340]   in the financial planning space.
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.320]   We have asked her to attend this conference
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.080]   a couple of years running, and she's had other engagements,
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.020]   and so we're so excited to have her here.
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.260]   She brings expertise to bear on several different areas,
[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.200]   which is one of the reasons why everyone wants her
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.960]   to come talk at their conferences.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.760]   So she's a medical doctor.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.700]   She understands health care matters.
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.400]   She's a financial planner.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.980]   That is her livelihood these days,
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.780]   and she's a certified financial planner.
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.040]   She's a human being who has worked with a lot
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.280]   of other human beings through her work,
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.860]   and so she brings a wonderful human quality
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.660]   to both the health care
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.060]   and the financial planning side of things.
[00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.660]   This is Carolyn McClanahan.
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.200]   We're so excited to have her here.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.560]   Please give me a round of applause in thanking her.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.960]   (applause)
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.580]   - Okay, am I on, am I on?
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.840]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.000]   I am actually so excited to be here.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.420]   So many people who have been mentors and idols to me,
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.040]   like such as Christine, Bill Bangen, I mean, are here,
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.920]   and so just so excited that I could also be here this year.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.680]   So when Christine asked, "What do you wanna talk about?"
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.580]   it took me no, I already knew what I wanted to talk about.
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.720]   When should you do it yourself
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.980]   or should quit doing it themselves?
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.680]   So a little bit of background.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.180]   Started out, I was a doctor.
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.520]   I practiced mainly emergency medicine.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.400]   My husband's an engineer, and we did our own investing.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.860]   I had a IRA when I was in residency,
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.460]   so started kind of early.
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.740]   He inherited some money in the mid '90s.
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.900]   We invested that money.
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.340]   We did quite well because we were so brilliant, right?
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.900]   We were lucky.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.340]   And towards the end of the '90s,
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.240]   and he had quit being an engineer,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.380]   and he didn't wanna go back.
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.320]   He wanted to be a photographer and a track coach.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.920]   So I married an engineer,
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.360]   but now he wanted to make no money, right?
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.760]   And I said, "Honey, I love you,
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.420]   "but I am not going to support you,
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.800]   "so we need to make sure this little bucket of money
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.560]   "that we've done well with is enough
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.760]   "for you to be able to quit."
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.040]   We knew it wasn't enough to retire,
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.400]   and we were only in our mid '30s,
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.040]   and I actually love medicine.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.880]   I still volunteer to this day.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.440]   I love patient care.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.780]   I do business of medicine.
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.880]   The culture of medicine is very challenging.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.020]   That is what I did not like.
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.020]   So I went back to school.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.740]   Well, no, we tried to find a financial planner,
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.480]   and they were sales schmucks.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.020]   They charged too much.
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.520]   They didn't really do -- This was back in 2000.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.480]   They called themselves financial advisors,
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.400]   but all that really meant was investments
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.320]   and not really financial planning.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.560]   And so they kept trying to, like,
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.100]   sell us products and stuff that we knew we didn't need
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.540]   'cause we were great do-it-yourselfers.
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.040]   So I decided to go back to school for fun,
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.200]   to learn about financial planning for me
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.400]   and for my husband, and I fell in love with it,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.840]   and I saw this huge need for people getting advice.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.040]   And at first, I was just going to take care of my ER buddies
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.940]   and my running buddies.
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.180]   I'm a runner.
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.560]   And then it just, like, I started a firm in 2004,
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.320]   and I was going to practice emergency medicine part-time,
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.160]   financial planning part-time,
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.120]   and then it just kind of exploded.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.460]   But plus, I found out I was the lowest-paid person
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.440]   in our practice, emergency medicine practice,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.600]   and I was the only woman.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.640]   And I'm like, "I am tired of this BS," so I left medicine.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.000]   And so I had my financial planning practice,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.280]   and all of a sudden, I had all these wonderful people
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.880]   from NAPFA and stuff that helped me get started
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.580]   and understand how to be a real financial planner.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.960]   And so all of a sudden, I started recognizing
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.080]   all these intersections of health and finance,
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.120]   like people don't know how to plan for chronic illness.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.220]   How do you help uninsurable clients get health insurance?
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.200]   This was back before the ACA.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.300]   So I started putting together all these fun talks.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.440]   Before you know it, I realize there is some stuff I know
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.160]   that could really help both professions.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.800]   So I'm really honored that I get to do this work.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.040]   I feel like it's my true calling.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.980]   And one of the things -- so my practice
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.880]   is fee-only fiduciary practice.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.480]   We don't try -- and I'm just telling you about my practice
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.160]   so you understand my mindset.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.480]   I hated AUM because it's like,
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.960]   "We are real financial planners.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.600]   Why are we charging people based on assets?"
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.660]   So I was one of the early pioneers
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.520]   of doing flat-feed planning, which I'm really excited
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.320]   because that is starting to blossom,
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.340]   and there are more flat-feed planners out there.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.840]   But, you know, I developed all this great clientele
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.040]   through the years, and we started recognizing --
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.880]   and we started getting a lot of do-it-yourselfers
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.540]   who realized that they needed help.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.280]   They'd become too complicated to do it themselves well,
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.280]   or they were getting into trouble.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.580]   And so I have lots of stories to tell you because,
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.280]   you know, doing it yourself is great.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.320]   I was a do-it-yourselfer.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.960]   And I want to go through how much should you do yourself,
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.100]   and then when should you get help,
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.260]   and then how and where to get help.
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.800]   So we are going to start with a quiz.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.740]   I'm going to have everybody raise their hand.
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.660]   These are -- you know, people think of financial planning
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.940]   as investments, and Bogleheads,
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.340]   you guys all love investment stuff,
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.300]   and I know you talk about tax, you talk about estate,
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.740]   but you're trying to do it all yourself.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.040]   I want to see how much you guys are really doing.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.780]   How many of you do all your cash flow in budgeting?
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.880]   That's the easy part, right?
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.060]   And you planned out your cash flows for the next
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.220]   however many years of your living in retirement.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.120]   Raise your hands if you've done that.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.120]   Good. How many of you do your own taxes?
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.940]   Ooh, how many of you do your own tax planning?
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.600]   Very different.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.200]   Wow. How many of you feel really good about your insurance
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   and your asset protection?
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.940]   Mm, less hands, but still enough.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.940]   How many of you have -- do not have an estate plan,
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.760]   or you've done your estate plan using Internet-based resources?
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.980]   How many of you have used an attorney --
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.220]   because people -- how many of you have used an attorney
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.160]   to do your estate plan?
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.560]   Okay. Some hands aren't missing,
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.020]   and it's probably the ones who are embarrassed
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.600]   to tell us they haven't done an estate plan.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.900]   Okay. And this one, I'm pretty sure I know the answer.
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.640]   How many of you do all your own investing?
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.980]   Okay. Okay. Now, let's start.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.280]   What I'm going to take you through is all the poops I see,
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.780]   right, of each of these sections.
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.340]   So, cash flow planning.
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.880]   Everybody should be able to do this, and thank goodness,
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.420]   financial literacy is improving, but not fast enough.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.360]   And so, what do I see people get in trouble with?
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.460]   They're not paying attention to their statements.
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.260]   Everything is Internet-based.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.060]   Now, all your statements are online.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.220]   So, how often do you really look at them?
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.700]   I see people with duplicate subscriptions
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.100]   or subscriptions they don't use, fraud that they haven't caught,
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.940]   that the banks haven't caught.
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.740]   So, it's really important to pay attention to your statements.
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.740]   The other thing is people don't ever download their statements.
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.460]   And if you get into an accident, or if you die, and your family has
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.380]   to pay the bills, and you don't have anybody else on the count,
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.420]   what happens to those accounts?
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.700]   They're frozen.
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.500]   And not only are they frozen, you're not going to be able
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.020]   to access them online, so your family's not going to know when
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.500]   and what bills need to be paid.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.980]   So, having too many accounts.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.580]   You know, you see this great yield at this account,
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.180]   this great yield at this account.
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.500]   Oh, this beautiful credit card.
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.380]   Before you know it, you have five, 10, 15 statements.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.140]   The estate planning attorneys will love you when you die,
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.060]   because now you've got to clean up all that mess
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.780]   if you have multiple accounts.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.380]   Poor social security claiming strategies.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.700]   People don't understand.
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.980]   It's not just about you.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.380]   It's you and your spouse.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.140]   And people don't think through good income planning
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.900]   so that they can delay social security
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.340]   to when it's most beneficial for them to take it.
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.260]   A lot of people say, "Government's going to run out of money."
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.980]   Government will not run out of money.
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.220]   It can't. It creates the money, right?
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.660]   We do have to have some tax issues around that.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.300]   But social security's not going to go away.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.100]   Too many people claim way too early, mostly out of fear,
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.660]   and they don't have anybody else to talk them out of it.
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.820]   And the big one is they don't notice they're slipping.
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.740]   So I had a 90-year-old client,
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.060]   and he was very good about paying his bills,
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.100]   and he got his credit card statement every month.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.980]   He looked at how much he would spend,
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.740]   and he would send the credit card people a check.
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.980]   This is -- he was getting paper statements.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:43.020]   And somewhere along the line, he had started automatic bill pay.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.540]   So he was paying this credit card every month by a check.
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.700]   They were also deducting stuff automatically.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.500]   And before you know it -- and the son finally caught it.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.900]   He had a $2,000 credit card balance of money he could spend.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.780]   And it's like, "Okay, this guy could die any day.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.980]   It's hard to get money out of the credit card."
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.660]   So they had a big family outing at Maggiano's
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.380]   when all the grandkids and kids came down,
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.180]   and they spent the entire $2,000.
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.260]   But the son looked at -- kept up with him going forward
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.460]   because we didn't -- the slip was a gradual decline.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.980]   Tax plan -- a PREP.
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.060]   And tax planning software makes it easy,
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.980]   but when do people get in trouble?
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.100]   When they have self-employment income or business income,
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.620]   a lot of people miss deductions.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.220]   A big one I see is the health insurance deduction.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.300]   You know, if you're self-employed and on Medicare,
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.340]   you can deduct Medicare premiums
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.020]   from your self-employment income.
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.580]   So, you know, there are a lot of little tax things
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.660]   that people don't understand that they deduct,
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.980]   so they miss a lot of things.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.940]   Alternative investments, to me, just create a mess with --
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.500]   and I'm speaking to the choir here, though --
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.180]   mess with your taxes, because now you've got to wait
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.500]   on your K-1s.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.860]   You've got to make sure your K-1s are appropriately put in.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.160]   Too much trading.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.660]   Had to do-it-yourselfer who came to me.
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.740]   His Schedule D was 10 pages long.
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.580]   You got -- the people who do taxes are --
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.100]   you guys understand what happened there?
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.940]   He was trading, trading, trading, wash sales,
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.740]   crazy stuff going on.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.100]   So, thank goodness he didn't -- he did it himself quite well,
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.940]   but he was in a lucky moment.
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.060]   But his taxes were a mess.
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.340]   Multiple income streams.
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.220]   A lot of times people are -- you know, that have two jobs
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.300]   or two spouses have jobs.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.620]   They're not withholding the amount,
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.900]   especially if you have great investments
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.400]   and that are kicking off income
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.940]   because you're not tax-efficient with your investments,
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.580]   then you don't do enough withholding.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.780]   Now, how many of you here know what a 8606 is?
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.080]   Part of you.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.380]   Okay, great.
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.680]   So, when you do IRA contributions,
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.500]   non-deductible IRA contributions or any contributions,
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.660]   Roth conversions, it gets recorded on Form 8606.
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.380]   How many of you have had more
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.260]   than one accountant in your lifetime?
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.420]   For those who don't do their taxes, some say, "Well,
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.420]   I'm my own accountant, so I don't mess up."
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.100]   Well, what happens is, if you change accountants,
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.140]   oftentimes if you were doing non-deductible IRA
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:14.180]   contributions, 8606 tracks your basis in your IRA.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.820]   So, when you do that Roth conversion, you don't have to --
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.740]   or you pull money out of your IRA, you don't have to pay taxes
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.420]   on that post-tax money.
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.620]   Well, if you don't keep up with 8606s, that gets lost.
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.100]   And so, I've had clients that have had, you know, 40, 50,
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.820]   $60,000 in IRA contributions they made in the past
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.380]   or a post-tax that got lost because they changed accountants
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.860]   and it wasn't in the old accounting software.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.700]   We've even had clients who kept the same accountants
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.500]   and the accountants got new accounting software
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.220]   and the new accounting software didn't carry
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.380]   over the old 8606s.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.460]   So, it can be a mess.
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.460]   And then finally, again, I'm going to say this over and over
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.780]   and I'm going to get deeper into this,
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.700]   cognitive decline is an issue.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.140]   Now, tax planning, biggest mistakes I see.
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.420]   Not utilizing lower tax brackets for income and capital gains.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.380]   How many of you are really good at this?
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.620]   Oh, not many hands.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.980]   OK. Nothing breaks my heart more than to see a tax return
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.340]   with negative income.
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.780]   You know, like you've had so many deductions that you go,
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.140]   "Oh, my tax is zero.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.060]   I'm so excited.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.100]   My negative income is 20,000."
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.420]   What have you done there?
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.500]   You missed out on tax-free Roth conversions
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.540]   or IRA distributions if you need the money, whatever.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:37.380]   And so, it's important to call the age 60 to 70 the golden age
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.020]   of tax planning for retirement because that's
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.580]   when you're not taking Social Security yet.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.140]   You don't have required distributions yet.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.060]   You might not-- If you're early retiree,
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.940]   you might not have a lot of income.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.780]   You might be in the 10% tax bracket.
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:56.220]   You can take capital gains, 0% capital gains tax rate
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.060]   up to when you're through the 12% bracket.
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.900]   And so, I see so many people missing
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.540]   out on these tax planning opportunities
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.620]   in those early years of retirement.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.100]   Also, for people who need health insurance, ACA tax credits.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.140]   If you do great income planning, you can get health insurance
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:18.060]   from age 60 to 65 for nothing.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.940]   Great health insurance, tax credits worth $20,000
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.420]   if you do good income planning.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.060]   A lot of people don't know this.
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.300]   So, miscalculating retirement plan distributions.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.860]   People have multiple jobs now.
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.060]   So, they'll retire with 403(b), another 401(k).
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.740]   They have three IRAs.
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.980]   Well, some-- Everybody knows that you can take--
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.420]   you can lump all your IRA distributions for your RMDs
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.060]   and take them from one IRA, but you can't do
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.780]   that for 403(b)s and 401(k)s.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.660]   So, making mistakes on that, and that creates a nightmare.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.340]   Making inappropriate contributions.
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.100]   Just had a new client come to us recently.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.500]   Been making Roth contributions for a few years now,
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.140]   and his income is $400,000 a year.
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.660]   Yep. Got to do some unwinding there.
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.260]   I'm like, "Oh, I hate to tell you this."
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.660]   I love when I can tell people good news.
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.540]   I hate the bad news, but he won't do it going forward.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.100]   Not keeping up with basis.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.220]   How many of you have stocks or mutual funds
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.180]   where you don't know the basis?
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.460]   Not many, but the good news is the rules changed recently.
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.900]   So, all the reporting, all the mutual funds,
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.820]   and the custodians have to help you keep up with basis.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.260]   That wasn't so, but a lot of people will have old stocks
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.340]   where they don't know basis, and so,
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.100]   especially we have one client who had this stock.
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.300]   We kept bugging him to get basis for us.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.540]   Well, the company was bought out and sold,
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:48.260]   and his shares were forced sale, basically.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.340]   And now, we have this $64,000 capital gain
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.380]   that he didn't know basis.
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.740]   Painful, painful, painful.
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.540]   You see this a lot with employee stock
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.100]   because they didn't do a good job keeping up
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.180]   with basis during employee stock.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.140]   Poor charitable planning breaks my heart
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.980]   when I see people they're giving away
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.860]   like $10,000 a year using cash.
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.780]   You know, maybe they get $10,000 property tax deduction,
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.820]   income tax deduction because of the SALT caps.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.140]   So, they have $20,000 of deduction a year,
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.420]   and then they end up having to take the standard deduction
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.380]   because it's under a standard deduction.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.220]   Well, let's say you're age 60,
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.060]   and you give $10,000 a year away,
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.940]   and you have some appreciated stock.
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.460]   Well, you could take $100,000 of appreciated stock.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.340]   You don't have to pay the capital gains taxes.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.980]   You can put it in donor-advised fund.
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.980]   You get a big write-off that year.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.420]   You can either do Roth conversions,
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.620]   take capital gains, you name it.
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.180]   You can use that, and then you get
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.900]   the standard deduction the rest of the time.
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.060]   You saved a load in taxes.
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.580]   So, these are the things do-it-yourselfers
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:53.640]   don't think about.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.420]   Gifting inappropriately.
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.060]   People have, and I've already heard it.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.340]   I love this audience.
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.220]   You know, I was on the panel this morning.
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.660]   A lot of you guys have already told me
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.040]   some great stories throughout the day,
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.220]   and I hear a lot about like gift,
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.120]   you know, I have all this appreciated stock.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.300]   What do I do with it?
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.780]   Give it to your children who are in low tax brackets.
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.820]   Let them sell it.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.620]   Sometimes they can sell at 0% capital gains rate.
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.420]   Great way to gift.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.100]   Also, you can, the other gifting mistake I see,
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.100]   oh, I have a lot of money.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.460]   I want to help my children buy a house.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.800]   So, you just give them $200,000.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.580]   Well, most likely because the IRS is so busy
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.780]   that they're not gonna get in trouble with that,
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.420]   but let's say they change the estate tax laws,
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.080]   and now our estate tax exemption is lower.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.180]   If you didn't document that correctly,
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.220]   that could cause problems down the line.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.580]   So, have I hit any buttons yet?
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.920]   We'll wait till we get to the investments.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.020]   Insurance, you know, people who are do-it-yourselfers,
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.940]   two reason people do it themselves.
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:00.800]   They don't trust people, or they're cheap, right?
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.600]   And the problem with when you're cheap,
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.780]   you also tend to be cheap across the board
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.680]   so you don't buy enough insurance.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.340]   Nothing breaks my heart than seeing people
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:15.020]   who have a few million dollars in unprotected assets,
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.860]   and they have the minimum underlying coverage
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.140]   on their auto liability.
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.340]   I mean, in Florida, that's a nightmare,
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.300]   and man, you could get sued in a heartbeat.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.980]   There's a reason O.J. Simpson,
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.300]   well, there's a lot of old people in here.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.180]   I'm old, so I can say that.
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.620]   You guys remember O.J. Simpson and all that.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.980]   So, what's the first thing he did when he got in trouble?
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.220]   What did he go do?
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.980]   He bought a big, huge mansion in Florida.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.620]   I'm from Florida.
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.020]   And the reason he did that is that home
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.140]   is 100% protected from creditors.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.180]   Every state's different.
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.140]   Florida's just very good about creditor protection,
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.160]   but some people forget to homestead,
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.140]   so you lose that creditor protection,
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.340]   so you gotta make sure your home is protected
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.800]   by homesteading it.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.880]   Inappropriate titling of assets.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.620]   People will buy a car.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.780]   If you buy a car, the primary driver of the car
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.300]   should be the only owner of the car.
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.220]   Don't put it jointly, 'cause it's gonna be easier later,
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.860]   'cause that just opens up everybody to being sued
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.260]   if that car's in a wreck.
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.300]   Or having things joint tenants by entirety
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.480]   makes it less likely that those assets
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.100]   will be taken by creditors.
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.360]   Estate planning.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.620]   So many people raise their hand
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.300]   that they did their estate plans, which excites me.
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.700]   If you look at the data,
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.700]   there's all these different studies,
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.740]   but anywhere from 50 to 67% of people
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.580]   don't have estate plans.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.060]   So you guys are doing better than average,
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.720]   which is what I'd expect.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.080]   Now, I do not like using internet-based documents,
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.160]   and why is that?
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.940]   You guys, I have talked so much today.
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.420]   It's been so fun and exciting.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.340]   I'm losing my voice, so I apologize.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.140]   I'm just gonna hold on to this.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.120]   If I've had this happen two times now,
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.120]   how many of you have ever had a power of attorney document
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.320]   turned down by a financial institution?
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.860]   Right, and so the problem, they're very persnickety,
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.500]   and if you have done your power of attorney document
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.180]   through internet-based service,
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.200]   or through some legal Zoom sort of thing or whatever,
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.400]   how, who do you have to stand up for you?
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.700]   Is it Mr. Google?
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.220]   No, nobody.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.920]   And that's why, to me, it's really important
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.860]   for you guys to use real people
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.060]   to do your estate planning documents
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.540]   and your power of attorney documents,
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.440]   because if you get in trouble, and I've had this happen,
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.020]   I call up Mr. Attorney, and I say,
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.860]   Mr. Attorney, bank is turning down
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.060]   this perfectly legal, valid power of attorney that you did,
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.380]   and he writes nasty gram to the bank.
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.540]   We will sue your butt off if you do not accept this.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.860]   And what does the bank do?
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.300]   They accept it.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.660]   So pay the couple hundred bucks
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.520]   to get a real power of attorney done,
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.520]   or the 1,500 if your situation's simple,
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.440]   it's more complicated, you're gonna pay more,
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.860]   pay the money to get good estate planning documents done.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.740]   Now here's the other big mistake.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.000]   I think everybody says, oh, I left all this money
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.420]   to my children through my will.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.180]   Well, how do assets pass?
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.980]   They pass three ways.
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.020]   First is titling.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.140]   If you own something jointly with rights of survivorship,
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.700]   it goes to the survivor, right?
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.820]   It doesn't go through your will.
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.380]   For your IRAs, life insurance, annuities,
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.420]   ideally you have beneficiaries listed.
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.720]   If not, they'll go through your will,
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.580]   but now you have probate issues.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.660]   So ideally you should have beneficiaries
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.780]   to all these things.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.060]   You should have all your copies
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.020]   of your beneficiaries on file,
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.140]   and you should understand how much everybody's gonna get.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.760]   Sometimes people have different beneficiaries
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.900]   on the documents than the way they're passing things
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.980]   through will, and they don't understand
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.300]   that people are gonna get different amounts of money.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.620]   So make sure you understand exactly
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.500]   how everything is going to pass,
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.420]   and that everything is titled correctly.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.300]   One other titling mistake I see.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.180]   People go to their estate planning attorney,
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.620]   and they create these beautiful trusts,
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.620]   and then they don't do anything with them.
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.420]   They forget to title the assets to the trust,
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.380]   and it doesn't, you don't have a trust.
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.860]   A trust doesn't work if you don't title the assets.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.580]   So this is one big story.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.220]   Client of mine was gonna be the executor
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:33.220]   for his dad's estate, and his dad was 94.
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.140]   Dad, we knew, had a lot of money.
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.220]   We just didn't know how much,
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.500]   'cause dad was very secretive, and he had done well,
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.500]   and he did not like financial advisors,
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.040]   because they were all schmucks,
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.780]   but son had no clue what his dad had.
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.300]   I said, "You're gonna have a hot mess on your hands,
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.600]   "I promise you."
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.020]   So he told dad, "My financial advisor happens
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.620]   "to help make sure old people stay out of trouble.
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.300]   "She's not gonna charge you a thing.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.240]   "She's just gonna do it as a learning thing for me,
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.200]   "'cause I need to understand what you have,
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.940]   "'cause I don't know what you have."
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.900]   He said, "Okay, bring her on," the 94-year-old did.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.940]   So I meet with him.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.580]   He's very proud of how well he did.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.460]   Six million dollars, that was his estate.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.600]   Four million in taxable accounts,
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.020]   two million in retirement plans.
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.380]   He says, "I have done my trust."
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.180]   I'm like, "Oh, great, show me your trust."
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.060]   His trust, all his beneficiaries were his sons.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.220]   He left tiny amounts to his grandkids,
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.260]   and he left about, it was gonna end up
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.340]   being about two million bucks,
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.580]   half of the taxable estate to charity.
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.140]   Very charitable.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.740]   And so I said, "Show me your assets."
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:39.580]   And guess what?
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.860]   He had 40 different stocks in street name.
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.300]   Do you guys know what that means?
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.380]   At the actual holding companies.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.740]   He owned them all individually.
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.300]   He still had some old stock certificates.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.480]   That is an estate planning nightmare.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.100]   Do I have an estate planning attorney in here?
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.300]   Is there, are there any?
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.380]   None, I'm sad.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.700]   They will stand up and say, "That's a nightmare.
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.700]   "That's gonna be expensive probate,
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.460]   "hours and hours of work."
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.620]   And so it was not titled to his trust,
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.840]   so he'd have to go to probate to go to his trust.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.340]   So what are the mistakes there?
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.100]   Anybody shout out one big mistake you hear?
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.180]   Charities listed in trust?
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.560]   Oh, the IRA beneficiaries were his sons.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:28.500]   So if the way he left it is the charity
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.780]   would get assets in the trust.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.140]   Sons would get IRAs that have to pay taxes on them.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.500]   And so happened his retirement plans for $2 million.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.780]   So what we ended up doing is we amended his trust
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.980]   to get, and it's all his grandkids were gonna get
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.620]   like 10,000 and we mine it in small amounts.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.660]   And it's like, why are they even listed in the documents?
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.140]   And so what we ended up doing is had his trust redone,
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:57.420]   named his sons, the beneficiaries of the trust
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.180]   and made sure, and then we moved all those assets
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.180]   into a brokerage, all those stocks or industry name
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:06.160]   into a brokerage account titled to his trust.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.380]   And then we made the IRAs the beneficiary,
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.380]   the beneficiaries were the charities
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.840]   because the charities don't have to pay tax on the IRAs.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.620]   So that saved that family about $600,000 in income tax.
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.660]   And oh, and by the way, the guys told me,
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.180]   we've got plenty of time to deal with this.
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.340]   I'm gonna live till I'm 105.
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:31.460]   He died the year after we cleaned everything up.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.540]   Family loved me.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.640]   Now, so these are the things people don't know
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.760]   when you're a do-it-yourselfer and especially
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.220]   when you start getting too complicated.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.980]   Investments, I've heard this in this room.
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.740]   So many questions are just like,
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.300]   you guys are doing a great job managing your investments,
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.540]   but too many people don't understand
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.260]   the goals for their money.
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.140]   It's like, how much do you really need?
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.180]   Are you taking the appropriate amount of risk?
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.140]   It killed me in 2008, the number of people
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.900]   once 2009 hit that were aggressively invested
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.020]   because the stock market was doing so great
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.180]   and they had to un-retire.
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.460]   Those weren't my clients, by the way.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.780]   They became my clients after 2009, right?
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.180]   And so not understanding how much risk
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.140]   you can take in your portfolio
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.020]   that's going to keep you financially secure
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.480]   so you don't run out of money.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.660]   Poor tax management, we already talked about.
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.860]   You know, people owning bonds in the Roths.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.440]   I know you guys don't do stuff like that.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.400]   Please tell me no.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.000]   And owning like REITs and taxable accounts.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.860]   So we see a lot of unnecessary tax things in portfolios.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.540]   Too many accounts, not simplifying.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.420]   We already talked about the titling,
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.060]   not keeping up with basis.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.580]   And again, not addressing cognitive decline.
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.580]   So I know none of you are going to confess
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.900]   if you do any of this, but if you do,
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.500]   you need to get help.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.580]   So when should you get help?
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.580]   Three situations.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.160]   I call these the poop piles.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.640]   I'm a doctor.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.420]   I do talk a lot about inappropriate things.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.500]   So Christine knows that.
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.780]   She's heard me talk quite a few times.
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.420]   Three poop piles are
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.440]   if you have a complicated financial situation,
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.220]   if someone is counting on you
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.460]   and you're the only one who knows everything going on,
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.800]   and if you're starting to slip.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.620]   And the problem is people who are starting to slip
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.040]   know they're starting to slip,
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.480]   but they think they're doing better
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.160]   than they're really doing.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.700]   This is just a fact.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.500]   So are you complicated?
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.800]   First off, what are your skillsets?
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.180]   You may be very good at investing,
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.180]   but maybe it's really hard to know everything.
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.320]   Once you start getting a million dollars,
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.540]   two million dollars, which is what you need
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.180]   for a successful retirement for most people,
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.000]   I mean, as far as if you want to
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.900]   not have to just rely on social security,
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.580]   you can maybe manage those assets,
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.100]   but do you know how to withdraw them tax efficiently?
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.660]   Do you have everything titled correctly?
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.740]   It's good to have somebody look from the outside,
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.460]   just make sure that you have all your ducks in a row,
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.820]   that all the puzzle pieces fit together,
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.400]   'cause you don't know what you don't know.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.380]   You know, like my client didn't know
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.140]   he made too much money to contribute to a Roth.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.740]   He had a lot of money too, so it was amazing.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.580]   I'm like, whew.
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.700]   So consider getting an hourly planner
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.020]   just to look at your big picture.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.740]   And I would caution you, I mean,
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.860]   the distribution, accumulation is easy.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:17.860]   You guys know that.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.620]   It's the distribution phase
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.300]   that can get a little challenging.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.020]   And so, yeah, you can learn it all.
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.300]   And I have clients,
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.500]   they could seriously be financial planners.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.780]   They're so good, but it's really important to be smart
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.060]   and have somebody else looking behind you
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.660]   to make sure you know what you don't,
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.980]   that they can help you identify what you don't know
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.700]   during that distribution phase.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.680]   Now, if someone else is counting on you,
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.480]   I break this into two buckets.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.180]   The spouse that have the skills.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.860]   So, like in my family,
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.080]   who takes care of the finances in my family?
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.660]   My husband, 'cause I'm too busy, he deals with it.
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.340]   But I know everything going on.
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.300]   I know how to get in the accounts.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.380]   I do, I can look at our cash flow and stuff
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.420]   'cause we use a portal.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.540]   I can look at anything, anytime.
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.260]   And we check in to make sure
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.240]   I know how to log into everything.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.200]   Especially with two-factor authentication in the phone,
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.940]   you guys need to know how to log into each other's phones.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.500]   I had one client that I went to their house,
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.180]   their caretaker that was paying all the bills,
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.460]   it was his sister, they were very close,
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.300]   and lo and behold, his phone,
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.100]   the only way you could get into it,
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.620]   and he had everything in two-factor authentication,
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.540]   was a thumbprint.
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.020]   I'm like, okay, you're on, and he was on his deathbed.
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.740]   I was going, I mean, going to make sure
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:42.260]   we had everything titled up, I mean, tidied up.
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.560]   And I'm like, oh my God, we can't,
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.240]   we don't have your thumb when you're dead.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.200]   So we were at last minute trying to,
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.680]   we had to get his phone
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.680]   to where his sister could get into it.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:56.040]   So it's those things you gotta make sure that every,
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.340]   there's somebody that knows how to get to your stuff.
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.760]   Now, if your spouse or the people looking after you
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.400]   does not have, don't have the skills,
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.080]   you gotta have still, you know,
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.000]   I call them yearly audits, at least once a year,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.460]   check in and make sure they know
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.580]   how to at least get into everything,
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.780]   but have a good backup plan
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.500]   to also know how to take care of everything.
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.220]   And I always make our spouses learn
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.920]   how to at least know what bills need to be paid,
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.140]   how to pay the bills, log into the accounts,
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.700]   and that they understand the very big picture
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.260]   of their investments and finances.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:35.980]   You guys, I'm gonna be really cooked by tomorrow morning
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:37.420]   how much I've been talking to you.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.120]   So I might have to have Grand Marnier tonight
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.320]   to keep my throat going.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.480]   So I, and I'm gonna, a quick story on this one.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.360]   I had a client, and this is actually what sent me
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.440]   on this journey of having people plan
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.320]   for aging and serious health events.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.000]   I had a client who had lung cancer,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.760]   diagnosed in his early 50s, had a wife.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.000]   Wife was oblivious to anything,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.840]   and he had a very complicated situation.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.220]   And when he was diagnosed, he says,
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.320]   "Carolyn, I'm gonna beat it.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.000]   "Doctor me knows the prognosis."
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.900]   You know, so I'm, say, helping him plan
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.500]   and not taking his hope away.
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.700]   I said, "You gotta teach your wife
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.380]   "how to like at least pay the bills."
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.220]   So he says, "I'm gonna do that.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.820]   "I'll make sure she knows how to pay the bills."
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.080]   I said, "Because at least when you're going
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.300]   "through treatment, she can lift some of the load."
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.740]   And she promised me that she would learn how to pay bills,
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.780]   'cause I always talk to both clients.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.280]   And so every month or two, I'd ask,
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.780]   "How's the bill pay come along?"
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.380]   And she would say to me,
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.220]   "He's getting really frustrated with me."
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.540]   I get a call from her saying,
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.760]   "Joe is in the driveway having a seizure,
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.920]   "and he won't go to the hospital."
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.640]   You know, 'cause he'd come out of the seizure.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.560]   And so I actually drive over there,
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.560]   and I know, because I'm a doctor,
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.840]   that his lung cancer's probably gone to his brain,
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.800]   'cause that's why he's having the seizure.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.500]   And I get over there, and he's in his office
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.440]   on his daybed, and he's rocking,
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.320]   'cause he has a big headache.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.800]   And I'm saying, "You really gotta go to the hospital.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.000]   "We gotta get you there."
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.280]   And I happen to see this pile of unopened mail on his desk.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.980]   What was it?
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.500]   The bills.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.700]   I said, "What are those bills?"
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.020]   I hadn't had a chance to get to them.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.420]   They had not been paid in a couple of months.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.620]   I mean, this was a guy who was so on it.
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.220]   And so I'm like, "Whew."
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.380]   And so I said, "We're going to the hospital."
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.420]   Scooped up, got the wife, scooped up the bills.
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.620]   I said, "Get the checkbook."
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.300]   At least I knew she was on the checkbook.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.460]   And so while we're in the emergency room,
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.180]   I am having her write out the bills
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.980]   while we're trying to get him settled.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.140]   And that shouldn't happen.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.360]   And that's what put me on this mission.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.240]   So last one, are you slipping?
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.360]   So with aging, we do face,
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.720]   our brain slows down a little bit.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.680]   We can't make decisions as fast as we used to.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.920]   But thank goodness, with aging comes wisdom.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.440]   So most people are able to at least slow down,
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.920]   think through things, know what's not right.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.000]   But this is how fraudsters get to you.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.600]   They prey on by pressuring you,
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.920]   trying to get you to make quick decisions,
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.640]   and operating on fear, which as you get older,
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.360]   you become more concrete in your thinking.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.920]   It's easier to prey on your fear.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.060]   So that's normal aging.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:13.080]   About 12 to 18% of people over 60
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.440]   develop what's called mild cognitive impairment.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.640]   That means you can function day-to-day,
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.480]   but you may need some assistive devices
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.560]   in keeping you from forgetting things
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.080]   like making lists or, you know, having reminders.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.440]   So, and most people with mild cognitive impairment
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.680]   stay stable and do fine until they die,
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.200]   but 10 to 20% go on to develop dementia.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.240]   Now dementia, the risk of that doubles
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.680]   every five years over age 60.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.960]   So people age 65 to 69, 3% have dementia.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.920]   By the time you're over 90, 35% have dementia.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.120]   Problem is, and I have dealt with this over and over,
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.200]   when you're in the throes
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.180]   of having mild cognitive impairment or dementia,
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.520]   you think you're better than you are.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.240]   And you may know you have dementia,
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.680]   and you do when you're officially diagnosed,
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.000]   it's devastating, but you think you're functioning,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.680]   and you're not as well as you should be.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.520]   And so it's really important to plan well in advance
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.820]   before the event happens.
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.840]   So what we actually do with clients
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.240]   when they're in their late 50s, early 60s,
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.320]   we have what we call an aging plan.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.320]   And it's where we go through
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.600]   what I call the four big things of aging.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.480]   When, where are you gonna age?
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.280]   And when are you gonna move to where
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.480]   if it's no longer safe to age in place where you are?
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.420]   When are you gonna turn over financial decision-making?
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.840]   When are you gonna get help with healthcare decision-making?
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.240]   And when are you gonna quit driving?
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.740]   Driving's a big one, isn't it?
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:42.180]   Now, when you do that when somebody's well,
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.580]   it takes the fear factor out,
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.080]   and 'cause nobody, they're not defensive,
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:47.920]   they're not worried,
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.520]   oh, they think there's a problem with me.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.520]   When you make that standard process,
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.880]   it creates muscle memory for, oh, we talked about this.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.120]   And if you talk about it every few years,
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.300]   it makes it where people are more comfortable
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.460]   when the poop actually hits the fan,
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.920]   sticking with the plan of what you agreed on
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.360]   when you're in your late 50s, early 60s.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.800]   And now that I've been doing this,
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.080]   I started that aging planning in 2009
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.320]   after I had a big client event that it's like,
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.560]   well, we gotta do better planning for dementia.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.800]   And now I actually have had clients
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.840]   who've gone through the aging plan
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.480]   and now they have cognitive impairment or dementia.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.540]   It has worked wonderfully.
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.240]   Now, it's still agonizing
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.880]   when you're diagnosed with dementia,
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.480]   and it's still painful, but everybody follows the plan.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.780]   'Cause part of that process is we also start
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.560]   involving the healthcare surrogates
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.000]   and the financial surrogates
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.360]   long before a need ever arises.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.160]   So what we do is if you are slipping,
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.720]   you always have a backup,
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.160]   you do yearly audits with your backup,
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.720]   and at some point you allow them
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.600]   to observe what you're doing,
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.040]   and you may wanna involve a planner.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.220]   Now, when do you get help?
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.320]   Where do you get help?
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:01.020]   So if you have financially adept children,
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:03.660]   and I met a couple, a mother and son here earlier
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.620]   just delighted my heart that he's actually getting,
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.260]   she actually made him come here, I think.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:14.260]   But for families to start that financial education early
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.940]   and to start help getting the kids involved
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.060]   so they understand what they're gonna be taking over.
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.520]   But, and then the other option is you have outside parties.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.160]   I think of a financial planner as a quarterback
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.520]   to help with all the situations,
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.480]   and you wanna make sure that you have an accountant
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.040]   and attorney that understands your situation.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.120]   The more people you have involved,
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.320]   the less chance something nefarious will occur
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.720]   because people have to stay on their P's and Q's
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.680]   when everybody knows what's going on.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.720]   So if you're using family members or friends,
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.520]   create transparency with everybody.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.540]   So it may be one child in charge,
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.840]   but you wanna make sure that they're reporting
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.500]   to the other kids and the other kids know all the finances
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.980]   and they know the plan.
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.620]   Again, it reduced the chances of nefarious things,
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:05.020]   and it lets the other kids know that,
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.980]   hey, brother has it and he's doing okay
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.940]   'cause we can see everything all along the way.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.820]   Make sure everybody's on the same page.
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.540]   So perfect example I had, I have one client,
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.640]   Boglehead, and he loves our passive investing style.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.560]   His son-in-law, who's an amazing young man,
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.860]   still thinks he can beat the market.
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:28.460]   You know how you are when you're young.
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:33.460]   And I said to the father-in-law, my client,
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.460]   I'm a little worried that he might try to change
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.140]   what we're doing if something happens to you
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.140]   'cause his client's getting really on up there.
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.060]   And he says, "We're gonna have a conversation."
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.080]   So the three of us had a meeting,
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.220]   and my client basically said to his son-in-law,
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.860]   who's gonna be his financial surrogate,
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.980]   "Don't change anything I'm doing."
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.900]   And then the rest of the family knows that same thing.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.860]   So we made sure everybody's on the same page,
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.240]   and the son-in-law said,
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.900]   "I promise I will never do that."
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.820]   And so consider also involving an outside party,
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.220]   like a financial planner, the accountant or attorney,
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.300]   to keep the peace.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.620]   Advisors, thank goodness things have changed so much
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.920]   from when I started.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:13.500]   Make sure that you use a fee-only fiduciary.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.820]   And for most bogey heads, you're gonna do best
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.980]   with somebody who's hourly or flat fee.
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.260]   Not a fan of AUM, of course,
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.780]   'cause I don't think it's fair
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.220]   for people to have a lot of money.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.900]   And I don't think financial planning
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.700]   should be paid for based on assets.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.500]   But more and more advisors are moving towards
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.540]   having financial planning fees
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.780]   with tiny asset management fees.
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:35.860]   Those may be okay.
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.320]   But for people who are just charging
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.500]   one, one and a half percent AUM,
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.660]   and they're doing financial planning under it,
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.620]   most of 'em are not focusing on the financial planning.
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.020]   Where do you find 'em?
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.860]   These are all organizations
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.820]   that only accept fee-only fiduciaries.
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:56.860]   Make sure that your accountant and attorney
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.320]   will work with your financial planner.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.980]   And the reason why is if they're not working as a team,
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:06.580]   then there may be holes that you can't identify.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.060]   So if I have an accountant, I mean a client
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:10.860]   whose accountant or attorney won't work with me,
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:14.400]   I say, I don't really like your accountant or attorney,
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.020]   the fact that they won't work with me,
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.620]   so you either need to talk with them or we need to change.
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.380]   And most often, they change.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:24.260]   So that's a professional fiduciary.
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.980]   Some states have those available, like California.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.660]   So if you don't have anybody else to help you,
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.580]   that's how you might wanna do it.
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:33.860]   And then finally, turning over duties.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.460]   Especially do-it-yourselfers,
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.540]   it's such a sense of purpose and accomplishment
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:40.020]   when you're doing it yourself.
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.180]   It can be devastating to all of a sudden just say,
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.340]   I gotta give this up.
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.180]   So you make it a transition.
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:46.880]   And I've already talked about that,
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.060]   but make sure, talk about it early
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:53.640]   and make that transition last as long as possible.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.980]   So in summary, and I think we have five minutes
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.380]   for questions, biggest danger to financial well-being
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.100]   is not fraud or abuse.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.100]   Just a reminder though, 90% of financial fraud
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.420]   is done by friends and family.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:10.340]   So that's why you need to have multiple people involved,
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.860]   but the bigger dollars are stolen by the other 10%,
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:14.980]   just so you know.
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:18.000]   But the biggest danger to your financial well-being
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.780]   is the person who fails to recognize
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.860]   that they have limitations and they refuse to get help.
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.340]   Being a do-it-yourselfer is great
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.740]   as long as you plan for the day
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.760]   you can no longer do it yourself.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.180]   And now we'll do some questions.
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:31.380]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.220]   I'm gonna stand over here
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.500]   'cause I know you're gonna use that microphone.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.620]   - Thank you, Carolyn, that was great.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:37.460]   One sec.
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.540]   Okay, now.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.820]   So let's do this lightning round style
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.540]   'cause we have to get through a lot.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.700]   So first question, how do you recommend
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.700]   handling a parent who is slipping cognitively
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.500]   who does not recognize that they are having the decline?
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.380]   - Well, again, the first thing is
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:53.660]   you should have those conversations
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.580]   long before they're ever slipping.
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.740]   But once they are slipping,
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.880]   you have to remember there comes a point
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.940]   where the child has to be the parent.
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.700]   And you just have to say, I'm really worried about you.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.440]   And I think that you may be having challenges
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.820]   and say, would you mind undergoing testing
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:12.700]   just to make sure there's nothing going on
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.060]   that we don't know about?
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.460]   If you have objective testing saying you're fine,
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.700]   we're gonna feel good.
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.460]   If you're not fine, then we know
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.940]   we need to start putting in protections to help you.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.100]   - Okay, great.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.360]   Is there a particular age or life stage
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.900]   when DIY investors tend to make mistakes?
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.660]   I think I heard you say that we,
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.860]   the incidence tends to pick up as we age.
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.460]   - Well, it starts to pick up more
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.780]   when you're moving from accumulation phase
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.940]   to distribution phase
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:41.540]   'cause a lot more decisions need to be made.
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:45.660]   And usually that ends up being late 50s, early 60s.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.980]   Some people are super smart and able to manage it.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.500]   It just depends on the situation.
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.840]   - Okay, several questions about how to find advisors.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.180]   And you shared some tips,
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.220]   but one is what are the economics
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:00.460]   of financial or tax planners?
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.660]   It's hard to find a good fixed fee provider.
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:07.500]   Is that because it's less remunerative to charge that way?
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.340]   - Well, so this all depends.
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.460]   I mean, I would ask people,
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.860]   how much money do you think a financial planner
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.700]   should make per year, right?
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.780]   I mean, there's a lot of responsibility there.
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.400]   And I know people who are cheap don't wanna pay anything,
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.140]   but you pay for what you get
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:25.960]   and you've gotta look for value.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.340]   To me, first off, make sure that they truly
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.980]   do comprehensive financial planning.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:35.540]   That means the tax planning, the estate planning,
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.340]   and not doing the estate planning returns,
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.820]   but that they are estate planning documents,
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.460]   but that they'll work with your accountant
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.180]   and estate planner to make sure everything's going together.
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.340]   That's number one.
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.500]   And most of the people that,
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.580]   there are a lot of people charging flat AUM
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.980]   that are doing that,
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:56.620]   but there's all these organizations I gave you,
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.380]   most of them are now,
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.080]   NAPFA has a lot of AUM people,
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.300]   but the rest of them are flat fee
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:07.300]   or are small AUM fee with flat fee or their hourly fees.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.300]   - Okay, this is a good question.
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.860]   What are the best ways to find a good tax planner
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.140]   if you don't have an accountant doing your taxes?
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.740]   And I would amplify that.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.500]   Even if you do have an accountant doing your taxes,
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.260]   he or she may not be doing forward looking.
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.580]   - Yeah, accountants aren't the best
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.300]   at tax planning all the time.
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.300]   A lot of them just like to do the returns.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.020]   And plus they don't know your big picture.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.060]   Yeah, the problem is tax planning can't be done in a void.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:36.260]   Tax planning really comes into play with income planning
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.880]   and with your investment planning.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.900]   So it all fits together.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.740]   And so what I would recommend for people
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.780]   who just want like a one-time thing,
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.700]   have a hourly financial planner,
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.540]   do a comprehensive financial plan.
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:51.140]   You're gonna pay a couple thousand dollars for that,
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:53.800]   but it can be invaluable to make sure
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.700]   that you're doing everything right
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.140]   and that they're identifying,
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.260]   not just the tax planning for that year,
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.260]   but making certain that you're thinking out
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.180]   for the next five to 10 years.
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.300]   Problem with accountants is they love to save you taxes today
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.300]   but they're not always thinking about the tax planning
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.660]   for the future too.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.580]   So that if you wanna continue to do it yourself
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.220]   along the way, that would be my suggestion for that.
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.040]   - Okay, and then a couple of small board questions.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.420]   When you said forgetting to homestead,
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:22.960]   I was like, what does homestead mean?
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.600]   So this is the question, it's not for me,
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.440]   but someone else.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.260]   - No, that's all right.
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:29.020]   So every state's different,
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:32.700]   but homesteading means this is where I call home,
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.420]   this is my domicile, this is where I live.
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:39.220]   And you can only have one homestead.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.660]   And so some states homestead provides no protection,
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:45.420]   but most states it provides some protection
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:48.140]   and so it protects those assets against lawsuits.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:51.340]   So just Google in your state, should I homestead my home?
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:53.020]   Some states it doesn't make a difference,
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:54.040]   but most it does.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.500]   - Okay, last question, another kind of small board question
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.200]   related to one of the mistakes you mentioned.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.340]   You talked about that form 8606
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:05.020]   that goes with the non-deductible IRA contributions.
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.420]   What is the preferred method to correct
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.740]   a missed or incorrect 8606?
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:13.900]   - The beautiful thing is you just have to file a new 8606
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.740]   with your next tax return.
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:19.140]   And then make sure for yourself and your own documents
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.460]   that you have everything to support
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.880]   what you put in that new 8606
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.520]   and keep it straight going forward.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.640]   - Okay, Carolyn, you are amazing.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.220]   Thank you so much for being here to speak with us today.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.060]   Thank you.
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:32.760]   (audience applauding)
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.880]   - I hope I didn't scare the hell out of everybody,
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.440]   but I hope I scared you a little to make sure
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.440]   that when it's time to get help
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.540]   that you guys really do get help.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:45.700]   (audience applauding)
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.760]   you
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:57.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
