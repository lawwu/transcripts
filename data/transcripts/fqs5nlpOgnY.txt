[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   We have multiple aspects where simulation could be useful. So for instance, what would our robot do
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.040]   if a forklift just dropped in front of it suddenly? Like, how would it behave? So we could
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.400]   test that in our simulation environment. And what we did is whenever we found this need for testing
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.760]   such scenarios, you can imagine them as like driving tests. We were inspired by the Karla
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.560]   simulator for autonomous driving. They had some kind of scenario definition so you can define
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.840]   what you want to happen in a simulation environment so it can be automatically run on with your
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:46.320]   robots. We adapted that for factory settings and for AMRs. And now we have our own kind of language
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.520]   where we can say, send this robot from this location to this other location, and while it's
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.000]   driving, just make a forklift drive around randomly the living objects and let's see what happens in
