[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.720]   All right, let's do one more question about deep work.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.120]   This one comes from Mr. S.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:19.440]   Mr. S asks, what do you do when your boss has allocated you to a team halftime?
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.560]   He elaborates, I worked full-time on one team for my current employer.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.760]   My boss has decided that we need to start on a new effort and has put me
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.320]   and one other person to work on this new effort.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.640]   We were supposed to spend half our time on this new project and the other half
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.960]   on our old team, but I feel like I'm still allocated 100% to both teams now.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.440]   It's exhausting.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.400]   All right, Mr. S, here's my suggestion.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.280]   Ask your boss specifically which half of my hours do you want me working on the new team?
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.240]   50% as an abstract number means nothing.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.520]   Should it be the mornings?
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.360]   Should it be the afternoons?
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.720]   Should it be two hours in the morning, two hours in the afternoon?
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.680]   I want the fix down boss, the hours when I'm working on team A and the hours
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.000]   in which I'm working on team B, and I am going to completely segregate these two efforts.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.200]   You give a good reason for it.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.320]   I'm a Cal Newport fan.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.640]   Context switching is better to treat these like two separate jobs as opposed
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.920]   to mixing them together in one job, but then do that and then stick to that.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.640]   If you want to have a meeting related to team A, it has to be scheduled in team A hours.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.040]   If you want a meeting having to do with team B, it has to be scheduled in team B hours.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.040]   If you're going to work on team A, it has to be in team A hours.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.040]   If you're going to work on team B, it has to be in team B hours.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.320]   It could be splitting the day in half.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.680]   It could be splitting the week in half.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.760]   Thursday, Friday is team B.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.520]   Monday, Tuesday is team A, and we split Wednesday down the middle.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.360]   But what you want here is specificity.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.600]   When should this work happen?
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.000]   Now, there is a bigger point here I want to briefly emphasize,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.040]   which is that in knowledge work writ large,
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.880]   a real issue we have is this push model of work allocation,
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.200]   where anyone can push work onto anyone else's plate,
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.520]   where it's up to them to figure out what to do with the mess.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.120]   This is a disaster for overload.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.360]   We get way too much work on our plate because there's no one regulating this.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.120]   There's no one looking at how much is on your plate.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.960]   There's no one saying what is reasonable.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.080]   So we end up with way too much work on our plate.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.560]   Can't make progress on all of it at the same time.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.040]   So that is stressful, but it's not just stressful.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.480]   Each of these things that's now on your plate brings with it some amount of fixed overhead.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.200]   Emails about that work with people checking in,
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.840]   weekly meetings, you've had the schedule to make sure that progress is being made.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.760]   And so when your plate gets full enough,
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.040]   the fixed overhead itself can take over most of your hours,
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.920]   squeezing out almost any of the time to actually get work done.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.040]   So it's a huge problem.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.040]   I'm a big believer in having a much more explicit allocation of work
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.120]   where we think through how much can you do?
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.440]   How much are you doing?
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.800]   Does it make sense to give you something else?
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.640]   I call this a pull-based method because you're basically pulling work into time you have available.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.960]   So you're never oversubscribed,
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.560]   as opposed to a push method where any amount of work can be pushed towards you.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.960]   This is roughly what I'm getting at, Mr. S,
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.760]   when I suggest that you ask your boss what hours
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.440]   what days do you actually want this 50% work to be done?
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.160]   Because what you're doing here is actually forcing
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.920]   work to account for when it's going to get done.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.480]   Well, where are the hours where this is going to get done?
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.240]   That hour is already spoken for.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.200]   You want to have a meeting here,
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   but that hours have already been put aside for this other work.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.480]   So now there's no time for your meeting.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.120]   You're making explicit things take time.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.640]   What time do you want me to give to this?
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.960]   And honestly, I think there should be a bigger effort to do this with more work.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.080]   I wrote about this in a world without email,
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.800]   that when it comes to, for example, service work among professors,
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.320]   that there should be a specific budget.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.760]   Here is how many hours of service work you are allowed to do max per week.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.280]   And when things get assigned to you,
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.040]   you actually have to estimate how many hours you're going to spend on.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.720]   In fact, put those hours aside.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.720]   Here they are on my calendar when I'm working on this.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.520]   If you want to talk to me about this, it's on my public calendar.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.600]   And when those hours are filled up, nothing else can come to you.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.120]   Yes, this would create a problem at first,
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.040]   because there's all these people that want you to do things.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.200]   Like I know your hours are full, but this is important.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.680]   But you know what?
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.360]   That back pressure reforms the system.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.560]   And less of these requests are allowed to be generated.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.000]   And more of these requests generating entities
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   have to figure out other ways to get their work done.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.520]   So I don't mean to go on a big rant here,
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.760]   but the unregulated allocation of work and knowledge work is a disaster.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.000]   It's convenient.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.920]   It's flexible.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.200]   But it is a terrible way to get work done.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.800]   It's like running a car factory where, you know,
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.560]   everyone comes in and you just say,
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.040]   guys, there's a bunch of parts around here, you do you,
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.560]   like we're just going to kind of build cars.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.000]   It's yeah, it's convenient.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.360]   It's flexible, but nothing's going to get done.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.280]   Or if it does, the cars are gonna get built terribly.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.160]   It's gonna take a long time.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.360]   So it's time to start pushing back against the unrestricted allocation of work.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.000]   Mr. S, if your boss wants you to spend 50/50,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.920]   make him tell you what that 50/50 is, make him live by that decision.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.800]   They're now hours he cannot get you to do work for team A because it's team B hours, etc.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.720]   And if he wants to put another thing on your plate,
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.840]   where are those hours coming from?
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.120]   It's time to get explicit.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.480]   Don't just push stuff on my plate.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.360]   I'll pull in what I actually have time for.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.480]   And what we don't have time for is more questions about deep work.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.920]   So let's move on now to some questions about the deep life.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:49.200]   [MUSIC]
