[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   I would like to call your attention this evening to the words found in Paul's epistle to the
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.120]   Romans in chapter 10, reading verses 11, 12 and 13.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.000]   Verses 11, 12 and 13.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.960]   "For the Scripture saith, 'Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.'
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:32.680]   For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek, for the same Lord over all
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.600]   is rich unto all that call upon him.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.640]   For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.760]   Now some of you may remember that when we were taking a general survey of this 10th
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.560]   chapter of this epistle to the Romans, we indicated that these three verses form a kind
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.520]   of subsection on their own.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.360]   This is not of course an absolute division, but it is convenient in order to be able to
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.200]   follow the argument of the great apostle who always moves on from step to step.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.320]   It is a matter of convenience to see where a particular section ends and where he starts
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.080]   with or takes up another.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.960]   Now everybody isn't agreed about this exact division.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.880]   There are those who would include verse 11 with what we've already been considering,
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.720]   especially in verses 9 and 10.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.280]   But it does seem to me that the logical connection is actually between 11, 12 and 13, which I
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.820]   want to try to show you go together.
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.940]   So we are approaching then a new subsection of this whole section, chapter 10, in which
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:58.140]   the apostle is putting his great case as against the Jews, who were criticizing him and other
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.660]   Christian preachers on two main grounds.
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.340]   One, the character of the gospel, which seemed to them to be doing away with the law.
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.820]   And secondly, that they were offering salvation to the Gentiles and didn't seem to be drawing
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.220]   what they regarded as this vital, essential distinction between Jew and Gentile.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.740]   Now that is the great theme of the whole chapter, and we've seen how the apostle has been
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.340]   working out his great argument.
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.260]   And it has brought us especially to this point, that he has shown that the character of saving
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.940]   faith is that—the whole character, I mean in general, I'm here including the content
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.380]   and the characteristics and the proof under this general title—it is that if thou shalt
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.220]   confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.340]   raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.020]   Then in explanation of that he says, "For, as a matter of fact, it is with the heart
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.020]   that men believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:15.980]   Well now, he wants to establish that still further, and he does it, as we shall now see,
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.420]   in the way that is so characteristic of him.
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:27.060]   I cannot refrain from remarking once more as to what a fascinating thing it is to watch
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.540]   the working of the mind of this great and mighty man, the apostle Paul.
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.260]   We can learn from this man in every respect, not only the actual truth that he imparts
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.980]   to us, but his method of conveying it and of presenting it.
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.260]   It is to me one of the most remarkable things.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.260]   I know of nothing that is more stimulating to the mind than to try to follow this man
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.060]   and to observe his method.
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.940]   And he has here, of course, and does here, what we have seen him doing so many, many
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:09.540]   times in this epistle, and which is, of course, for all time, the model of what this kind
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.860]   of Christian apologetic, if you like, should be.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:23.380]   So we find that what he does is this, is that he makes a statement, and we have been considering
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.860]   it in verses nine and ten.
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.940]   Now, how can he really prove this?
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.580]   How can he bring this especially right home to the Jews?
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.660]   There is only one way to do so, and that is a quotation from the Scriptures.
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.900]   So you see, we have here in verse eleven a scriptural quotation, the Scripture says,
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.900]   then the statement.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.540]   Then in verse twelve, he goes on to make a comment on that again.
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:58.380]   And then he ends with a final, ultimate quotation from Scripture to settle the whole matter.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.740]   But as we shall see, in moving from step to step, though on the surface he seems to be
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.320]   repeating himself, we will find that he is not repeating himself exactly.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.820]   He never makes an exact repetition, he always adds just something further, something else
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:25.100]   strikes him and grips him, and so he takes the argument further, lifts it, if you like,
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.540]   to a still higher level.
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:34.300]   Now, as we approach what the Apostle does here, it seems to me to be very important
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.980]   that we must once more revert to Paul's use of the Scripture.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:47.180]   I have commented on this before, but he does it so repeatedly that we must indeed comment
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.700]   upon it once more.
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:59.580]   Now, this is his invariable method, I say, of establishing a point.
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.700]   And of course, in particular, when he was dealing with the Jews.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:10.180]   He reminds us in 1 Corinthians 9 that he has been made all things to all men, to them that
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.900]   are under the law, as under the law, to them who are not under the law, without the law,
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.060]   as himself without the law.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.060]   He has got a great message, yes, but it is his business as a preacher and a teacher to
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:29.700]   present it in the way that makes it most acceptable to the particular people whom he is addressing.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:37.540]   The Apostle Paul, unlike certain preachers, always preached to his congregation.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:43.580]   Now I suppose it is in particular the danger of young preachers to forget their congregations.
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.780]   They have been sitting in a study and they have been reading books, and they have been
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.100]   living in that realm.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.820]   Their great danger is, when they go into a pulpit, to preach the thing that interests
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.380]   them and they don't preach to the people who are actually sitting in the pews and listening
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.380]   to them.
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.860]   That is very bad preaching.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.020]   It may show a great knowledge of theology and of the Bible, but it is thoroughly bad
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.020]   preaching.
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.460]   A man who doesn't preach to his congregation should never enter a pulpit.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.500]   The business of preaching is to convey the truth to the people who come to listen.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.620]   And the Apostle is a wonderful preacher.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:27.060]   And as he has got his eye here primarily upon the Jews, he knows that there is no argument
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.340]   that is to be so convincing to a Jew, and which is indeed unanswerable to a Jew, if
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.220]   you are quite honest, as a quotation from the Scriptures.
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.860]   So he brings out his scriptural quotations.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:53.780]   Now what he says here, in effect, is this, that the Jews were entirely without excuse,
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:08:01.540]   because the Scriptures of which they boasted so much, the oracles of God, in which they
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.940]   delighted so much, and of which they were so proud, those very Scriptures and oracles
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:14.180]   of God had already said the very thing that he and others are preaching now as the Christian
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.180]   Gospel.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:21.940]   And thereby, you see, he establishes that their real trouble was that they were blinded
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.540]   to their own Scriptures.
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:29.740]   Now you remember, many of you, how he makes that point in the third chapter of the second
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.860]   epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.860]   He says the whole trouble with the Jews is that there is a veil over their heart.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.900]   He says the Scriptures are read to them every Sunday.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.660]   But they don't understand them, he says.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:50.740]   Even unto this day when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.940]   Now he is saying exactly the same thing here in effect.
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:57.580]   He isn't putting it as explicitly, but that is what the effect of his argument is.
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:02.780]   He says, "I've been saying to you that it is with the heart that men believeth unto
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.780]   salvation."
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.020]   But this is a question of faith, not of works.
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:12.900]   And he says, "I'm regarded as an innovator, as if I'd propounded some strange new doctrine
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.900]   of my own."
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.900]   But he says this is the Scripture.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:23.380]   It is the Scripture that says, "Whoever believeth in him shall not be confounded."
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.060]   So that here he undermines the whole position of the Jew.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:33.660]   He shows that he is not only without excuse, but that he has been blinded in his mind and
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:40.220]   in his heart, and particularly in his heart to the truth of the Scriptures which he revered
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.220]   so much.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:48.420]   And therefore, secondly, and incidentally, the apostle is able to prove and to establish
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:54.020]   the truth of his own message and the message of the other apostles and preachers of the
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:10:01.060]   Christian gospel, that it is not some new doctrine, that it is the fulfillment of all
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.020]   that had been prophesied and predicted in their own Scriptures.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.220]   Well now, you see, we've already found the apostle doing this in many places.
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:17.860]   There's a very notable example of this selfsame thing in the third chapter, where he brings
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:23.820]   in his first grand statement of the gospel in the twenty-first verse, having said that
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.540]   by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight, for by the law
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.180]   is the knowledge of sin.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:38.300]   He says, "But now," here's this new thing, "but now the righteousness of God, apart
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.100]   from the law, without the law, is manifested."
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:48.140]   But notice, "being witnessed by the law and the prophets."
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.460]   How careful he is to say that.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:11:00.500]   He says, "What I'm preaching as this gospel has been witnessed unto by the law and the
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.500]   prophets."
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.660]   And he was constantly making that point.
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.660]   And it's so important that we should remember this.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:13.180]   It was, of course, the essence of his method of evangelizing the Jews.
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.300]   Now there's a very good summary account of his method at the beginning of the seventeenth
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.980]   chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.860]   Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica,
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.340]   where was a synod of the Jews.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:32.060]   And listen, "And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three Sabbath days
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:38.100]   reasoned with them out of the Scriptures, opening and alleging that Christ must needs
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:44.860]   have suffered and risen again from the dead, and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.420]   is Christ."
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.420]   That was his method.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.700]   And he's doing exactly the same thing here.
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.820]   It's the best method of evangelism with such people.
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.920]   It is also the best method of explaining your gospel, defending your gospel.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.900]   This great kind of apologia, as I say, for the gospel.
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.700]   And when you're dealing with Jews, there is nothing that is more effective.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:17.140]   Now, he's done, of course, the same thing exactly as we saw right through chapter nine.
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:21.660]   One final comment about the way in which the apostle does this.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:30.320]   You notice that he always has the exact right quotation.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.320]   That's the wonderful thing.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.040]   We've got two of them here in this little subsection.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.160]   And to use the modern phrase, they're dead on.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:45.600]   Now, I've often heard people quoting scriptures, but they seem to me to have been almost irrelevant
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.820]   to the particular matter at hand.
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:52.400]   You don't help the friend whom you're trying to help by merely quoting scriptures
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.400]   if they're not relevant to the matter that's being discussed.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:03.120]   So let's make sure that our quotations are always apposite and always relevant to the
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.120]   particular matter with which we are dealing.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.240]   Well, now then, there is what we see as we look at the apostle's method.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:15.540]   Let us pause for a moment to make sure that we really are learning this lesson, which
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.720]   we should learn from the great apostle.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.640]   Our methods are very important.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.520]   The message is the first thing, but the methods are also tremendously important.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:34.120]   And we are to be apostolic and New Testament in our methods as well as with regard to our
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.840]   message.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:43.160]   And therefore, we must always learn to pay attention to the exact position of the person
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.240]   to whom we are speaking.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:55.080]   And we must handle them and present our message to them according to their state and condition.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:01.720]   As I say, the most perfect sermon in the world is not of the slightest value if it isn't
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.360]   being understood by the people whom you're addressing.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.160]   You may prepare a wonderful philosophic sermon or theological sermon, but if the people who
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.520]   are listening to you don't know the elements of philosophy or theology, you're wasting
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.960]   your breath, you're wasting your energy, you're wasting your time.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:22.800]   Here was a man who could speak on Mars Hill in Athens, and he was equally able to evangelize
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:28.960]   the Galatians and the servants and the soldiers in Caesar's household.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:36.360]   Very well, we must learn this, and at the same time, we must know our scriptures.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:42.280]   Now this is particularly helpful and important for us, not only when we may be speaking to
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.160]   Jews who still follow the Jews' religion today.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:52.720]   I think it is very valuable when we are dealing with nominal Christians, when we are dealing
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.760]   with people who are members of churches, but who don't seem to understand very much about
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:02.120]   the gospel, and who don't give much evidence in their lives that they're truly Christian.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.360]   But if they do claim to be Christian, they therefore make a claim that the Bible is their
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.360]   book.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:13.040]   Very well, there is nothing more effective in dealing with them than to know your scriptures
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.320]   in such a way and in such a manner that you can give a relevant quotation.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.080]   Because what they're likely to say, and they do say, as we all know, "Ah," they say, "but
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.040]   that's only your opinion."
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.800]   But you say, "It isn't my opinion."
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.900]   Listen, and you have your apt quotation.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.360]   And if they then claim to believe in any sense in the authority of the scriptures, they've
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.000]   got to pay attention to you.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.200]   And you will often find that such people are in trouble because they don't know their own
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.200]   scriptures.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:47.560]   So if we can take them and give this precise quotation that is needed at that point, it
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.640]   will be of great help to them, and it will aid us in doing our work.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:56.360]   Let's know our scriptures, therefore, and let's always be sure that we select the one
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.200]   that is most appropriate.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.000]   But another lesson that we learn here is this, and this is a general one, not so much about
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.920]   our method, but doesn't it open our eyes again to the glory of the scriptures?
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.360]   You see, the scriptures are one.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:18.380]   This gospel is attested to by Moses and the prophets, by the law and the prophets.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.600]   It was the Holy Spirit that led the early church to keep the Old Testament.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.040]   The temptation obviously was to say, "Now then, that belonged to the Jews, that was
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.200]   the old religion.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.600]   We've got something absolutely new.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.160]   We don't need the Old Testament."
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.200]   There are many foolish people who say that today.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.920]   I've heard foolish Christian people saying that, "I'm not interested in the Old Testament."
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.880]   What a tragedy.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.080]   You see, there is a unity in the whole of the scriptures.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.440]   So the apostle is able to establish the point that he's making as a New Testament preacher
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.640]   by an Old Testament quotation.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.600]   It shows us the grand unity of the scriptures.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:03.880]   Not only that, it shows us this, that as what is preached under the gospel was predicted
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:11.700]   and prophesied under the Old Testament dispensation, it is proof positive that God has a great
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:18.600]   plan and purpose of salvation, and that nothing that is recorded in the New Testament happened
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.280]   by accident.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:28.160]   It is all a part and a part working of God's great purpose and plan and scheme of redemption
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.520]   and of salvation.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.720]   The fact is, as this apostle of all others is so constantly reminding us, that this is
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.680]   the plan which is foreordained before the foundation of the world.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:43.420]   Well, I say this apostle in particular, but that reading from Peter at the beginning,
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:48.280]   we found Peter saying exactly the same thing, who verily was foreordained before the foundation
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:54.320]   of the world, but has been manifested in these last times for you, who by him do believe
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.160]   in God who raised him from the dead.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.320]   I don't know what you feel, I find this very thrilling.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.520]   The whole thing is one.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.760]   I know there are all these books, but there is this absolute unity.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.760]   Why?
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:15.160]   Well, because this is nothing but the unfolding of God's great eternal plan and purpose.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.480]   He foretold it in the Old Testament.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.480]   He indicated what he was going to do, and he kept on doing so in parts and portions.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:28.760]   Then the great event happens, and you get the glorious fulfillment of the prophecies
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.040]   in the New Testament Scriptures.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:38.920]   All the promises of God in him are "Yea, and in him are Amen, and to the glory of God."
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.440]   So that leads me to a further statement.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.660]   It all comes out of this quotation.
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:50.000]   It is an absolute proof of the inspiration of the Scripture.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.200]   There is no other explanation of it.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.440]   The doctrine of the inspiration of the Scripture follows a necessity from this.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:03.800]   Here is the apostle quoting the prophet Isaiah, who lived eight centuries before Christ was
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   born.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.740]   How could he possibly have foretold this?
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:15.360]   This element of foretelling in prophecy is one of the greatest arguments and proofs of
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:21.280]   the divine inspiration and inerrancy of the Scripture, and therefore the authority of
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.600]   the Bible as a whole.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.560]   It is a proof positive of it.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:31.560]   All these details prophesied in parts and portions, here they are all fulfilled.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:37.160]   Well, again, the apostle Peter, you see, he uses that argument in his second epistle and
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.600]   in the first chapter.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.560]   He says, listen to what I am saying.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.000]   He says, "I was with James and John on the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.560]   We saw him transfigured, we heard the voice from the excellent glory speaking.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.440]   We are eyewitnesses of his glory.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:57.680]   But," he says, "we have also a word of prophecy made yet more sure."
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:04.440]   That is even more important, he says, more important than my testimony, is the fact that
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:11.160]   in this person the word of prophecy has been verified, it has been made more sure, it has
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:17.520]   been substantiated, it has been proved to be the word of God.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:23.440]   Now then, you see, the very quotation here by the apostle, which he uses to substantiate
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:30.600]   what he has been saying, leads us immediately into this whole matter of the character and
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:36.920]   the nature of the scripture, and how our faith tonight is not dependent either upon our feelings
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:43.200]   or moods or states, or what we may be doing or not doing, but upon the infallible word
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:50.720]   of God, so that we are immune from all the changing fashions in theology and all that
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.720]   is happening round and about us at the present time.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:04.520]   We look back at this great unity, this great unfolding purpose, determined, indicated,
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.240]   put into practice, and yet to be put into practice.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:15.160]   And whatever may be happening round and about us, I say, we plant our feet firmly, securely,
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.560]   steadfastly, and unshakably upon the word of God.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:25.840]   Well, that is the sort of thing a quotation of scripture sometimes says to me.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:31.720]   Let us thank God for it, my friends, and that God in his infinite grace and kindness has
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:37.320]   stooped to our weakness, and that he comes to us and helps us in this particular way.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.320]   Very well.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.360]   Now then, let us come to the actual verse, verse 11.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:49.360]   For the scripture saith, "Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:58.720]   Now, here I say is a quotation from Isaiah, chapter 28 and verse 16.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:05.480]   And it is, and has always been, recognized as one of the great messianic prophecies in
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.560]   the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:12.480]   Some people call Isaiah the evangelical prophet.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:18.520]   I suppose in a sense that is quite a justifiable way of describing him, because he certainly
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:27.560]   has the gospel in some of its most glorious expressions in various parts of his long book.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:35.960]   And here in this 28th chapter, there is this remarkable statement of the salvation, the
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.920]   deliverance that was to come.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.880]   Now, we remember, don't we, that the way to approach the teaching of the prophets is
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.800]   always this.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:51.480]   The prophets had two objects in view when they wrote.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:56.720]   First and foremost, they had the immediate conditions which they were facing.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.840]   Again, let us remember that the prophets were wonderful teachers too, and they preached
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.240]   to the people of their own day and age and generation.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.400]   And they dealt with the local circumstances and conditions, and they had a direct message
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.400]   with regard to them.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.440]   But that wasn't the only thing.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:21.840]   In that and through that, the prophet, by the Spirit of God which leads him, is led
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:27.720]   to see a picture of something yet greater and in a yet higher realm.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.040]   Well, I mean something like this.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:35.320]   The prophet deals with the religious moral decline of the nation and how God is going
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.200]   to raise up an enemy to conquer them and to chastise them, and there they are in trouble.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.600]   Yes, but they are going to be delivered.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.640]   Now, that is true, and he has got a message about that, but he says there is something
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.640]   bigger here.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:53.480]   This is a parable also of the great spiritual salvation which God is going to send for his
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.480]   own people.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:01.000]   So, you have got a perfect example of all that in the 28th chapter of Isaiah's prophecy.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.440]   Let me just read a few verses beginning at verse 14.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.640]   "Wherefore, hear the word of the Lord, ye scornful men that rule this people which is
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.040]   in Jerusalem, because ye have said, 'We have made a covenant with death, and with
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.400]   hell are we at agreement.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.040]   When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us, for we have made
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:27.480]   lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.'
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:39.600]   Therefore, thus saith the Lord God, 'Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a stone, a
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:45.800]   tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.960]   He that believeth shall not make haste.'"
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.640]   Now, that is what the apostle is quoting.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:00.280]   He quotes it as is the custom with him from the Septuagint translation, so we have it
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:07.800]   translated here, "Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:14.880]   And sometimes it is translated, "Whosoever believeth in him shall not be confounded."
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.960]   But the principle, the essence of the message is exactly the same.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:27.600]   And I say that this is one of the great foreshadowings in the prophet Isaiah of the coming of the
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:35.320]   Son of God, and the great and the glorious salvation that is going to come in and through
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.320]   him.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.080]   And that is why, you see, the apostle has already quoted it at the end of the ninth
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:46.360]   chapter of this epistle to the Romans, verse 33, as it is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:51.920]   a stumbling stone and rock of a fence, and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.120]   We just glanced at it there because what was being stressed there particularly was that
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.600]   he was a stumbling stone and a rock of a fence to the Jews.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.520]   Here, he takes up the other side.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.560]   And as I have already shown you, the apostle Peter quotes it in his first epistle, chapter
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.920]   2, and in verse 6.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.400]   Very well.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.600]   What does this quotation prove?
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:20.680]   Well, once more, you see, it just gives us the whole essence of the gospel.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.240]   That is what Paul is out to prove here.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.240]   He has said that "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.840]   in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.840]   Very well.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:39.160]   He is now out to show that this quotation has already foretold that.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:47.840]   So the first thing he wants to establish is this, that it is believing that matters.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:56.160]   "Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:03.400]   In other words, he says, the evangelical prophet reminds us that the character of this great
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:10.280]   salvation when it comes will be that it is not a matter of works or of observation of
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:20.960]   the details and the minutiae of the law, but the believing on this stone that God himself
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.080]   is going to lay in Zion.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:28.960]   Well, now you see at once that the apostle is back again on to what is, of course, the
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:34.160]   central main theme of the whole of this epistle to the Romans, which he has already announced
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.520]   in the 17th verse of the first chapter.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.880]   "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:49.000]   to every one that believeth," he says in verse 16, "unto the Jew first, also to the Greek."
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.680]   You see, he is really, well, of course, I was going to say he has really said it all,
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:28:00.000]   but he hasn't in this sense, that in the introduction to his epistles, he, like many
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.080]   great musical composers, in his overture gives the leading themes, which he is going to take
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.920]   up and expand, and there he has thrown it out at the very beginning.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:16.280]   This is the characteristic, this is the thing of which he is proud, "for therein is the
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:22.880]   righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, 'The just shall
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   live by faith.'"
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.280]   That is the essence of the gospel.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.960]   That is the thing the Jews were stumbling at.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:33.600]   So again, as he deals with this matter for the last time, and well, he wants to prove
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:42.560]   it to the hilt, out he brings this quotation, "whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.600]   In other words, it is believing on him or not believing on him that determines one's
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:53.360]   salvation and not going about to establish one's own righteousness, going about to produce
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:29:00.480]   works or this or that, putting it on anything but on this question of the belief.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:07.880]   Very well then, he says, "the believing is the thing that was prophesied and emphasized
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:14.360]   there by the prophet," and he says, "that's all, that's exactly what I've been saying,
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:19.720]   that's my argument, that's my preaching, that is the very essence of my gospel."
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:25.480]   He says, "my gospel is this, that God has done something."
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:32.160]   "Isaiah said he would, 'Thus saith the Lord God, 'Behold, I lay in Zion.'"
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.040]   Very well, says Paul, he's done that.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:42.560]   And therefore, it is obvious, he says, that salvation is not something that man does,
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.360]   it's God who provides the salvation.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.040]   God says, "You scoffers in Jerusalem, you were saying, 'Let the floods come, it's all
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.920]   right, we've taken our refuge in lies, we've made a covenant with death, we're all right,
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.360]   let anything come that may come.'
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:03.240]   Listen," says God, "I am going to show and lay down the only way of escape."
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:10.000]   So escape is something that comes to us simply by availing ourselves of what God has done,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.120]   believing on him.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:18.940]   It takes it right out of us, and any confidence in ourselves, or anything that we may chance
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:26.040]   to have or not have, all that is immediately removed and abolished, it is believing on
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:31.280]   the salvation that God has provided.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:37.640]   But you see, that reminds us of what God has provided.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:44.800]   So now he is showing how this quotation from Isaiah 28, 16 is also saying that it is the
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:50.240]   man who confesses with his mouth that Jesus is Lord, and who believes in his heart that
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.440]   God has raised him from the dead, is the man who is saved.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.240]   What is the essence of the message?
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:01.320]   Well, "Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.600]   Well who is he?
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:17.160]   Well the he on whom we believe is this stone, this tried, precious stone that God says,
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.360]   'I am going to lay in Zion.'
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.680]   And here you see you come at once to the essence of the gospel message.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.200]   Peter puts it in exactly the same way.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:37.800]   "To whom coming as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious,
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:43.440]   ye also as lively stones, have built up a spiritual house, that ye may offer spiritual
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:52.320]   sacrifices to God, acceptable in Jesus Christ, as it is written, 'Behold, I lay in Zion,
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:58.560]   a chief's cornerstone, elect, precious, and whosoever believeth in him shall not be
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.560]   confounded.'"
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.240]   And Peter is saying exactly what the Apostle Paul is saying here.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:09.840]   That was nothing but a prophecy concerning our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.360]   "Whosoever believeth on him," who is he?
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:19.160]   Oh, here we've got a very precious stone.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.440]   Here we've got a tried stone.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:27.720]   Here we've got a stone that is really capable of bearing the weight that shall be put upon
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.720]   it.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.240]   The whole edifice can rest upon this cornerstone.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.160]   It's been tried, it's been tested.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:40.600]   Yes, the stresses and the strains of the whole building, they're known to this architect
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.640]   and he knows that this stone is able to take them and to bear them.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:49.160]   It's a tried stone and it is a precious stone.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.000]   And that is the one on whom we believe.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   And this is none other than the Son of God.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.200]   Precious.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:05.160]   Precious because he is the Son of God.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.640]   He is the Lord.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:12.600]   If thou shalt confess with thy mouth that Jesus is Lord, precious.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.160]   Yes, this is not a man only.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.340]   This person is unique.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:21.640]   This is God's only begotten, dearly beloved Son.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.360]   This is one who is precious in the eyes of God.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:29.600]   He is God the Son who is ever eternally in the bosom of the Father.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.560]   This precious Son of God, unique, separate.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.440]   This is God's salvation.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:40.280]   This is what we are told we must believe on.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:48.160]   This precious stone that God himself is going to lay.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.240]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.720]   That's God laying in Zion this stone.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:00.360]   When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman made under
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.360]   the law.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.280]   That's setting the stone in Zion.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.760]   All the action of God.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.480]   God has laid him.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.480]   Not men.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   It's all from God's side.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.440]   It's God's salvation.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.920]   And you see God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, the most precious
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.580]   of all God's possessions.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:23.580]   He gave him.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:32.320]   He has put him there as the means of salvation, the way of escape.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:39.000]   But he's also a tried stone, not only precious but tried.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.120]   And we know what that means.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:47.240]   Perfectly adapted to all that he has to do.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:53.040]   We need the strength of the eternal God to save us, but he must also be a man.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.680]   So he was born of a woman.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.480]   So the incarnation takes place.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.000]   So we believe in the virgin birth.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.440]   So we believe that he really had a true human body and a true human soul.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.440]   Truly man.
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.120]   He must be.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:18.960]   This salvation that God is going to set there must be perfectly adapted to the needs, the
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.400]   needs of all men.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:26.400]   And he is tried in every respect in his person.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:33.360]   And then in this world, able to render a perfect obedience to God's law, so that at the end
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.560]   he could say, "Who is it that can bring a charge against me?"
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.400]   He says, "The enemy is going to come, but he shan't find anything in me."
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.760]   And nobody was able to bring any charge against him that could be substantiated.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.000]   He rendered a perfect obedience to God's law.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.360]   Yes, but also tempted in all points like as we are.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.340]   He was tried to the uttermost.
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:01.760]   He was led of the spirit up into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:09.120]   Tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:17.680]   And so he experienced life as you and I experience it, with all its contradictions and its disappointments
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.040]   and everything else.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:25.300]   But then there comes the greatest moment of trial of all.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:29.000]   The wages of sin is death.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.700]   Can he bear the weight of the sins and the guilt of the sins of men?
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.360]   Can he stand this test?
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:42.120]   Can he take the punishment decreed by the law?
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:46.320]   Can he bear this punishment and still come out victorious?
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.760]   He's been tried.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:55.400]   He was tried in the garden of Gethsemane, and that trial caused him to sweat great drops
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.680]   of blood, but he went through.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:03.440]   If it be possible, nevertheless, not my will but thine be done.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:08.520]   And on the cross he bore the wrath of God against sin.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:14.120]   His heart was broken and he died, but he rose triumphant o'er the grave.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.240]   A tried still.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:23.600]   Yes, he has met every single need of men in sin.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.480]   There is nothing but that he has accomplished it.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.120]   He has borne it all.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.680]   He's a precious stone.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.720]   He is a tried stone.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:45.280]   And he has succeeded in bearing this weight of the salvation of men.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:53.720]   So you see, it comes to pass that the way of salvation is to believe on him.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.720]   We can do nothing.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.720]   We are all condemned.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.480]   We are all sinners.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.360]   We are all without strength.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:04.560]   While we were yet without strength in due time, Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.840]   Can't you see this, says the apostle?
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.960]   The scripture saw it all coming.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:15.120]   If God doesn't lay this tried precious stone in Zion, there is no salvation.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.120]   We can't do it.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.120]   Nobody can.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.120]   God's going to do it.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:23.520]   And all we do is to believe on him.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:29.160]   And believe on him because it is God who has laid him there.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.760]   And because he is who and what he is.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.200]   Because Jesus is the Lord.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:44.120]   And because Jesus did bear the punishment of our sins and was dead and was buried, but
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.960]   God raised him again from the dead.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.480]   This thing that we've got to believe in our hearts.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:54.000]   And it's all summarized here.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.720]   Believing on him, yes, but in terms of what the prophet Isaiah stated in greater fullness.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:06.240]   The apostle puts it like this, knowing that they'll have the full context in mind.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:15.880]   And so the way of salvation is entirely taken away from us.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:28.520]   And what we are called upon to do is to believe on him, the tried precious, conquering, infallible,
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:37.840]   stone son of God, who bears the weight of salvation himself and is thereby able to give
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.960]   it to those who believe on him.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:46.200]   Very well, I'm afraid we've got to leave it at that tonight.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:51.920]   That doesn't exhaust this matter which is put before us in this eleventh verse, but
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:56.720]   I don't want to rush the glorious way in which the apostle puts it.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.280]   Let that be sufficient for tonight.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:07.000]   Because this is the salvation, in other words, because he is the salvation, what matters
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:14.200]   supremely and only is, do we believe on him?
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:19.400]   If we do, we shall never be ashamed.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:24.560]   If we don't, we shall be eternally lost.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.240]   Let us pray.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:34.880]   O Lord our God, we do indeed come to thank thee for this so great salvation, for the
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:39.400]   marvel, the wonder, and the glory of it all.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:45.200]   Lord we humbly thank thee that it is thine, and that therefore thine must be all the honor
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.880]   and all the glory and all the praise.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:54.520]   Thy word has taught us, him that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:41:01.520]   And we thank thee that we have seen again tonight how inevitable this is, that we are
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:10.640]   what we are, entirely and utterly and solely by the grace of God, through Jesus Christ
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.400]   our Lord.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:18.240]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God, and the fellowship and
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:24.800]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:33.320]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and evermore.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.240]   Amen.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.160]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
