[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   I turn once more to a consideration of the fifteenth verse in the eighth chapter of Paul's
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.080]   epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.040]   "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.440]   of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father."
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.360]   Now we are still really engaged upon the first half of this verse.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:33.240]   "Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear."
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.760]   I would remind you that this is a most important statement because it is a part of the evidence
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:47.200]   which is given to us by the apostle on which we can be sure and certain of our salvation,
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.960]   especially of our sonship.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.000]   He is providing us here with proofs of sonship, and the first was of course the statement
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.960]   of the fourteenth verse where we read, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.200]   are the sons of God."
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.920]   But that is not the only proof.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.360]   There is a second proof, and that is that we no longer have the spirit of bondage to
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.000]   fear.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.880]   Now we were dealing with this partly last Friday evening, and this is what we found,
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.420]   that the spirit here in both parts of the verse is the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.920]   It isn't a mere feeling or disposition.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.000]   He is saying that the Holy Spirit is not again giving you a spirit of bondage, but he is
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.520]   giving you now a spirit of adoption.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.040]   So we interpreted this spirit of bondage again to fear as meaning this, that it is the work
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.120]   of the Holy Spirit in convicting us of sin.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.480]   It is the Holy Spirit applying the law to us.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:04.240]   It is the Spirit bringing us to see that the law of God is good and holy and spiritual,
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.680]   and so thereby bringing us to see our own sinfulness, our own helplessness, and our
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.600]   own hopelessness.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:21.960]   So we ended by giving an account of what are the manifestations of this spirit of bondage
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.600]   and of fear.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.360]   Now then, we go on to the next point, as I indicated at the end last Friday, and the
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.160]   next point is this, that according to this teaching, therefore, the spirit of bondage
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.960]   always precedes the spirit of adoption.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.040]   Now the way the apostle puts it suggests that at once you have not received again, he says,
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.280]   the spirit of bondage to fear.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.000]   You did receive it once, but you no longer got that.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.480]   You have received another spirit, the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.760]   Now here, of course, is a most important proposition.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.560]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:18.360]   This negative statement, therefore, is in and of itself one of the tests which we apply
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.560]   to prove that we really are in the position of sons.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:34.080]   Because I would argue that nobody ever receives the spirit of bondage and of fear save those
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.720]   who are chosen unto salvation.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:44.000]   It is the first and the preliminary work of the Spirit in bringing us to salvation.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.580]   But you may say, "What of people who have often been frightened under the preaching
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.580]   of the gospel?"
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.560]   Well, my reply would be that still they have not known the spirit of bondage again to fear.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.320]   They have known a kind of temporary alarm.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.600]   The same thing happens to such people when they go and look at a very dramatic play or
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   drama.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.000]   They can be terrified by some powerful impulse.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.520]   But every fear is not this spirit of bondage again to fear.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:23.640]   This as we saw last Friday night has got certain definite and peculiar characteristics, among
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.320]   which are a very real sense of sin.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.520]   It isn't merely the fear of hell.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.120]   It is a kind of fear of the holiness of God.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.480]   It is a fear of our own inward corruption and sinful black hearts and the other things
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.480]   that we enumerated.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.640]   So I would argue that the only people who have ever known truly the spirit of bondage
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.680]   again to fear are those who have truly been convicted by the Spirit and have seen the
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.600]   spirituality of the law and the consequences that follow from that.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:10.440]   But also it seems to me that this negative statement is of great value also in testing
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.720]   the spirits, because we are aware of the fact that we have an antagonist, an accuser of
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:25.120]   the brethren, an adversary, and he would often persuade us that we have the spirit of adoption
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.760]   when we may not have the spirit of adoption at all.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.080]   The devil will certainly enable people to feel a certain amount of happiness if he thinks
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.440]   that thereby he can put them into a kind of carnal security, which will mean that they
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.320]   are no longer concerned about their salvation.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.080]   It is therefore important, as we saw, if we had read the earlier part of the fourth chapter
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.280]   of John's first epistle, we would have seen that he exhorts us to test and to prove the
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.520]   spirits, that every spirit is not of God.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.320]   And the devil sometimes persuades people that they are saved people, that they are Christians,
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.320]   that they are sons of God.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.000]   And therefore it is very important to be able to differentiate between the Holy Spirit giving
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.440]   the true spirit of adoption and the counterfeit of the devil.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:22.360]   Now what I am saying is this, that this spirit of bondage and of fear is a very valuable
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.000]   test in that respect.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.400]   If we have never known the spirit of bondage and of fear, well then I suggest we had better
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:41.640]   very examine very carefully what may appear at first sight to be the spirit of adoption.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:47.840]   I am laying down this proposition, you see, that the spirit of bondage always precedes
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.320]   the spirit of adoption.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.800]   Now let me put this to you by reading you some words of John Preston, to whom I referred
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.200]   last Friday evening, one of the early Puritans, one of the greatest and the ablest of them,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.640]   the man who was at one time chaplain to James I and Charles I.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:15.880]   He puts it like this, "If thou never hadst the spirit of bondage, certainly thou hast
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.160]   not yet received the spirit of the Son.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.200]   For the apostle speaks of it here as the common condition to all Christians.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.360]   They do not receive the spirit of bondage again.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.240]   You had it once, but now you have the spirit of adoption.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:41.560]   I say every man must have this spirit of bondage and the ground of it is this, because no man
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:48.200]   can come to Christ except the law be a schoolmaster to bring him to Christ."
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:56.080]   And then he says, "And there is very great reason for it, because otherwise we should
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.960]   never know the love of Christ.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.880]   He that hath not known what the spirit of bondage is, what those fears are, what the
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:10.360]   terrors of conscience are in some measure, knows not what Christ hath suffered for him,
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.440]   nor what deliverance he hath had by him.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.880]   Besides, he will not be appliable to Christ."
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.680]   Now that's how John Preston puts it.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.800]   You see what he means is more or less this.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.680]   He says, "Why does any man ever go to Christ?
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.040]   Why does he ever apply to Christ?
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:39.320]   What reason has he for doing so except this one reason, that he has known this spirit
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.520]   of bondage, that he has known this fear, he has known this unhappiness?
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.360]   Why does any man go to Christ?
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.200]   Why does any man apply to Christ?"
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:57.160]   So the argument of Preston is that as the apostle puts it here in terms of "again,"
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:04.560]   he says you first receive that, and then you receive this spirit of adoption.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:11.320]   Well now, there is the case as put by John Preston, and I'm using it to support my
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.960]   own contention.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.680]   But now let us note certain points.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.760]   Here is the first.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:29.440]   The degree to which this spirit of bondage is experienced may vary considerably in intensity.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.320]   I'm not saying that everybody must have experienced this spirit of bondage and of
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.440]   fear with the same intensity.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.200]   What I'm saying is that they must have experienced it in some measure.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.480]   Certainly the record of the saints makes it quite clear that there has been considerable
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.400]   variation in the intensity of the feeling, and we must be very careful not to go wrong
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   at that point.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.320]   There are some, you know, who would standardize the experience of conversion, but they're
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.800]   not entitled to do so in terms of scripture.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:09.200]   There are some people who would say that unless a man has known a particularly deep agony
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.560]   of repentance that he's not a Christian.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.440]   But you're not entitled to say that from the scripture.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:22.320]   All the scripture says is that one knows something about this spirit of bondage and this spirit
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.640]   of fear which is produced by the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.560]   But then people very rightly put this question.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:35.520]   They say, "All right, I'm prepared to accept that in general, but what about the case of
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.760]   people who've been brought up in Christian homes?"
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:47.680]   Now they say, "Do you really postulate that they should know this spirit of bondage and
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.720]   this spirit of fear?"
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:55.320]   They say, "We can well understand how a man who may have been brought up in a pagan atmosphere,
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.240]   or may have lived a very dissolute and a very evil life, and suddenly confronts the truth,
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:05.640]   we can well understand how he may pass through a great period of crisis and of agony, may
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.640]   experience great bondage and condemnation.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.520]   But they say, "What about these people who've really always been brought up in a Christian
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:21.280]   atmosphere, have been taught the truth from their early childhood, and who have almost
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:28.800]   unconsciously believed in the Lord Jesus Christ because this truth concerning him has always
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.200]   been presented to them?
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.640]   They've never committed gross sins.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.960]   They've never been violent sinners.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.960]   Is it right," they ask, "therefore, is it reasonable to say that even they must have
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.600]   known this spirit of bondage and of fear?"
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:52.200]   Now I think that's a very good and a very important question.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:58.160]   And I would suggest that the following are the answers to that question.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.320]   It's a very common position.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.400]   There are large numbers of people who put up that kind of case.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.080]   They say, "I can't speak of any dramatic inversion.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.160]   I don't know when I was converted."
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.320]   All right, I would agree.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.600]   There's no difficulty about that.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.440]   There is no need for the conversion to have been sudden or dramatic.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:25.320]   But when they go on to say that for the same reason they have never known this spirit of
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.540]   bondage and of fear, well then I think I can convict them of error.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.360]   And I do so along the following lines.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:40.200]   First of all, it seems to me that they're guilty of false reasoning.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:46.800]   And their reasoning is false in this respect, that they are virtually putting a premium
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.440]   on sin.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:56.120]   They are more or less saying that what determines the presence or the absence of this spirit
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.320]   of bondage and of fear is the amount of sin in the life.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:07.160]   Now that to me is a very dangerous and a very grievous fallacy.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.360]   Now let me put it to you like this.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.760]   There is a well-known statement at the end of the seventh chapter of Luke's Gospel,
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.640]   which seems to me to deal with this matter very well.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.440]   And it's one which is often misinterpreted.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.280]   Let me read it to you.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.080]   Reading at Luke 7, beginning at verse 36.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:32.520]   And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.440]   And he went into the Pharisee's house and sat down to meet.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.880]   And behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.640]   meet in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, and stood at his
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.240]   feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:55.200]   the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.720]   Now when the Pharisee, which had bitten him, saw it, he speak within himself, saying, This
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.600]   man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what men are of woman this is that
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.360]   toucheth him, for she is a sinner.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.720]   And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.320]   And he saith, Master, say on.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.360]   There was a certain creditor which had two debtors, the one owed five hundred pence,
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.080]   and the other fifty.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.880]   And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.120]   Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:32.040]   Simon answered and said, I suppose that he to whom he forgave most.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.600]   And he said, Thou hast rightly judged.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.000]   And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.400]   I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet, but she hath washed
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.640]   my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:54.040]   Thou gavest me no kiss, but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.800]   my feet.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:02.560]   My head with oil thou didst not anoint, but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:10.160]   Therefore I say unto thee, Her sins which are many are forgiven, for she loved much.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:16.840]   But to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.360]   And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.500]   Now there is a statement which seems to me to throw great light on this matter.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.720]   And it's a parable, our Lord's parable is very often completely misinterpreted.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:36.400]   You remember our Lord says, Her sins which are many are forgiven, for she loved much.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:41.280]   But to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.680]   And their interpretation is this.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.640]   This was a very evil woman who had been living a very bad life.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.920]   Simon on the other hand was a Pharisee.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:56.640]   And therefore they say because she had sinned so much more, and had been forgiven so much
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.440]   more, she loved more.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.680]   But what a terrible thing to say.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.720]   The end of that argument is, well we'd all better sin as much as we can.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.440]   Because the more we sin, the more we shall be forgiven, and the more we are forgiven,
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.240]   the more we shall love.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.440]   Which is obviously impossible Christian teaching.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:20.160]   Now our Lord is not teaching that, but what he is teaching is this.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.900]   What matters is not the amount of sin that we have committed.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.120]   What matters is our realization of our sinfulness.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.160]   What he says is this.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:37.240]   It is the one who realizes the extent of sin, and therefore the extent of forgiveness, is
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.600]   the one who loves much.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.560]   He cannot mean anything else.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:48.400]   Because if you put any other interpretation, it is as I say to put a premium on sin.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.640]   And our Lord obviously could never teach any such terrible doctrine.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.200]   Oh no.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.160]   It is the realization of sin that matters.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.640]   And this is something that is thus possible to somebody who has been brought up in a Christian
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:07.040]   home as it is to one who has been born in a pagan atmosphere.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.440]   Now this is a tremendously important point.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:18.480]   I may have quoted to you before the case of a person known to me, who once said a thing
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.780]   like this.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:25.680]   She had observed that certain characters in a church who had once been violent drunkards
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:31.400]   and so on, that they seemed to have some remarkable joy.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.320]   They could look at a dramatic conversion, a great change in their lives.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:42.400]   And this good lady said that she almost wished at times that she had been a terrible drunkard,
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.160]   in order that she might have this wonderful experience.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.580]   Well now you see how wrong that is.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.680]   That is an incitement to sin.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.920]   That is to say, let us continue in sin that grace may abound.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:59.960]   But we have already seen in chapter 6 that that is entirely false teaching.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.080]   And the very opposite of what the apostle would have us believe.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.020]   Well very well then, there is my first answer.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.800]   But I have a second answer.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:14.600]   Now here is a point which I want to handle very carefully, because I don't want to discourage
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.260]   anybody.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:22.600]   But on the other hand it is our business to apply the truth and to be honest with it.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:33.240]   There is my friend such a thing as mere believism, or what the fathers used to call fideism.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.240]   What do I mean by that?
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.600]   Well I mean this.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:42.880]   It is simply saying that you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that he
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.480]   died for your sin.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:50.200]   Now this is the particular danger of course for all who have been brought up in Christian
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.280]   homes and in a Christian atmosphere.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.880]   They hear this teaching, there may be a call in a meeting for those who are prepared to
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.440]   say that they believe to come forward and say so.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.440]   And they do so.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.360]   There may be an emotional element present in the meeting.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.960]   The whole atmosphere may be somewhat emotional and electric.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:14.360]   And so they say that they believe now that they are sinners and that they believe that
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.200]   Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that he has died for their sins.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.280]   And they are told therefore that they are Christians, that they are children of God.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.840]   Well now they may be, but they may not be.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.280]   It may be something purely intellectual.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:36.240]   If this happens without any conviction of sin, or without any true understanding of
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:44.240]   salvation, well then I would urge you to believe that it is something which is extremely doubtful.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.720]   There are others who have said that they believe because they have suddenly had a fright of
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.720]   hell.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.280]   They have had nothing but that.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.040]   They don't want to go to hell.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.520]   And they do want to go to heaven.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.600]   So they say they believe and they are assured that all is well.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.780]   I think you must agree that that again comes very far short of what the Bible means by
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.240]   conviction of sin.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:12.200]   It doesn't conform at any rate to what we saw last Friday as the characteristics of
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.080]   the spirit of bondage again to fear.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:22.240]   Now then there is this very real danger therefore, that many who are assumed to be Christians
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:29.400]   and who assume themselves that they are Christians, are really not Christians at all.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.320]   And it is very important that we should realize that.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:37.640]   That is why the apostle tells the Corinthians and others to examine themselves, to prove
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:42.040]   their own selves, to make sure that they are in the faith.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.360]   We are exhorted to do that by the New Testament.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.440]   And if we cannot stand the testing and the examination of the New Testament, well then
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.480]   I say there is something seriously wrong with us.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:59.800]   I remember once being in a conference, I am saying this to illustrate the point, and I
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:05.600]   had been asked to give some addresses on the Holy Spirit, his person and his work.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:14.160]   And as I came to do so, I was informed that certain people present at this conference
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.560]   on one of the evenings had been somewhat alarmed.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.640]   Some of them had been beginning to feel that they were not Christians at all.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.440]   This was a student conference, and the authorities responsible for this conference, at least
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.000]   some of them, came to me with great concern.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.040]   They felt this was terrible, that these young Christians were being upset and disturbed.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:42.360]   Some of them felt that they were not Christians at all, and that they had been mistaken, and
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.520]   that they had only thought that they were Christians.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.880]   They were made most unhappy.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.520]   What an extraordinary situation.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.000]   My reply to this, of course, was simply this.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.920]   I said, "If these people's Christianity cannot even stand up to the test of an exposition
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:06.640]   of the biblical teaching concerning the work and the person of the Holy Spirit, well, what
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.640]   hope do they have at the day of judgment when the secret of all hearts shall be disclosed?"
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.880]   No, no.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:19.560]   If the faith we think we have cannot stand up to the test of exposition of Scripture,
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.880]   what kind of faith is it?
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:27.160]   Are people who say that they believe to be put into a glass house and to be protected,
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.560]   must they never be made to feel unhappy?
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.120]   You see, that is the position which we get into at times when we are not scriptural.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.000]   We are so anxious to have converts that they must never be disturbed.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.640]   On the other hand, it seems to me we should thank God for every time that we are disturbed.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.240]   We should thank God when we are ever forced to examine ourselves to make sure whether
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.120]   we are in the faith or not.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:23:00.080]   And if our faith cannot stand up to the test of Scripture such as this, what kind of faith
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.920]   is it in reality?
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:07.440]   There is the grave danger that it is nothing but this kind of easy believism, which is
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.480]   rarely not the work of the Holy Spirit at all.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.920]   But then let me go on to a third answer.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:22.640]   The Holy Spirit, being the Spirit of truth and the Spirit of holiness, always produces
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:28.040]   a sense of sin and a sense of conviction.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.760]   He has been sent into the world to do that.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:40.720]   He shall convince, convict the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.600]   And the Holy Spirit, when he works, must do that.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.480]   He has been sent to do it.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.760]   What the Holy Spirit does, in other words, is to reveal God to us.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.760]   He reveals the character of God, the holiness of God.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:24:00.320]   He reveals at the same time, of course, the law in all its spirituality, and thereby he
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.960]   reveals us to ourselves.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:08.700]   So you see, when the Holy Spirit does his work, it is inevitable that it should come
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.440]   to this in some degree or other.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.760]   It should make us say, "Just and holy is thy name.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.800]   I am all unrighteousness.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.760]   Vile and full of sin I am.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:28.440]   Thou art full of truth and grace."
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.800]   The thing, I say, is quite inevitable.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.640]   The Holy Spirit always does that work.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.160]   He reveals the Lord Jesus Christ to us as what?
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.160]   As Son of God, as Savior.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.840]   But why do we need a Savior?
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.400]   We need a Savior because of the holiness of God, and the holiness of the law, and our
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.720]   own sinfulness and imperfection.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.160]   The Holy Spirit, in convicting us of necessity, does that.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:59.400]   And as he does that, he produces this spirit of bondage, and this spirit of fear.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:09.680]   Now my argument is, you see, this, that the Holy Spirit cannot lead us to God in any sense
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:16.440]   without giving us some impression, some notion, some idea of the holiness of God, and the
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:22.640]   glory of God, and the majesty, and the righteousness, and the justice of God.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:30.080]   And it is that that invariably produces this sense of bondage and of fear.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.240]   But let me add another argument to that to substantiate that.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:42.420]   It is because of what I've just been saying in the fourth place, that you find that the
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:53.960]   experience of all the saints, always, is this, that the more the Holy Spirit works in them,
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:26:00.080]   the greater is their understanding of the being of God, and their own sinfulness, and
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.680]   their own unworthiness.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:07.200]   All the saints have testified to this, that as they've grown in grace and in the knowledge
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:13.600]   of the Lord, they have seen the depths of sin within themselves in a manner that they'd
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.640]   never imagined before.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:21.680]   The more they go on, the more they're aware of their utter dependence upon the Lord Jesus
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.680]   Christ.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.920]   Now, there is surely no need to prove this.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:33.600]   God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.400]   God is sure, absolute holiness.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.720]   What does Christianity do?
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.900]   It brings us into a knowledge of God.
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.120]   It brings us into communion with God.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:50.280]   Therefore, the nearer you get to God, the more you see his holiness, the more you see
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:55.640]   your own imperfection, your own unworthiness, and your own sinfulness.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.440]   There is no need to argue about the thing.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.560]   It follows as the night, the day.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:05.560]   And any deep knowledge of God is a deep knowledge of holiness.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:11.400]   It is an equally deep knowledge of sin within, and everything that is unworthy, and everything
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.080]   that is unlike God.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:22.440]   So as the saint grows, he has an increasing awareness of his own sinfulness and unworthiness.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.240]   Let me add another proof to that, my fifth proof.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:33.040]   Here I turn to the evidence and the testimony provided by the great revivals of religion.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.520]   And this is what they tell us.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.880]   It is a common experience, this.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.800]   It is almost universal.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.960]   Here are people who have been members of the Christian Church perhaps for fifty years.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.200]   There is no doubt about their believing in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.280]   They have realized their sinfulness.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.920]   They have had conviction of sin.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.200]   And they have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.240]   Suddenly this revival comes.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.160]   The Spirit suddenly is outpoured upon them.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.560]   What do they testify?
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:14.280]   Their testimony is this, that their first experience is one of terrible and of awful
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.700]   sinfulness.
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.920]   They can scarcely believe it.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.280]   They are horrified at the sight.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.640]   For a while they begin to wonder whether they have ever been Christians at all.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.560]   They never realized the depth of sin within them.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.560]   Now I am simply quoting testimonies to you.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.920]   This happens in every revival.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.080]   And then of course they come to see more clearly than they have ever seen before, on the other
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.920]   hand, the perfect work of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.040]   And how though they now see their sinfulness to be much deeper and greater than they had
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.720]   ever imagined, they see that the blood of Christ is also much greater than they had
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.280]   ever realized before.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.680]   But my argument is this.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:03.120]   There in revival, you see the Holy Spirit is doing his work in unusual power.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.200]   And whenever he does it, that is what happens.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:13.500]   The glory of God, the holiness of God, the place seems to be filled with the presence
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.680]   of God and they immediately feel their own unworthiness.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.960]   Now that is of course just on a huge scale what we find in many individual experiences
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.960]   in the Bible.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.280]   Take the case of Isaiah, as he describes it in chapter 6.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:33.440]   Here was a man, you see, a man of God, a man who was called by God and trained by God.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.880]   But suddenly he is commissioned for his work as a prophet.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.320]   And you remember what he tells us.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.960]   He is given that vision of the glory of God.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.840]   And what happens?
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.800]   Immediately he feels this sense of his own unworthiness.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:55.160]   "Woe is me," he says, "I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell among a people of
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.960]   unclean lips."
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.200]   What made him feel that?
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.880]   Was it that he suddenly committed some special sins?
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.880]   Not at all.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.920]   The thing that gives us conviction of sin is not the number of sins we have committed,
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.740]   it is the sight of the holiness of God.
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:14.980]   It is light that reveals darkness.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.560]   You don't do it by counting the darkness, as it were.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.520]   It's the contrast of the light.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.980]   It is the purity that reveals the impurity.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:28.300]   So this whole argument is based on a complete and an entire fallacy.
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.720]   And it is something of which we must be very wary, therefore.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:37.700]   So I would add as my sixth and my final argument this.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:45.060]   I have generally discovered that the people who say that they have never known this spirit
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:54.320]   of bondage and of fear are also people who have to say, honestly, that they have also
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:00.140]   not known really the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.140]   It's very interesting.
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:05.280]   They say, "I've never known that spirit of bondage and of fear," and they've always
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.420]   explained it away by saying, "Well, of course, I was brought up in a Christian home.
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.100]   There was never a time when I didn't know these things.
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.020]   I took to them without knowing it.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.020]   It was inevitable."
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:20.900]   Yes, but you see, they don't know either the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba,
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:21.900]   Father."
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.780]   They're often doubtful about themselves.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:27.220]   They haven't got a great assurance of salvation.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.160]   It looks as if the two things go together, doesn't it?
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.040]   And they do go together.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.100]   Because they haven't the one, they haven't the other either.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:40.460]   Therefore this is a most important statement, this negative statement.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:49.020]   The Holy Spirit being the spirit of truth, the spirit of holiness, must of necessity
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:56.060]   produce this sense of condemnation, this sense of sinfulness, this sense of bondage, of inability,
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:01.420]   of helplessness, of the power of sin, this terrible power of sin that finally makes a
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:04.300]   man cry out, "Oh, wretched men that I am!
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.700]   Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:13.380]   Very well then, there are my answers to this question about the case of those who've
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.980]   always been brought up in a Christian atmosphere.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:21.100]   But let me again emphasize these important additional points.
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:28.500]   One, I am not stressing the degree of intensity of this feeling.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.060]   I do want to make that perfectly clear.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.660]   Let me again put it like this.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:40.820]   I've often quoted the case of John Bunyan, who for 18 months passed through this terrible
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.700]   agony of this spirit of bondage and of fear.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.660]   18 months of it.
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.900]   He almost felt like doing away with himself.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.780]   Now there are people who foolishly say, "If a man hasn't felt that, he's never been
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.780]   convicted of sin.
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.660]   He's never had this spirit of bondage."
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.500]   That is sheer nonsense, of course.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.220]   That's to emphasize the degree or the intensity.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.060]   I'm not doing that.
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:07.400]   All I'm saying is this, that you must have known something about it.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.660]   It can be strong, it can be weak, as the spirit of adoption can be strong or weak.
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.500]   There are all sorts of variations.
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:19.020]   There are degrees in intensity of natural human love.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:26.020]   I'm simply saying that at some point or another, in some degree or another, there
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:33.380]   must have been this spirit of bondage, this awareness that we are sinful and unworthy
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:41.740]   and helpless, and that we cannot save ourselves, that we need to be delivered.
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:46.260]   In other words, you see, it is the difference between just hearing somebody presenting the
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:51.300]   Lord Jesus Christ as Savior, and just as you are, without feeling anything, say, "Well,
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.300]   I believe that.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.540]   I say that I believe that."
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:57.340]   And then being told, "All right, you're a Christian, all is well," I say that that
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.740]   isn't true conversion.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:08.340]   That in true conversion, there is always some degree of realization of the horror of sin
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:15.740]   within, and of the fact that we are bond slaves to sin, and the desire, I say, to be delivered
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.220]   from it.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.500]   Very well.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:26.060]   My second comment would be this, and I say this for your comfort.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:35.020]   I would argue that a concern about the lack of assurance, or a concern about a lack of
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:42.660]   love to God, is in itself an expression of the spirit of bondage and of fear.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.740]   I'm not only saying it for your comfort.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:50.180]   I am compelled to say it by the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:58.780]   The unregenerate man is never concerned and worried about his lack of love for God.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.780]   Never.
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.140]   That's impossible.
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.140]   Why is it impossible?
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.540]   It's impossible because of what the apostle has already told us in the seventh verse of
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.900]   this eighth chapter.
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:15.060]   The carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.060]   indeed can be.
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:21.740]   So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:28.060]   The natural man, the unregenerate man, is never concerned about his lack of love to
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.060]   God.
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.060]   Never.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:34.640]   Neither is he ever concerned about a lack of assurance of salvation.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:39.540]   He cannot be, because the natural mind receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:44.220]   are foolishness unto him, neither can he, for they are spiritually deserved.
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:50.220]   Very well then, I say, that if you really have got a concern about your lack of assurance,
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:56.100]   or your lack of love for God, or the Lord Jesus Christ, I would suggest to you that
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.240]   it is a part of the spirit of bondage.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:03.060]   It is a part of this spirit of fear.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:08.120]   And again, that also can vary in degree and in intensity.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:15.540]   And so my third and last remark at this point is this, that surely, therefore, nothing is
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:23.420]   more important for us than to examine ourselves in the light of this statement.
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:31.860]   Have I ever known in any degree this spirit of bondage to fear?
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.460]   You can test it very well.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.140]   You can test yourselves at this moment.
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:41.300]   If you have really got this, and I don't care how small it is, it will be one of the
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:44.700]   chief things in your life, if not the chiefest thing.
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.500]   It won't leave you alone.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:52.660]   If you haven't got assurance of salvation, well, you'll be so unhappy that you'll
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.540]   be doing something about it.
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.900]   You won't be able to just allow it to go away.
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.460]   You won't give yourself rest nor peace until you've got it.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.740]   You will say to God, "Search me and try me.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:09.500]   Reveal unto me my state, my condition."
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:14.600]   You will ask God to deal with you in such a way that anything and everything that is
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.720]   standing between you and this may be removed.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:23.220]   That is, therefore, proof positive that the Holy Spirit is dealing with you.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:30.540]   In other words, if we examine ourselves and prove ourselves and test ourselves and give
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:36.900]   ourselves no rest nor peace until we can say quite definitely, "Yes, I have known
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.700]   the spirit of adoption."
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:45.740]   And further, "I know the spirit," I should have said first, "I have known the
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.860]   spirit of bondage and of fear."
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:55.540]   Yes, more, "I now know something about the spirit of adoption also whereby I cry,
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.660]   'Abba, Father.'"
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:01.740]   You say, "Well, I've spent all this time on this negative."
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:07.460]   Because as I'm trying to show you, it is to me one of the most valuable proofs of our
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.460]   sonship.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:15.660]   A man who has known the spirit of bondage and of fear can be quite certain that he is
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.500]   a son of God.
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:26.300]   If you have not known it in some degree, well then it is my duty to tell you that you'd
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:34.300]   better examine yourselves, that you'd better prove your own selves to see whether ye be
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.020]   in the faith or not.
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:41.580]   As the apostle puts it in the last chapter of his second epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:49.500]   I'm quoting him, "Prove your own selves, examine yourselves, whether ye be in the
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.380]   faith or not."
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:58.700]   The absence of this spirit of bondage should certainly drive us to do that immediately.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:06.780]   Now, this isn't to say that we are to seek to be unhappy or seek to be miserable or anything
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.020]   of the kind.
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:15.780]   It is just to face this obvious position that the Holy Spirit, being what he is and being
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:26.300]   sent to do what he has been sent to do, invariably as he reveals God and the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:32.300]   must produce in us this sense of unworthiness.
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:37.740]   And my dear friend, if you and I have not known this sense of unworthiness, if we haven't
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:45.760]   known some sense of desperation with ourselves and the sin that is within us, how can we
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.860]   claim to have a real knowledge of God?
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.940]   You see, there is all the difference in the world between recognizing that certain things
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.500]   are bad and are wrong and that we shouldn't do them.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.020]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:03.460]   I am talking about a sense of sin, a sense of sin within, a sense of the corruption of
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:07.340]   our nature, a sense of this utter holiness of God.
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:12.460]   Now, that's what the work of the Holy Spirit is, to bring us to that knowledge, both of
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.820]   us, both sides.
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:26.300]   And certainly, as we have that knowledge, we must of necessity be aware of this bondage,
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.820]   this helplessness, this hopelessness.
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.160]   We must fear about ourselves.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.440]   We will be concerned.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:39.360]   And as I say, we will give evidence of it by giving ourselves no rest nor peace, by
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:49.880]   giving God no rest nor peace, until the relationship between us is perfectly clear and we know
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.680]   exactly where we stand.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:41:00.640]   Well, my time is gone, but I do regard this negative as being of supreme importance.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:05.400]   The Spirit produces the spirit of bondage and of fear.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.320]   It is his work.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.320]   He does it.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.320]   He always does it.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.360]   We must do it.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:18.760]   How then can we be happy about ourselves, if we've got to say quite honestly that
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.800]   we have never known anything at all about this spirit?
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.280]   The fact that you've been brought up in a Christian home doesn't make the slightest
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.200]   difference.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:32.680]   Whatever your upbringing, whatever you've been, whatever you've done, believe me that
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:40.840]   with Isaiah, whenever we get anywhere near to God, our first instinct will be to go and
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.840]   hide ourselves.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.200]   You read of the men who've had visions in the Scriptures.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.880]   Look at John in the book of Revelation.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.320]   He said when he had this glimpse, he fell down as one dead.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.240]   Of course he did.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:02.600]   We've no conception of God in his glory, his greatness, his majesty, his holiness.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.360]   Try and think of it.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:09.580]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:14.640]   My dear friend, what gives the spirit of bondage is not your upbringing, whether it's this
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.640]   or that.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.240]   It's not the number of sins you've committed.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.660]   It's not the sheltered life.
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.400]   It is your relationship to God.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.080]   It's your knowledge of God.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.400]   It's positive.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:32.440]   And so you see it comes to pass that those who are most aware of their sinfulness, those
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:39.680]   who are most aware of the love of God in forgiveness, are not of necessity the people who've been
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.280]   drunkards or murderers or adulterers or something like that.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:52.080]   They are the people who positively have the greatest knowledge of God.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:43:02.060]   What determines the sense of sin and the sense of forgiveness is our knowledge of God.
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.680]   You don't look at this negatively.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.680]   You look at this positively.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:11.640]   I trust therefore that I've been able to deal with this question that I'm sure is in the
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:18.920]   minds of many who having been brought up in the sheltered Christian home and atmosphere
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:26.760]   of the church have been tempted to query whether this applies to them or not because of their
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.760]   peculiar circumstances.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:33.220]   My dear friend, seek God.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:37.480]   Seek the knowledge of God.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:42.240]   And you won't ask that question again for you will know.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.000]   You will have felt it.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:51.480]   You will have known something of the depths of sin within yourself and you will have seen
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:44:00.840]   the absolute need of what has been done alone through God's dear Son and especially by his
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.480]   death upon the cross.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.480]   Amen.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:16.800]   O Lord, our God, we do indeed come into thy holy presence and confess our ignorance of
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.120]   thee.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:24.920]   We see, O Lord, that this is at the center and the root of so many of our problems and
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.360]   of our troubles.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:33.440]   O God, manifest thyself to us.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:39.120]   By thy blessed Spirit we humbly beseech thee.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:44.520]   Grant unto us this knowledge of thyself.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:54.000]   That is our supreme desire, O God, that we may know thee the only true God and Jesus
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.760]   Christ whom thou hast sent.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:06.440]   Lord, look down upon us and do thy known work within us all by thy blessed Spirit.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:11.880]   And unto thee and unto thee alone shall we give all the praise and all the honor and
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.080]   all the glory.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:22.120]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love of God, the fellowship
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:28.760]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:35.840]   the remainder of this hour's short uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.600]   Amen.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.520]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
