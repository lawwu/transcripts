[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Welcome back on this Monday, on the final day of July.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Last time on Thursday, we looked at God's joy and how His joy becomes our joy by the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   A really key episode, EPJ 1962.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   This week we continue on the joy theme, but we add another theme to it, the theme of doubt.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   In fact, can we struggle with doubt and experience joy in God?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   That's today, and next time we look at how to fight off the inner skeptic
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   when we have doubts about what we read about in the Bible.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   That's on Thursday.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   So today, can we struggle with doubt and delight in God at the same time?
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   That's Steve's question. He lives in Nashville.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Hello, Pastor John. My question for you is about how much joy I can hope to experience
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   in the Christian life as someone who struggles seasonally with doubt.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Sometimes I struggle with doubts about whether God exists, or whether God is good,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   based on all the evil that I see in the news, or I doubt whether God has a plan and purpose for my life.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   These doubts come and go. They're seasonal.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   None of them extinguish the smoldering flax that is my faith.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   The doubts do not stay long, and they do not overwhelm me.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   So my question for you is this.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Do I ever hope to have deepening joy in God in seasons when I also struggle with doubts like these?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Or is joy in God simply impossible when doubts are present?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I think the answer to that last question is no.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   It is not impossible to experience joy in God when doubts are present.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And I think the answer to the question just before it is yes.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   You can hope to have deepening joy in God in seasons when you are also struggling with doubts.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   So those are my two answers. Now let's try to think biblically about this.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   First, a definition.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Doubt comes in all sizes and shapes and durations and levels of seriousness.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   So I'm going to call doubt of a Christian variety,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   that is, doubts that real born-again Christians have from time to time.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I'm going to call those doubts thoughts that enter our minds from who knows where.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   It could be Satan's fiery darts, desires of the flesh, skeptical associate at work who mocks your religion,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   some new scientific argument, lack of sleep, dalliance with sin,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   all kinds of sources for how doubt rise or thoughts rise in our minds.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So thoughts that enter the mind that make us wonder whether something the Bible teaches is really true
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   or whether we ourselves are as real as we think we were.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Those are the two kinds of doubts that I think a Christian wrestles with.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Christian truth claims may not be true or we may not be true.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Now, for the Christian, these thoughts are not conclusions.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   These are intrusions.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   They break in like a thief.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   They start moving around the house of your mind and knocking things over and making threats.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   This really does happen to Jesus' followers.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   When Peter started to sink after walking a few steps on the water, Jesus said, "Why did you doubt?"
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   When Jesus appeared after the resurrection, it says, "They worshipped him, but some doubted."
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Jude 22 says, "Have mercy."
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   This is in the church. "Have mercy on those who doubt."
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   In other words, such doubting is not a sign of no faith.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It's a sign of embattled faith.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   When Paul says we should fight the good fight of faith, 1 Timothy 6:12,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   he included in his meaning, "When doubts intrude, fight them. Fight them with prayer."
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   "I believe, Lord. Help my unbelief." That's a prayer.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Or, "Fight them with the Word."
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   That doesn't just apply at the front end of the Christian life. That's every day.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   We fight doubt by the Word.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   "Fight it by obedience," John 7:17 says.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   "If anyone's will is to do my will, he'll know."
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   He'll know whether the teaching is of God.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Obedient people have fewer doubts than disobedient people.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And my answer to Steve's question is that during that battle,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   during that season of doubt, it is possible to experience,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   alongside the anxiety of doubt, deepening joy in God.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Now, why would I say that?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   First, because the anxieties of doubt are a kind of sorrow.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And Paul says in 2 Corinthians 6:10 that Christians can have experience of joy
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   at the same time as experiencing sorrow.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   "As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich;
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   as having nothing, yet possessing everything."
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   If sorrow and joy can mysteriously coexist in the same heart at the same time,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   and they can, then doubt and joy in God can coexist at the same time.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Picture doubt as the troubled waters on the surface of the sea
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   and picture the new creation reality of faith as the deep, still waters of the ocean dips beneath.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Second, I think in Paul's mind, perplexity is another way of talking about some kinds of doubt.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   And he says in 2 Corinthians 4:8, "We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed;
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   perplexed, but not driven to despair."
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   So what is perplexity?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Perplexity is a state of confusion or uncertainty.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Uncertainty.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And what is uncertainty but a kind of doubt?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And yet Paul admits to experiencing this kind of perplexity, doubt,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   but knowing full well he will not be destroyed by it.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Perplexed, but not driven to despair.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And that confidence beneath the perplexity can be experienced as a kind of deep joy in God's keeping.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Picture a child lost in the forest,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   but underneath that growing anxiety of the child and his growing doubts is the deep confidence,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   "Daddy will find me. He said he would. He will find me. He promised to keep me."
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Third, consider Romans 5, 3, and 4.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   "We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   and endurance produces approvedness, and approvedness produces hope."
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Now what that text teaches is that the reason we can rejoice in times of misery,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   suffering hurts, it's misery.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   The reason we can rejoice in times of misery is that we have learned that
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   enduring through the experiences of misery has the effect of giving us a sense of authenticity.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   We made it.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   We're real.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   We have been tested by fire and found to be approved,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   and that, he says, produces hope, and hope is why we can rejoice.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   That's the argument.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And I think the very same process of testing and enduring and hope and joy
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   can be experienced when the kind of suffering is not physical pain but psychological doubt.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   We rejoice in our seasons of doubt,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   knowing that the suffering of doubt produces endurance,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   and endurance produces approvedness,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   and approvedness produces hope, and that's the ground of our joy.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   And I would answer Steve's question, "That's the ground of deepening joy."
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   He asked, "Can I experience deepening joy in these seasons?"
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And my answer was, "Yes."
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   In fact, he said, "These kinds of doubts are recurrent, seasonal."
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   When that's true, every season of doubt with triumph on the other side
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   can bring a deepening sense that God is faithful.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   God will hold me fast.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I can, in a sense, laugh at these intrusions on my peace.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I can scorn the foam and the waves on the surface
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   because in the deep waters of my soul,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I enjoy paradoxical calm because of Christ's keeping promises.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   So, yes, Steve, you can hope to have deepening joy in God
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   in these recurring seasons of doubt.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Every season of doubt with triumph on the other side
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   can bring a deepening sense that God is faithful.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that hope-giving word.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   If you want to ask Pastor John, email your question to us at
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   As we close, I want to highlight one point from early in this episode
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   that you made, Pastor John.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   You mentioned that struggle with doubt, when thoughts enter our mind
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   that make us wonder whether something the Bible teaches is really true.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   That doubt, battling the inner agnostic in our Bible reading,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   that's up next.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   We'll see you on Thursday.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   [END]
