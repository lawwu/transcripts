[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   The doctrine of God's providence is the theme of Pastor John's new book, Providence.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.020]   To see and savor God's providence makes a very definite impact in our lives.
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.640]   We cannot live properly if we fail to understand how God governs over his creation and how
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.960]   he governs over our lives.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.960]   In the past two Wednesdays and in the several Wednesdays ahead, Pastor John is celebrating
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.400]   the real-life impact.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.560]   This doctrine makes on our lives.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.600]   There are a total of 10 implications.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.680]   Last time in episode 1574, we looked at how providence confronts our lethargic worship.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.060]   That was implication number one.
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.600]   Here now with implication number two is Pastor John.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.640]   My second answer to the question, what are the real-life effects of knowing and loving
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.440]   the all-pervading, all-embracing providence of God?
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.000]   My second answer is this.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.360]   Seeing and savoring, which is just another way of saying knowing and loving.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.600]   I love them both.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.920]   Seeing and savoring this providence makes us marvel at our own salvation and humbles
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.440]   us, yes, with trembling joy, humbles us because of our sin.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:39.120]   By his providence, from eternity to eternity, God chose us, his elect, he chose us from
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.500]   eternity.
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.480]   When he saw that we deserve nothing but condemnation, he predestined us to be his children and share
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:56.240]   the likeness of his son in spite of our unworthiness and treason and recalcitrance.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:05.760]   He purchased us at the cost of his son's life, his only son's infinitely valuable,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.400]   precious life.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.000]   He called us the way he called Lazarus, out of death.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.880]   He caused us to be born again, and he did all of that before we thought anything, felt
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:29.520]   anything, believed anything, did anything, indeed, before we could think anything, feel
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.080]   anything, believe anything, do anything.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:42.720]   This is why the apostle Paul said all of it was to the praise of the glory of his grace.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.960]   Ephesians 1.6.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:55.120]   And then he gave us freely the will to believe, the will to repent, and through that believing
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.880]   and repenting, he justified us, declaring us to be righteous, perfectly righteous in
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.960]   the presence of the all-holy God, forgiving all our sins and becoming 100% for us and
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:18.560]   not against us, 100% for us in every experience of our lives, no matter how painful or pleasurable.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.720]   And he gave us his Holy Spirit as a seal so that we would be infallibly kept for the day
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.640]   of redemption.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.480]   And he is working in us now what is pleasing in his sight.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:43.840]   And he will keep us, he will keep us from falling and bring us safely to glory.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.080]   He has taken away the sting of death, and he will bring us through it into the all-surpassing
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.000]   presence of Christ.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.560]   He will perfect our souls, raise us from the dead, give us new bodies like his glorious
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.680]   body, present us with a new world, new heavens and a new earth for our eternal habitation,
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.320]   where his glory will be the light and the Lamb will be the lamp.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:21.280]   It is a great tragedy that millions of Christians do not know that this is true about them,
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.440]   that all of it is owing to the all-pervading, all-embracing providence of God.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:37.320]   They have been taught a salvation with themselves as the decisive cause at the point of their
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.820]   believing, their conversion.
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.920]   This view of their own decisive power obscures the glory of what God has actually done for
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.920]   them.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.880]   It strips them of stunned thankfulness for the gift of faith.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.360]   It dulls the intensity of their amazement that they were raised from the dead.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.260]   It takes away the wonder of their perseverance.
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.640]   They think it's owing to their own steadfastness instead of the omnipotent moment-by-moment
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.320]   keeping of God.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.320]   When my mother was killed in a bus accident in Israel, my father almost died in the same
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.320]   accident.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.840]   He was home on the same plane with the body of my mother, and after nursing him to the
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:33.080]   point where his injuries could take it, he and I drove alone to the cemetery to pick
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.360]   out a grave marker.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:44.760]   We discussed what it would say, and both of us were very happy to settle on 1 Peter 1,
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.560]   verse 5, and on her gravestone or her grave marker—it's made out of brass—are the
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.680]   words "Kept by the power of God."
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:04.360]   I have stood over that grave many times in the last 46 years and praised God for his
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:15.120]   sovereign providential majesty in keeping her believing and in keeping me to this very
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.440]   moment a believer.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.320]   I mean, keeping me from making shipwreck of my faith.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.280]   He is the reason that hasn't happened.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:34.240]   It is a glorious thing to see that the sovereign God chose me, predestined me, purchased me,
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:41.400]   raised me from spiritual death and helplessness, gave me faith and adopted me, forgave me for
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.360]   all my sins, justified me, gave me his Holy Spirit.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:53.920]   And I say it is a glorious thing to see that it is God's invincible providence that he
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.360]   is keeping me.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.360]   The older I get, the more amazed it becomes.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:08.120]   I think that must have been what moved Jude, the second to the last book in the New Testament,
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:16.440]   to close his book with the greatest doxology in the Bible, and all of it is to celebrate
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:24.800]   the keeping power of God, that God keeps his own people from making shipwreck of their
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.360]   faith and being lost.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.200]   Perseverance, eternal security is not automatic.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.040]   It is the work of God's sovereign providence.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   Here's what he says.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.760]   "Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:51.200]   the presence of his glory with great joy, to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:08:01.040]   Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority before all time, now and forevermore.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.040]   Amen."
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:09.640]   That's just the greatest doxology in all the Bible, and all of it was drawn out of
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:15.280]   Jude's heart by "you keep us from stumbling."
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.360]   Oh that we could see and savor this providence.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:27.040]   Oh how we would exult in the freedom and the fullness and the sovereign effectiveness of
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.040]   our salvation.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:35.360]   If we see God's providence as it really is, we will be glad that it is all from God
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.880]   and through God and to God.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.080]   We will be made humble and happy and hopeful.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.320]   We will give all glory to God.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:52.400]   The lowliness we feel because of our unworthiness will be accompanied by and tempered by the
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:58.000]   wonder of God's merciful and infinitely loving providence.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.200]   I love the way Jonathan Edwards describes this experience.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.040]   This is what he says, and I have quoted it so many times.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:13.320]   "The desires of the saints, however earnest, are humble desires.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.280]   Their hope is a humble hope, and their joy, even when it is unspeakable and full of glory,
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:26.880]   is a humble, brokenhearted joy, and leaves the Christian more poor in spirit and more
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:35.760]   like a little child and more disposed to a universal lowliness of behavior."
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:45.080]   This lowliness goes hand in hand, or maybe I should say hand in glove, with an amazed,
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:53.280]   joyful marveling that we are saved and how God saved us, how he is saving us, how he
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:10:02.040]   will save us from eternity to eternity by his all-wise, merciful, all-embracing providence.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:10.560]   So the second effect of seeing and savoring the providence of God that I want you to enjoy
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.000]   is this.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:21.760]   It makes us marvel at our own salvation and humbles us with a kind of trembling joy because
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.760]   of our sin.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.760]   Amen.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.300]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.720]   This is a key implication for seeing and savoring the precious reality that God governs his
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.680]   creation by his providence, and he governs us by his providence as well.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.140]   This is the theme of Pastor John's new book by the simple title, "Providence."
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.140]   Check it out.
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.760]   Thank you for listening to the podcast.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.200]   On Friday, we return with another question from a listener.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:49.240]   Up next is a question from Elliot, who wants to know, "Am I too hard on myself?"
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.320]   Am I too hard on myself?
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.120]   And how would I know if I was too hard on myself?
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.120]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.800]   We'll see you on Friday for that question.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   Thanks for listening.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.040]   [END]
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.040]   1.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   Is there a time and place in your life when you feel that you have more of a right to
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.040]   be happy than you do in your current life?
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.040]   A. I don't think so.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.040]   I don't think there's a time and place in my life.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.040]   I don't think there's a time and place in my life where I feel that I have more of a
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.040]   right to be happy than I do in my current life.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.040]   I don't think there's a time and place in my life where I feel that I have more of a
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.040]   right to be happy than I do in my current life.
