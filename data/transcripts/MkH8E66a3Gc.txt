[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080]   Well, why would God design a baby to live for just two minutes?
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.280]   That's not a hypothetical question, even for some of you listening right now to the podcast.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.160]   And it was certainly no hypothetical question when it was asked in a 1994 article published
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.320]   in Christianity Today, written by a grieving dad named Marshall Shelley.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.280]   Marshall had lost two children to genetic defects.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.160]   He and his wife, Susan, lost a daughter just shy of her second birthday, and they lost
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.200]   a son who lived for just two minutes.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.460]   Their children passed away within three months of one another.
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.960]   Their son, born with the rare genetic disorder called trisomy 13, lived for only seconds,
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.480]   as was medically expected.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.920]   The doctor cut the cord and gently placed him on Susan's chest, Marshall recounted.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.960]   He was a healthy pink, and we saw his chest rise and fall, the breath of life.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.720]   Thank you, God.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.740]   And then almost immediately, he began to turn blue.
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.800]   We stroked his face and whispered words of welcome, of love, of farewell.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.640]   And all too soon, the doctor told us he was gone.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.200]   Dr. Marshall reflected on the experience and wrote this, "I was with my son his entire
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.880]   life, two minutes.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.920]   He entered the world of light and air at 8.20pm on November 22, 1991, and he departed," the
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.720]   doctor said, "at 8.22.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.400]   It seemed a very short time, too short.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.560]   My wife Susan and I never got to see him take his first steps.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.240]   We barely got to see him take his first breath.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.760]   I don't know if he would have enjoyed softball or software, dinosaurs or dragonflies.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.320]   We never got to wrestle, race, or read.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.520]   Would he have enjoyed those things like his older sisters do?
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.480]   What would have made him laugh, made him scared, made him angry?
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.160]   Those questions swarmed around my soul in the days following my son's arrival and hurried
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.760]   departure.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.600]   So many things I wondered.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.120]   But one question loomed larger than all the rest, haunting me for months.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.520]   Why would God create a child to live two minutes?
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.280]   This question is very pointed.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.480]   Following the season of pain after the loss of two children, Marshall Shelley attended
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.200]   his high school class reunion and he was asked to stand up and share what he had learned
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   about life.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.000]   The story got back to Pastor John, who recounted it in a 1995 seminar on God's providence.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.640]   Here he is.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.720]   He said that he was at this meeting and one of his classmates is Marshall Shelley.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.240]   Marshall Shelley is now one of the vice presidents for Christianity Today, an overseas leadership
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.400]   magazine and partnership magazine, and Christianity Today, and the new one that they're putting
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.080]   out now, Books and Culture, and his big wig down there.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.520]   And Marshall has suffered a lot.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:21.520]   He had a child born who was profoundly disabled and lived two years and died.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.480]   And then he had a child that lived two minutes and died.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.760]   Same as some of the people in this church.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.440]   And he was standing up.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.840]   They just asked him, "Stand up and tell us a word, Marshall."
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.160]   And they didn't know what they were going to get.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.640]   And Kerry said, "It was the most profound moment at a reunion you've ever been to."
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.120]   Noelle's told me some profound moments at reunions that she's had.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.560]   It's funny that these things that go on in people when they go to 20 and 25 and 30 year
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.360]   reunions and they're asked to just say something about life.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.240]   So different than when you were 18, you know?
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.000]   But what he said was, "Life is hard.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.360]   God is good."
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.360]   Life is hard.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.000]   God is good.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.480]   And then he told the story of this little two minute baby.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.600]   And I read the article about three years ago and it just came back like a thing.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.360]   I said, "I've got to get this article for some families in our church."
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.800]   Because I remember he was wrestling with, "Why would God design a baby to live for two
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   minutes?"
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   You see, Shelly, Marshall Shelly didn't even ask the question whether God did it.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.720]   Marshall is just so saturated with the sovereignty of God, he asked the next question.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.720]   "Why would God design a baby to live for two minutes?"
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.280]   And the answer he gave was, "He didn't."
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.000]   He designed him to live forever.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.680]   And two minutes is not that much different from 70 years when you consider forever.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.040]   Now think on that.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.160]   Just think on that.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.960]   We don't believe in eternity most of the time when we're murmuring about why we lose this
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.880]   or that.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.160]   Two seconds is not much different.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.640]   I mean, picture the width of this building as eternity.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:19.240]   This right here is 70 years and this is two seconds.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.600]   Just think on it.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.760]   God didn't create that baby to live for two seconds.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.840]   Well that's one answer and there are others.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.620]   There are others.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.880]   This life, folks, is not the main thing.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.460]   This is not the main thing.
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.640]   This is preparation, testing ground, laying up.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.640]   What did Jesus say?
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.120]   "Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven."
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.040]   He talked like you've got a few years to invest.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.360]   Invest right because then you spend.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.440]   And we've got a totally different mindset.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.000]   We've got 70 years to spend and then it's over.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.940]   We really need to listen to Marshall.
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.760]   We need to listen to people like that.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.760]   Well, let me pray.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:18.800]   Oh, Father in heaven, I know, I know that when I say this, there's some incredibly raw
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.480]   nerves that could hear it and feel it and it's very painful.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:32.000]   But Lord, I pray that in all tenderness and in all meekness and with all hugging and all
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.440]   caring, we might believe the biblical view of life.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:46.560]   I pray that those suffering most among us would become our best teachers as many of
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.800]   them have.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:56.400]   And I pray that you would sanctify to us our deepest distress and make us ask Marshall's
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:04.080]   question even if we can't answer it, rather than asking an atheistic question.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.780]   Help us to ask his question.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:12.000]   Why would God design my baby to live for two minutes?
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.480]   Why would God design my baby to live for two years?
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:23.040]   And then look for biblical answers and live with them in peace.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.600]   Oh, Lord God, we want to be a biblical people.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.040]   We'll be a loving people.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.640]   We'll be a strong people.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:38.360]   And we want to commend the supremacy of God in all things for the joy of everybody that
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.360]   we meet.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.680]   Help us up right now in Jesus name.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.680]   Amen.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.440]   That's a great answer to the question and very motivating for me to not waste my short
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.440]   life too.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.080]   The clip was taken from a seminar titled "The Providence of God."
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.080]   This was session three.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.800]   It was delivered on October 11th, 1995.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.320]   It's worth a listen and it's online right now at DesiringGod.org.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.400]   Marshall Shelley's article was published under the title "Two Minutes to Eternity in Christianity."
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.360]   Today is May 16, 1994 issue.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.120]   Thank you for listening to today's sermon clip.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.720]   If you have one of your own, send it to me.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.560]   Give me your name, your location, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.640]   in the audio and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.800]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email and send it to me at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   That's an email address, AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.600]   Well, in the past, we have talked about jealousy in dating relationships.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.880]   That was the main theme back in episode 1177.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.600]   But we've not really talked about codependency in dating.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.080]   It's a common dilemma for dating couples.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.400]   And the question is up next time when we return.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.240]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we're rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:48.760]   We'll see you then.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:58.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
