[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.560]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.360]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.600]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm so excited you're here today
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.440]   for an in-person conversation with my good friend
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.000]   and second time guest, Sahil Bloom.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.560]   He's one of my favorite writers,
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.360]   and the life lessons he shares online
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.520]   are some of the best I've come across,
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.140]   and his newsletter and Twitter are must follows.
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.440]   But today, I wanna focus on a specific topic
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.080]   he's written about more than just about anyone out there,
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.520]   and that's razors.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.280]   No, not razors for shaving,
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.360]   but these simple guiding principles or rules of thumb
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.160]   that can help make decision-making so much easier.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.160]   We're gonna talk about razors
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.280]   that'll help you make decisions
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.120]   with people and relationships,
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.820]   when you think about yourself,
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.880]   just general decision-making, whether it's work or home,
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.720]   and how you spend your time.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.460]   There's a lot of great advice in this episode,
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.200]   and ever since reading Sahil's first post on the topic,
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.880]   I found myself using these razors regularly,
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.700]   and I'm sure they will add a ton of value to your life.
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.280]   So without further ado, let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.240]   My fitness routine this year had a few rocky starts,
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.880]   but I am back into it now,
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.340]   and honestly, one of the things that helped me get back
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.560]   is that I just added some new workout gear,
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.840]   and if I'm gonna buy more,
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.240]   why not have the best performance apparel out there,
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.880]   which I think is Viore,
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.680]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.920]   for this episode.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.080]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.960]   Everything's designed to work out in,
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.240]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all,
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.840]   and it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.800]   you will wanna wear it all the time,
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.880]   but it's not just for men.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.120]   My wife is obsessed with Viore as much as I am.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.280]   While my personal favorite
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.680]   will probably always be the Sunday Performance Joggers,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.200]   I have at least three pairs.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.600]   I just got a few pairs of the Core Shorts
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.680]   and three or four Strato Tech Tees, and I'm loving them.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.320]   Honestly, I can't think of the last time I went on a run,
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.560]   bike ride, or walk in anything else.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.060]   Their products are so versatile,
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.320]   you can use them for just about any activity,
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.440]   whether it's running, training, or yoga,
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.080]   but they're also great for lounging,
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.320]   running around town,
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.600]   or they even have a few things
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.280]   you can wear for a night out.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.080]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.440]   and for All The Hacks listeners,
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.280]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,

[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.460]   Zahil, thanks for being here.
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.420]   - I'm so happy to be doing this in person.
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.500]   - I don't do a lot of these in person.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.100]   We're in New York City at Podstream,
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.100]   which I've never been to, but--
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.340]   - Right in the center of Times Square,
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.140]   but we are in a dark room between two ferns, as it were.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.980]   - Yeah, we are.
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.980]   So much of what you've written online
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.300]   for the past few years has had a big impact on me,
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.260]   and every time I come into a conversation,
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.400]   I'm like, "Oh, there's so much."
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.540]   But I got this advice from someone recently about travel.
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.220]   They said, "Whenever you go to travel,
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.360]   "pretend like you're going to that city
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.600]   "a million times for the rest of your life,
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.560]   "and just don't feel like this is your last trip."
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.520]   So I'm gonna treat this conversation
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.880]   like it's not our last conversation on the show,
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.780]   so I don't have to cover everything.
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.360]   So I thought back to one of the first content of yours
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.880]   that I'd read, and it was all about razors,
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.020]   which at the time, I was like,
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.400]   "I don't even know what that is."
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.520]   And I felt like that would be a great place
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.400]   to start for this conversation.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.640]   But like everyone else listening, I'm sure,
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.100]   people don't know what razors are.
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.240]   So can you talk a little bit about what they even are,
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.700]   and we can jump into why they're important?
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.600]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.040]   So it's not for shaving,
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.840]   would be the first thing I would start with, I suppose.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.160]   I mean, a philosophical razor, the term is from philosophy,
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.360]   and basically the idea is that it's a rule of thumb
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.440]   or some sort of decision-making heuristic
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.040]   that allows you to cut through available options
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.040]   and make a decision.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.400]   So the whole idea was like, in philosophy,
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.320]   you can take a razor and it allows you to strip away
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.780]   any of the unnecessary things
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.980]   in order to cut through the noise and just make a decision.
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.980]   So Occam's razor is the one that,
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.640]   if people know a single razor,
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.440]   Occam's razor is the thing they've heard of,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.560]   and that's like the whole idea
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.160]   that basically simple is beautiful.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160]   It's like if you have a whole bunch of hypotheses,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.240]   the one that requires the fewest assumptions
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.360]   is generally the one that is right
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.360]   if you're looking to decide which path
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.840]   you believe is the driver of some situation.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.760]   So I've written a bunch about razors,
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.040]   and basically like extending the concept
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.460]   into a whole bunch of different realms.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.120]   I think a lot about ways to simplify decision-making.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.560]   It's always been something that I've liked.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.720]   You're sort of similar to that,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.200]   like life hacks are all sort of razors
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.320]   in their own way, shape, or form,
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.400]   like ways to make a decision, cut through things,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.920]   that'll just simplify your life, hopefully,
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.200]   like tools in your toolkit.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.080]   So that's been the kind of genesis
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.400]   of me writing about them in the past.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.600]   - I think when it comes to my whole scope in life
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.120]   is like how do I optimize everything?
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.840]   I think one of the challenges you get into
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.680]   is there's just too much and you get overwhelmed.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.280]   So for me, I love this idea of razors, rules of thumb,
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.920]   to just make some of it a little easier.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.400]   - Yeah, although the risk is that you then
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.680]   have like a million razors,
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.200]   which would be the pushback against this,
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.780]   which is like, oh, I have a million razors,
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.240]   I can't remember a single one of them.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.280]   So the way I always think about these things
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.880]   is like tools in your toolkit.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.040]   You don't need to like know that you have
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.400]   all of those different wrenches
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.520]   or all those different things at every single point in time.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.640]   You just need to like have your toolkit
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.960]   and be able to open it up and think about,
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.480]   okay, what applies to a situation at any point in time?
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.080]   And I don't expect anyone listening to go home
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.280]   and be like, oh, I got 17 razors to use in my life.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.000]   I did try to bulk them into a couple categories
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.680]   'cause I thought that might be helpful for people to think,
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.200]   okay, I need to make a decision on this thing.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.920]   Is there something that might make this easier?
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.360]   So the first one I thought about was related to people,
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.840]   the optimist razor, which I consider myself an optimist,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.940]   so I like this one.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.260]   Let's start there and kind of go through a few people one
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.100]   and see where we get.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.320]   - So the optimist razor is basically the idea
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.000]   that you should always default
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.860]   to trying to spend time with optimists.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.520]   And if you have a choice between spending time
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.720]   with optimists and pessimists,
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.800]   you're always better off spending time with optimists.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.320]   I originally came up with this during the period of COVID
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.800]   when there was a whole ton of pessimism out there
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.000]   around like, oh, the markets are going to hell,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.040]   the economy's going to hell.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.600]   And then there was like little shades of optimism
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.280]   and like kind of mid-2020 about,
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.520]   okay, but a lot of these things are happening X, Y, and Z
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.480]   that might be positive actually for the future.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.040]   Like the Fed was printing trillions and trillions of dollars.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.720]   And what I found was my initial skew was to pessimism.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.160]   And I was like, oh, short the market,
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.120]   everything's going bad, everything's going bad.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.580]   And really regretted that after a few months
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.040]   when I realized that the optimists
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.600]   were actually the ones that were getting rich
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.680]   by betting on things going well in that time period.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.960]   And so I started just thinking about,
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.360]   well, there's this little heuristic
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.040]   that pessimists sound really smart,
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.120]   but optimists seem to be getting really rich.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.720]   And it all of a sudden cemented in my mind like,
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.040]   okay, there's something to this.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.080]   And really I want to be spending more time
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.920]   around optimists in general.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.440]   - But it's not just about investing and making money.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.640]   It can be just who you want to hang out with on the weekend.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.080]   - Totally, that's why it applies so broadly to life.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.960]   And when I took it beyond that, I just started thinking,
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.820]   like, who do you feel good when you're around?
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.280]   Just as a general rule of thumb,
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.640]   you're like, who do I get energy from?
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.100]   Who makes me happy and feel good to be around?
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.280]   And that tends to be optimists.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   Like again, pessimists, they sound smart
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.040]   and they have a lot of things and negativity, et cetera.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.560]   But being around people that are positive
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.920]   and optimistic about the future,
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.000]   about what it looks like in any arena,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.320]   just tends to feel better.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.520]   And what I find is that good things happen
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.200]   when you spend time with optimists.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.880]   They just have a better outlook on the future.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.560]   And if you believe that energy attracts energy,
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   optimists tend to attract good outcomes.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.440]   - What about finding people to work with
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.560]   more than just hanging out?
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.840]   - And it applies to another kind of area
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.080]   that I've thought about, which is originally
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.280]   from Nassim Taleb, the author of "Black Swan."
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.440]   I forget what book it's in.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.520]   It's either in "Skin in the Game" or "Antifragile,"
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.240]   where he talks about this whole thing of the surgeon
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.440]   and how you pick a surgeon.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.560]   And so he tells this story of you're choosing
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.520]   between two surgeons who are of equal merit.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.320]   Assume they both have the same track record
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.840]   of successful surgery, say.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.840]   And one of them looks like this beautiful,
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.560]   polished Harvard Medical School credentialed surgeon,
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.360]   like perfect, clean cut, everything's good.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.480]   And then the other one looks like a butcher.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.760]   He's got blood all over him.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.840]   He just doesn't look the part.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.120]   He's big hands, whatever, big beard, scraggly.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.560]   And his whole thing is that most people
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.160]   pick the nice, clean cut surgeon
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.000]   when what you should actually do
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.920]   is pick the one who doesn't look the part.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.800]   And his logic is that the one who doesn't look the part
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.120]   has had to overcome not looking the part
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.600]   in order to get to where they are.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.560]   And so if they have equal merit,
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.920]   that one is actually the better one
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.360]   because they've had to overcome not looking
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.200]   like they should all along the way
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.640]   in order to get to that level.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.760]   And I've always thought that was another interesting way
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.080]   of thinking about who to work with
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.960]   because we do have all of these little biases
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.520]   and prejudices that are in our head
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.080]   and people that have managed to overcome all of those
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.080]   all along the way to get to where they are
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.400]   tend to be great, great people to work with.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.400]   - I don't know if you've ever done
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.400]   unconscious bias training,
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.040]   but it just kind of opens your eyes up to,
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.920]   oh, okay, even someone who might not think you have bias,
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.120]   you have bias for sure.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.400]   - Yeah, I mean, the statistics on those things are insane.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.760]   Like you can go on Google and just look one up
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.160]   and do one of the tests quickly
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.560]   and you can get a score on it.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.880]   It's usually pretty shocking.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.040]   - What about smart friends?
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.320]   - Again, like with people,
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.280]   the smart friends one is basically
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.600]   that if you have enough smart friends
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.960]   talking about something, you should take it seriously.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.600]   And again, like a lot of these were for me
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.560]   derived from bad experiences,
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.080]   like where I didn't listen to this
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.320]   and then I came to regret it.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.720]   Again, going back to early COVID,
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.320]   like all of these smart friends of mine
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.680]   were talking about Bored Ape Yacht Club
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.640]   as like a silly example,
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.480]   which maybe now it's like not as much of a thing,
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.440]   but at the time it was like this NFT project.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.560]   I didn't understand what NFTs were,
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.680]   but I had all these friends that were talking about it.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.320]   And I was like, dude, that sounds stupid.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.160]   I'm just going to ignore this.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.160]   Like, that sounds super dumb.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.240]   But I had multiple friends saying it over and over again.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.840]   If I had listened to them and done something about it,
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.880]   12 months after that,
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.400]   I probably would have made like a million dollars
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.280]   off of just putting in a little bit of money
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.120]   into this thing.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.760]   And so I developed a rule basically
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.880]   that was if three friends that I consider intelligent
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.520]   tell me about the same thing,
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.560]   I'm going to put like a little bit of skin into the game
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.400]   no matter what.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.960]   Even if I'm not going to go deeper on it,
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   it just like gives me kind of a hedge
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.720]   against looking like an idiot later on
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.160]   like I did with that one.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.600]   But again, it's just another way of thinking about
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.960]   drafting off of the intelligence of your peer group.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.300]   Like if you have smart people that are talking about things
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.040]   and you're in the circles with intelligent people
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.800]   that have domain expertise that goes beyond yours,
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.860]   listening to them and taking it seriously
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.200]   when there's enough density in a single idea
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.500]   is usually a good bet.
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.400]   Presumably they have to be excited about it
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.360]   or just talking about it.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.880]   I think excited about it and domain experts.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.240]   You don't want to have your like coder and engineer friends
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.140]   maybe like weighing in on like culture and fashion
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.880]   and being like, oh, I'm going to listen to them.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.160]   You want it to be people like if they're in technology
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.800]   and they're weighing in on some new technology,
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.800]   like AI could be an example today.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.760]   If you have a certain domain within AI
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.240]   that a bunch of your smart friends
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.960]   are really interested and excited about,
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.080]   it's worth taking seriously.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.240]   It doesn't mean you have to invest in it or do something,
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.640]   but it's worth at least digging into it
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.800]   and trying to understand more
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.080]   'cause it might be like an asymmetric bet on the future.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.340]   - Right now I feel like this about AI,
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.080]   except I just don't know how to make that asymmetric bet
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.480]   or maybe it's not even asymmetric anymore
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.640]   because what is it like 100 million people
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.760]   are using ChatGPT at this point?
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.960]   - Is it really 100 million people?
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.160]   - Growth curve on ChatGPT, you can search it
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.240]   or I'll find the link and put in the show notes.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.360]   It's like Instagram grew to 100 million users this fast
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.040]   and all this and you see these curves like this
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.720]   and then ChatGPT is just like a straight line.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.560]   - Straight line up.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.840]   I think I've seen that.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.800]   I still just wonder with technology stuff like this,
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.680]   how much of it is that we're just in a bubble
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.520]   of sort of like semi-nerdy people on Twitter
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.320]   versus true mass proliferation of an idea.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.360]   I honestly just don't know.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.380]   I think ChatGPT has probably crossed the chasm,
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.520]   but I used to wonder that like with Web3 stuff,
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.480]   like if you go to like a normal person on the street,
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.640]   they're like, "What the hell's an NFT?"
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.600]   Right, and so like there clearly wasn't
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.720]   a mass proliferation of the idea.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.000]   The utility of ChatGPT makes me believe
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.520]   that it is actually mass proliferating.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.120]   - It's funny 'cause I had this experience this morning.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.360]   I flew to New York today and I'm waiting for my bag
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.480]   to go through the metal detector
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.160]   and I hear three TSA agents talking about AI.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.880]   And they're like, "Yo, I use this thing
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.960]   "and it creates song lyrics, it creates art."
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.480]   And I was like, "Okay."
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.280]   It's clearly crossed to the mainstream,
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.160]   but the use cases everyone's excited about
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.720]   are not necessarily use cases
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.320]   that I think will drive business.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.600]   The challenge I have is it's something
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.440]   that I feel really passionate about being big
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.760]   and have no clue how to bet on.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.800]   And there was a pretty good episode of the All In podcast
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.400]   where they were debating how to invest in this space.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.280]   And these are some of the smartest investors in the world.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.680]   And I can't remember which one said,
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.920]   "I still haven't invested."
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.880]   Because if you look at the early days
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.520]   of so many of these industries, even look at social,
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.440]   like the first few social networks actually didn't work out.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.960]   And so I'm frustrated 'cause I feel like
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.080]   there's a there there,
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.520]   but I don't actually know what to do about it.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.400]   - If you're gonna invest,
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.120]   you also have to separate it from hype cycle.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.960]   Like normally TSA agents talking about it,
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.360]   I would say is like really peak hype cycle of something.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.760]   And so hype cycle drives valuations.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.880]   And so like I have this fund
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.680]   where I invest in early stage companies.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.740]   And if you were to look at like the average deal
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.800]   that says they're an AI company right now,
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.520]   like the valuation at pre-seed or seed
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.240]   is like 25, $30 million,
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.800]   which is very, very hard to drive a return
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.800]   in the aggregate across an asset class.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.720]   And that's what I struggle with is like
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.460]   they're benefiting from hype cycle on their early valuation,
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.200]   which hurts investors on the margin.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.400]   And so it's tough.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.760]   It's tough to like discern, okay, what's there,
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.360]   what's actually just gonna get eaten
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.480]   by whatever big company decides to do this.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.320]   It's tricky.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.140]   And most of them, by the way,
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.080]   are just doing like an open AI API call.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.960]   They don't actually have anything internally
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.080]   or proprietary about it.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.080]   And it's like, okay,
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.800]   you're just linking to another person's platform.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.620]   - The number of companies that have pitched me a thing
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.520]   that's like, hey, we take a document
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.540]   and we give you answers on it.
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.800]   And I'm like, you're just monetizing this other API.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.240]   - With like your own UI/UX.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.240]   Although a lot of companies have been built
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.640]   in that general way in different areas
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.600]   where it's just like,
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.080]   oh, we link to whatever platform
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.680]   we're using their back end, so.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.400]   - I'm not saying that company can't make money.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.660]   I'm just skeptical in investing
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.000]   in anything at these valuations.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.820]   - Totally.
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.660]   - But to come back to Razors,
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.980]   what do you do when someone comes to you with a crazy idea?
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.880]   - Oh man.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.280]   So my favorite thing around crazy ideas is,
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.760]   I think it was Paul Graham, famous investor.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.020]   He didn't actually frame it as a Razor.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.000]   I turned it into a Razor,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.080]   but he wrote this piece on what to do
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.600]   if someone comes to you with a crazy idea.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.920]   And basically his thing boiled down to two questions
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.280]   to ask yourself, are they a domain expert?
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.560]   And do I know them to be a reasonable person?
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.260]   And if the answer to both of those things is yes,
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.360]   then you should probably take the idea seriously
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.720]   because it might be an asymmetric bet on the future.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.160]   And I thought that was such an elegant way
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.920]   to think about this because it's very easy
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.120]   to write off crazy ideas.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.180]   Like you hear something and you're like,
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.020]   you don't understand it.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.200]   So you're just like, that sounds ridiculous.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.320]   Like that seems ludicrous that that would ever happen
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.940]   or that the future would look like that.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.780]   But if you slow down
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.480]   and you ask yourself those two questions,
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.600]   you can actually like totally deconstruct the entire problem.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.240]   You're asking like, are they domain experts?
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.800]   So do they understand this thing
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.840]   that they're talking about?
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.080]   Like the area around this thing very, very well.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.000]   If the answer is yes, move on to the next question,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.360]   which is, are they a reasonable person
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.880]   or are they completely ridiculous?
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.240]   And if you know they're completely ridiculous,
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.700]   you're like, okay, maybe I'm gonna hesitate a little bit.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.540]   But if they're not,
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.320]   if you know that they're like a reasonable person
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.180]   and that they do reasonable things,
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.160]   now you start to take the whole thing seriously
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.640]   a little bit based on those two.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.240]   So I've always thought that that was like a really,
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.320]   really good way to cut through the noise on it.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.800]   - I find that my instinct is often to be like,
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.780]   that's not right.
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.620]   - Totally.
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.920]   - I think that's most of our common instinct
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.760]   when we hear anything.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.280]   - Especially 'cause I don't understand it.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.080]   Like I'm not technical enough to know
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.160]   on most of these things.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.440]   And so when someone says something
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.440]   that sounds crazy to me about the future,
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.600]   what the future is gonna look like,
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.840]   what people are gonna be doing,
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.800]   my default is like, that's stupid.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.160]   No, no way.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.200]   And generally on like five or 10 year time horizons,
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.320]   anything I thought was stupid,
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.740]   I've been completely wrong about.
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.020]   Like if there were enough people talking about it,
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.960]   like e-sports, like someone said this to me,
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.440]   I don't know, it's probably 2009.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.760]   Like when I got to college, someone was like,
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.520]   dude, e-sports is gonna be the next big thing.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.840]   People are gonna fill stadiums
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.120]   watching people play video games.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.160]   And I was like, you are an idiot.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.360]   I'm not listening to you anymore.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.240]   That was dumb.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.880]   And again, if I had bet on that in some way,
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.880]   that would have turned out pretty well for me at the time.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.540]   And so now my new default is like,
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.600]   I take anything any smart person says,
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.160]   at least remotely seriously.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.680]   One of my razors was around like listening.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.080]   And the whole idea was like,
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.680]   if someone says something
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.920]   that is very different from your beliefs,
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.720]   you should listen twice as much as you speak.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.160]   And that applies to this type of thing
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.560]   with like new investment ideas
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.960]   or like ideas on what the future of technology looks like,
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.560]   just as much as political debates
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.660]   or anything that you're trying
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.080]   to kind of educate yourself on.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.760]   Because generally our bias when we hear something
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.800]   that we don't agree with becomes,
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.440]   okay, I'm just gonna talk over them
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.640]   and I'm gonna tell them why they're wrong about this thing.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.080]   But if you flip the script on that
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.600]   and you say like, I'm actually just gonna listen
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.440]   to a whole bunch and at least hear them out,
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.960]   usually you end up learning something.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.080]   Even if you don't agree with them at the end, that's fine,
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.400]   but you end up learning something
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.160]   from how they're thinking about it.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.400]   - Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.240]   I get it.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.960]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.840]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.900]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.840]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.800]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.720]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.520]   take care of the supplies.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.320]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.160]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.580]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.560]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.040]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.120]   that you got through another week.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.200]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.760]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.520]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.600]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.280]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.840]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.820]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.840]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.680]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.760]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.400]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.880]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.520]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.800]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.820]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.060]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.320]   I wish I could say I'm eating
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.340]   a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.120]   but the reality is that I'm not.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.000]   So I love having an easy way
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.140]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.820]   which is why I kickstart every day
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.720]   with AG-1 from Athletic Greens,
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.400]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   for this episode.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.820]   AG-1 has been in my routine for the past six months
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.560]   because I think it's the best option
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.440]   for easy, optimal nutrition out there.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.160]   You take one scoop of AG-1,
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.880]   and you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.200]   minerals, whole food source superfoods,
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.160]   probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.620]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.780]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.840]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.340]   and energized for the day,
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.860]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.620]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar,
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.660]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.420]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.820]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.380]   a free one-year supply of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.860]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:14.740]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:19.380]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.020]   to take ownership over your health
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.540]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.620]   Well, also, I think one of your life hacks,
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.820]   so Zyla has this great PDF of 50 life hacks.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:33.060]   If I remember right, it's trying to be interested,
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.540]   not interesting.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.100]   Yeah, I mean, this is like a simple reframe,
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.500]   especially when you're young.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.840]   I definitely fell into this trap
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.380]   when I first started my career.
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.580]   My whole thing was like, okay,
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.780]   if I'm gonna go to an event and I'm gonna talk to people,
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.100]   I really wanna be interesting.
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.600]   I wanna talk about all the interesting things I'm doing
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.440]   or the interesting things.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.800]   The challenge is on the margin,
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.340]   most people are not that interesting at 22, at 25.
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.540]   Frankly, most people aren't interesting
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.780]   for the first 10 years of their career
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.980]   'cause you just haven't done enough.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.420]   There's not enough experiences in your life.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.860]   And so my whole reframe around it
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.100]   is focus on being interested rather than interesting.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.380]   And being interested means you're listening
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.500]   to people, it means you're asking follow-up questions,
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.500]   you're diving down the rabbit hole with them
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.700]   to learn more about why they think certain things
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.940]   or why they're interested in certain things.
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.260]   And when you do that, people want you around
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.980]   'cause interested people are really fun to be around
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.100]   'cause they're actually listening to you
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.820]   and they're actually asking follow-up questions.
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.300]   Most people at a cocktail event or at a party or whatever
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.620]   are just waiting for their turn to speak.
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.020]   You're talking to someone, having a conversation,
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.820]   and you see them sitting there and they're just like,
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.060]   mm, mm, mm, mm, and then as soon as you get done,
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.020]   you're like, ah, they jump in with their thing.
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.620]   And that's not a particularly fun conversation partner.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.860]   So I just think it's a great way to stand out
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.860]   in conversations and to actually learn things
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:46.780]   when you're in them.
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.780]   - And it doesn't even have to be
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.140]   if you don't have anything interesting.
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.820]   It could just be to build more relationships.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:51.900]   - Totally, I just think it's a good way
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.420]   to live life in general.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.420]   You end up learning so much interesting stuff
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.100]   by just being interested.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.860]   And paradoxically, being interested
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.740]   is how you become interesting
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.160]   because then you end up getting into those cool situations.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.860]   You end up learning interesting things.
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.020]   And that's what you end up going
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.260]   and capitalizing on, working on, et cetera.
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.420]   - And how do you start that conversation?
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.380]   I think there was another life hack
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.380]   about just how to start the conversation to build it.
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.620]   - I just found myself in a lot of meetings
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.580]   or situations where I was way over my skis
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.700]   early in my career.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.580]   I've always just been great about finding my way
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.940]   into weird situations that I don't belong in.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.180]   Even this last weekend,
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.820]   I was at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.860]   and I had a chance to talk to Bill Gates.
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.020]   In a situation like that, you're like,
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.860]   what am I possibly gonna have to offer
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.100]   or talk to Bill Gates about?
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.620]   I don't have anything possibly interesting
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:39.980]   that he would find interesting
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.740]   given who he has access to.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.780]   So what I've found is that the best way
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.260]   to get someone like that talking
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.320]   in what would otherwise be a weird, clumsy,
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.980]   awkward situation is to ask them
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.860]   what they are most excited about in their life right now.
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.620]   And that can be personal or professional.
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.300]   They can take it however they want it.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.460]   And normally, really successful people
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.620]   have something that they're fired up about
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.740]   at any point in time.
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.580]   And if you can get them talking about that,
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:03.740]   then it becomes really easy.
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.900]   The pressure's off you.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:05.740]   They're excited.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.540]   They're energetic about whatever it is
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.460]   that they're telling you about.
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.300]   And then you can just ask follow-up questions.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.820]   You can just dig deeper on stuff,
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.220]   again, to being interested.
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.420]   And that becomes a much, much easier conversation
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.700]   with anyone.
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.100]   - And so what was Bill Gates interested in?
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.020]   - What was Bill Gates excited about?
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.780]   I actually don't know that I'm allowed
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.460]   to talk about the thing that he was excited about
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.940]   in public 'cause it was in a private setting.
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.100]   So I actually don't wanna share it.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.060]   - Okay, but it was a fun conversation.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.660]   - I mean, short, fun conversation.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.620]   And you get someone that otherwise
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.520]   you would be like, "Hi," to, to talk for five minutes.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.580]   That's like an amazing experience and opportunity.
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.700]   It was generally around climate technology,
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.860]   something that he's working on.
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.420]   - It's funny, I talked to Catherine Minchu
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.820]   who runs this company called The Muse,
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.100]   based in New York, and her power move
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.540]   in situations like this also,
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.380]   when you're talking to someone
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.580]   that's more senior than you,
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.600]   chances are that person is like,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.700]   "When is this gonna end?"
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.180]   Like, yes, you can make them excited.
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.820]   She tries to be the one that always ends it first.
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.220]   She's like, "Oh, I'm gonna remember that person.
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.660]   "Like, I could talk to them again
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.660]   "because they didn't just sit here and dominate my time."
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.620]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.900]   - She brought up a time where she was at some conference
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.500]   and she was talking to Elon,
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.560]   and in the middle of it, she's like,
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.400]   "Hey, you know what?
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.060]   "I gotta go, but it was really great to talk to you,"
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:10.900]   and just walked away.
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:11.740]   - That is a power move.
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.540]   - And she said it's made people that otherwise
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.380]   would be like, "When is this person
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.780]   "gonna leave this conference?"
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.060]   It just made it so much better.
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.340]   - Yeah, and it makes it less awkward
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.660]   for them to have to end it, too,
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:21.820]   like when you just do it.
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.020]   I also find, by the way, that following up
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.260]   and sending someone a book
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.380]   is one of the best life hacks in the world
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.900]   because all of these hyper, hyper successful people
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.220]   get sent so many fancy bottles of wine,
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.780]   expensive champagnes, expensive bottles of alcohol,
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.740]   like super nice gifts
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.620]   that you couldn't possibly spend enough money
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.500]   to send them something that would stand out,
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.500]   but if you send someone a book that really mattered to you
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.980]   with a handwritten note on personalized stationery
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.500]   of why you think it'll resonate with them
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.940]   and something from the conversation that you enjoyed,
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.980]   you'll always stand out in their mind.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.300]   Forever, they'll remember that
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.500]   because no one really does that.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.040]   It's such an old-fashioned thing,
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.900]   so it's a great, great way to stand out with people.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.980]   - Is there a book you've gifted the most?
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.420]   - Yeah, "One Breath Becomes Air," by far.
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.740]   Like, probably 95% of the time,
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.060]   that's the book I share with people.
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.460]   If you've never read it, it's unbelievable.
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.980]   - I know, I haven't read it, I'm like, oh, man.
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:13.820]   - Oh, you haven't?
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.660]   - No. - Oh, my God.
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:15.820]   Yeah, well, it'll knock you out.
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.660]   I mean, if you read it,
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.620]   like I read it on a plane for the first time,
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.460]   and the last piece of it,
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:23.340]   I was like full-on crying on this flight,
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.780]   and the woman next to me had to ask if I was okay.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.820]   So don't read it in a situation
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.220]   where you're not comfortable crying.
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.060]   - Okay.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.900]   So to wrap up all of these kind of people-related razors,
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.660]   I wanna talk briefly about Hanlon's.
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.500]   - Hanlon's razor.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.540]   Never attribute to malice
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.220]   what could otherwise be attributed to stupidity,
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.860]   is the way that that is typically put.
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.100]   So basically, the idea is if someone does something,
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.140]   we have this tendency to say,
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.460]   wow, they're acting maliciously,
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.980]   they're acting negatively towards me
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.540]   or towards other people, whatever,
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.980]   and we should never do that
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.740]   if stupidity is a potential argument.
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.900]   So it's like the whole idea
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.140]   that we give people too much credit
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.660]   for being malicious actors,
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.300]   when in reality, they might just be ignorant or dumb
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.460]   or unintelligent, et cetera.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.300]   This is a great one for Twitter.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.140]   In general, it's like you read people
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.940]   sending mean comments or saying things,
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.060]   and you're like, oh, they're acting so maliciously,
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.100]   and they're acting in such a bad-faith way,
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.460]   when sometimes you can just chalk it up
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.780]   to them being ignorant or stupid.
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.140]   - Is this similar to assume best intent
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.580]   or in the ballpark?
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.740]   'Cause I feel like that's one I use a lot.
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.080]   - Yeah, I'd say it's similar.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.740]   Maybe, yeah, assume best intent
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.260]   is probably a nicer way of saying this.
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.460]   I just always found Hanlon's Razor to be really funny,
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.520]   'cause it's just like if you are finding
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.300]   that you're thinking someone is acting
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.660]   in some bad, nefarious, calculating way,
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.360]   sometimes it's just that they're just not intelligent.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.780]   - You've written multiple posts
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.980]   with lots of Razors in lots of forms.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.660]   I tried to pull some from the old posts,
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.980]   some from the new posts,
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:51.820]   and that was a lot of things
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.540]   related to interactions with people.
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.540]   And I'll link to those posts in the show notes.
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.640]   What I like is that in a lot of those posts,
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.620]   you say, "Hey, use this when you're deciding
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.460]   "who to hang out with.
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.540]   "Use this when."
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.900]   And so we can link there
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.020]   if you wanna recap from this conversation.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.080]   The other area that you alluded to at the beginning
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:07.940]   is making decisions,
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.880]   which I think is something that, when optimized,
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.180]   can really save you time,
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.840]   because I know myself and a lot of people listening
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.340]   spend a lot of time making decisions,
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.380]   trying to get to the optimal outcome.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:22.220]   So let's talk about a few of these decision-making ones.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.180]   Let's start with the arena.
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.160]   - The arena.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.100]   - This all comes from "The Man in the Arena,"
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.420]   Teddy Roosevelt's speech of it's the person in the arena
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.700]   that really counts.
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.300]   And my whole operating principle around this
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.540]   is that you should always try to put yourself in the arena.
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.420]   And that takes on different forms
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.940]   in different areas of life.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.220]   But basically, don't sit on the sidelines
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.620]   and sling rocks at people that are out there doing things.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.380]   And so if you have a choice of two paths
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.680]   of how to operate,
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.700]   you should put yourself in the vulnerable position
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.540]   in the arena,
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.220]   because that's where you end up having
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.700]   the high upside things happen.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.500]   That's where real growth occurs
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.240]   and where you end up having those wins, et cetera.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.380]   You can't really win long-term by sitting on the sidelines,
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.820]   especially not sitting on the sidelines
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.820]   throwing rocks at people that are out there.
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:09.860]   - And you said this is the one
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.540]   you feel the most strong about in one of these posts.
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.500]   Have you seen a lot of personal wins from playing this?
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.900]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that it's the most wins,
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.520]   but it's also the most emotionally draining
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.620]   and trying sometimes,
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.040]   because by putting yourself in the arena,
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.740]   you're exposing yourself to the whole lot of people out there
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.700]   that do just wanna sling rocks from the sidelines.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.540]   I mean, you've seen it, right?
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.100]   Like we're sitting here, you're producing this podcast,
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.660]   you've been creating this for a long time,
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.100]   you share everything publicly, it's out and about.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.680]   There are gonna be people that don't like it,
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.060]   that criticize it, et cetera.
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.140]   That's not fun.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.460]   You're like me, you're a very positive, optimistic person,
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.420]   you're happy, you generally are just a good, positive guy.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.260]   And when there's random people out there
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.500]   that are reading your stuff or engaging with your stuff
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.420]   and are like, I hate Chris, he's awful,
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.900]   what a bad person, et cetera,
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.120]   it's a weird feeling where someone doesn't know you
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.520]   and they're engaging that way.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.480]   But you've gotten so much upside
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.480]   from putting yourself in the arena
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.800]   and just consistently putting things out there.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.200]   So I think it's like,
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.680]   you have to be able to have thick skin and take it
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.360]   when you're gonna be putting yourself in the arena,
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.120]   but that's where the real wins actually end up happening.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.760]   So for me, with my platform,
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.040]   with anything I'm putting out there,
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.920]   you're constantly putting your neck on the line
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.320]   and exposing yourself to it.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.820]   And when you're sharing ideas publicly,
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.560]   that's like a very vulnerable state to put yourself in.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.320]   The same thing applies to working in a corporate job.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.440]   If you're gonna put your ideas on the line with your boss
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.800]   or with your team or however you're gonna do it,
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.440]   it's very easy to just sit back
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.520]   and let other people do that.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.320]   But that's not how you're gonna end up progressing
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.960]   and making it to the next level of whatever you wanna do.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.720]   - Any tips for how you take that negative feedback?
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.880]   I feel like I'm fortunate
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.320]   because I don't love that podcasts
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.640]   are such a one-way medium.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.440]   It's so much more effort to be like,
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.640]   oh, I was listening to something cool.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.480]   Now I'm gonna go find that person's contact,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.440]   send them a note.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.320]   So I tend to get pretty positive feedback
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.040]   because it's people that were pretty excited
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.640]   about what happened and send an email and I reply to them.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.040]   I know you reply to a lot of,
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.160]   if not all the emails you get.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.040]   But a friend of mine posted
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.080]   on like the close Instagram thing this morning.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.080]   She posted something online.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.200]   She's like, I'm just having a bad day.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.800]   And she posted a picture of Ben and Jerry's.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.640]   She's like, I'm having ice cream.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.600]   She posted photos on her close friends
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.680]   of all the DMs she got.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.520]   And people were like,
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.880]   I can't believe you would promote a brand like that.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.760]   Or like, can't you eat healthier ice cream?
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.280]   And I was just like,
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.320]   like the internet can be a mean place.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.880]   Especially social media,
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.040]   which I don't spend a lot of time on
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.760]   as much as I do recording.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.320]   But I know a lot of people have probably faced this,
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.960]   whether it's at work, throwing out a bad idea.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.840]   How do you take that?
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.440]   'Cause I'm sure you've gotten a lot of it.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.240]   - I think defaulting to empathy
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.840]   is the single healthiest and best way
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.080]   that I've found to combat negativity.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.040]   Basically, when someone says something super negative
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.840]   on the internet to someone that they don't know,
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.800]   it's pretty fair to assume that that person
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.000]   is not in a happy place in their life.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.160]   Have you seen Legally Blonde?
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.680]   This is going to be an embarrassing reference.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.840]   In the movie Legally Blonde,
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.840]   she's like, happy people just don't kill their husbands.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.680]   They just don't.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.200]   I think about that with happy people on the internet.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.800]   Like happy people just don't comment mean things
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.320]   to other people's posts on the internet.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.160]   They just don't.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.720]   Like, it's just not a thing that you would think to do.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.560]   Like, you're a happy guy.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.720]   I don't think you would think to go
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.200]   and like attack someone that you don't know on the internet.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.680]   It's just not a thing you would do.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.520]   And so I tend to think that when someone attacks you
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.000]   with negativity, there's usually something
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.600]   that's going on in their life that's tough.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.000]   And we don't know what that is.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.560]   And we're not behind that person's eyes.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.280]   And so I try to default to empathy
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.120]   when I read something like that.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.080]   I'm just like, oh, that person's having a tough day
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.520]   or the person is in a tough spot for whatever reason
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.200]   and not get all wound up about it.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.240]   I never engage or fight back on that kind of stuff.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.200]   'Cause again, it's like,
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.780]   I'm not going to convince them they're wrong.
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:38.600]   I'm not going to make their life better or change it.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.880]   And so there's no point.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.520]   - Back to some of the career stuff.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.840]   What about when you're faced with trying to decide
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.640]   between two paths you could take at work?
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.280]   - So this is one from Naval that I really like
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.760]   where he talks about making uphill decisions,
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.520]   I think is the way that he phrases it,
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.720]   which is basically when you choose between two paths,
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.960]   you should choose the path that is harder in the short-term
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.840]   because those tend to be the paths
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.480]   that work out better in the long-term.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:07.120]   So it's like the whole short phrase of hard choices now,
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.360]   easy choices later, easy choices now, hard choices later.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.360]   And I think it's an interesting,
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.320]   although nuanced one, to be totally honest,
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.000]   as I've thought more about this one over time,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.120]   because sometimes choosing the hard path
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.140]   means that you're not allowing yourself the time
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.600]   to think about whether there's an easier way to do it.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.880]   Like Tim Ferriss, who I know we both really like his work,
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.600]   talks about often, like, what if this were easy?
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.160]   What would this look like if this were easy?
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.080]   And I think it's a really important question
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.640]   to constantly ask yourself,
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.360]   like, is there actually an easy mode
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.840]   that I can play this game on that I'm just ignoring
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.580]   because I'm like taking pride in doing it the hard way?
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.260]   And as someone who's like sort of a recovering
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.460]   hustle culture bro from back in the day in finance,
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.900]   I often missed the easy mode way of playing the game
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.940]   because I was so prideful about playing the hard way.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.060]   And so I think this like uphill decision one
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.360]   is actually a nuanced one I need to think about more
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.500]   and that people should think about more
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.420]   of any time you're doing something
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.180]   and it feels hard and difficult,
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:06.880]   you should pause and ask yourself,
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.260]   is there actually an easy mode?
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.940]   Like, is there an easy way that I can do this
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.100]   that I'm just missing out on
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.700]   because I'm grinding away in the way that I am?
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.460]   - I sometimes think there's both easy
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:21.220]   and I sometimes think that gets caught up in like cheaper,
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.700]   especially in a world of trying to optimize your life
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:24.540]   and your money and you're like,
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.580]   oh, well, this is the cheapest way,
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.100]   so I should do it this way.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.420]   - Give me an example of that.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.940]   - I've just talked about this on another episode.
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.540]   I don't know if it will have aired at this point,
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.460]   but my wife and I are talking about our children
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.420]   and we have a daughter who's about to be three.
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.360]   You'll learn this in a couple of years.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.800]   And she had this stint where she would just get out of bed
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.760]   after going to bed and she'd say, run out the door,
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.520]   open the door and say, I have to go to the bathroom.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.360]   I need a stuffed animal.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.560]   Like she would just get out of bed constantly.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.240]   And my wife and I are like, okay, what do you do?
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.880]   You go on the internet and there's a bajillion people
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.600]   who have an opinion about what to do.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.160]   And it's hard to figure out what the right thing is.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.980]   So it's like, what's your manifesto?
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.600]   Like, who do I trust?
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.960]   When it came to a lot of early decision stuff,
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.240]   we just went to Emily Oster,
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.000]   who's written a few books about parenting.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.360]   And she's like, this is what you need to know
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.800]   about the expecting phase, the baby phase.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.640]   But I didn't have something from her for this.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.520]   And my wife was like, well, I really like the content
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.400]   that this company called Big Little Feelings puts out.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.680]   And I believe we use their course for potty training.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.680]   My wife's just like, I really like how they teach
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.620]   what they believe in.
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:22.760]   So she took their course.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.320]   It was 30 bucks or something.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.600]   She's like, we have this other course, it's $100.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.420]   And she was like, do you think it's worth spending $100
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.320]   to get a source I really trust database
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.760]   of like how to handle every toddler scenario?
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.400]   And I was like, well, what's the alternative?
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.120]   So what we did was we were like, well, one alternative.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.240]   So I just asked ChatGPT.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.800]   I was like, what should I do with that?
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.680]   Answer was like, okay, it was surprisingly good.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.120]   But it was like, do we wanna go do a bunch of research
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.600]   or just trust this thing?
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.640]   And so a part of my mind was spinning saying,
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.400]   well, I could go find the answer.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.320]   Like the answer exists on the internet, it's all this work.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.840]   And it's the cheaper one.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.960]   So I was both taking this uphill battle
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.000]   of like the hard work of me deciding
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.200]   what the right answer is, but also the cheaper answer.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.720]   But my wife asked me, and this time she was
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.040]   in this situation I usually am,
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.640]   which is like, she's saying I wanna do all the work.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.800]   And what I learned is it was really easy for me
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.120]   to make a different decision when it wasn't for me.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.440]   When I put a little bit of emotion in it,
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.720]   I was like, just buy the thing.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.560]   No problem.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.280]   It was an easy decision for me, but for her,
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.520]   it felt so hard 'cause she was like,
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.520]   well, I could do this research.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.340]   I could do it.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.880]   And maybe I'd learn more.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.640]   - So cheap is not always cheap.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.320]   Like the thing I've always found is that
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.040]   the thing I think is cheaper is generally more expensive.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.440]   And I find this with everything.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.420]   This is like me not being frugal too,
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.840]   but I've always been big on just like,
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.160]   my wife would ask, like we were getting our new house
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.720]   here in New York and she's like, what furniture?
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.600]   Like there's this furniture or there's a really nice,
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.440]   like this furniture.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.920]   And I was like, just get the nice one.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.520]   'Cause like, you're gonna have it.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.840]   And like getting the cheap furniture sounds good
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.360]   when you get it and it's like 50% cheaper,
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.920]   but when it breaks, like we got cheap outdoor furniture
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.220]   and really nice indoor furniture.
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.480]   Well, the outdoor furniture after one winter in New York
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.240]   now looks like crap and I'm gonna have to buy
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.240]   new outdoor furniture.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.000]   Now I'm gonna have to get the nice outdoor furniture
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.040]   so this doesn't happen again
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.200]   'cause I don't wanna replace it every year.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.960]   Would have been better off just getting the nice one
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.440]   and taking care of it and doing that.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.420]   And so I've generally found that the thing
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.240]   that is like the cheap way of doing it,
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.960]   like spending tons of time on chat,
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.400]   GPT researching all this stuff.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.040]   Well, now I have the headache of having to like
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.120]   synthesize all of this stuff that I've found
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.480]   and convince my wife 'cause it's like what I found
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.540]   and she didn't find it.
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.480]   I just would have been better off buying the course
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.720]   and spending whatever it costs
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.240]   because it would have saved me so much time
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.220]   and so much stress.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.200]   - So nothing makes me happier.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.700]   And you're an example of this,
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.600]   of finding someone who's done all the research
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.560]   to come up with a bunch of,
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.840]   I'm not gonna go research what my razors should be.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.360]   I'm just gonna take your list of razors
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.200]   and be like, I'm gonna use this.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.920]   - That's how I feel about hacks with you.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.760]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.280]   So that's my gift is optimizing life.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.800]   - There you go. - Yours is synthesizing.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.320]   - Synthesizing razors. - I guess it's kind of
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.160]   a similar thing.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.640]   You've got business advice, personal advice.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.120]   It's different advice, just maybe not as focused
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.800]   on deals and travel and optimization.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.640]   But when it comes to decisions,
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.380]   there was another one about rare opportunities.
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:58.360]   - This is an interesting one
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.520]   'cause I heard this for the first time
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.120]   from the founders, two of three partners
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.920]   at the first firm that I worked at.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.480]   And basically, they were two younger guys
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.140]   who spun out from their prior firm
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.920]   with one of the founders of that prior firm
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.880]   to start a new one.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.960]   And they were like 30 when they spun out
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.520]   and got to be co-founders of this new private equity fund.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.720]   And I asked them how they thought about that decision.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.040]   And the way that he said it was,
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.540]   there are certain opportunities in life
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:31.540]   that you get, on average, zero to one time in your life.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.900]   The average person gets zero to one.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.540]   And so if you're one of the lucky people
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.060]   that gets that one chance, that one opportunity
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.940]   for this really rare opportunity, you have to jump at it.
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.740]   And he was like, starting your own private equity fund
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.100]   is an opportunity that you get zero to one times
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:47.940]   in your life.
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:48.900]   And so the fact that he was getting it,
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.080]   he was like, I have to go do this.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.580]   Even though he was on the safe track,
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.540]   doing really well at his prior firm.
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.000]   And I remember registering that as very, very interesting.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.620]   And then when I was thinking about my own opportunity
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.420]   to go and kind of build this ecosystem
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.260]   and the thing that I was working on,
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.300]   it was a really key factor in me deciding
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.720]   to kind of go all in and do it.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.980]   Because I felt like, okay, I might get one chance
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:11.080]   to do this unique thing while I'm on a growth curve
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.460]   and things are going well,
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.420]   and there's all this stuff happening in the world.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.780]   Like, this might be my one chance
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.860]   to go do the interesting thing.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.820]   'Cause if I don't, then I'm gonna have like,
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.020]   all this gravity around what I've been doing,
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:22.860]   and it's gonna have built, and we're gonna have kids,
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.020]   and it's gonna be much more challenging.
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.840]   So here's my rare opportunity that has popped up,
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.560]   and I need to just jump at it.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.580]   And I think it is like a really good framework
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.800]   for thinking about those unique moments in life.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.100]   Just like being able to pause,
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.880]   recognize when you're having that unique chance,
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.880]   and to just sort of throw caution to the wind and jump at it.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.280]   - And I think not overthinking the reasons not to do it.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.800]   So I look back, I was in college,
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.640]   and I won't go into the whole life story,
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.880]   but I didn't know what I wanted to do.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.720]   I didn't even realize that you were supposed
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.000]   to plan your job so far in advance.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.560]   So I was like springing at the end,
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.640]   like I gotta go get a job, I gotta do this quickly.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.960]   And I got an opportunity to work
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.160]   at an investment bank in New York called Allen & Company.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.400]   Kind of like weird, small, boutique bank.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.240]   - I know it.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.280]   - But the only job they offered was an internship.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.620]   At the time, I was like one month
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.520]   into even knowing what investment bank was.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.640]   And I only went down that path
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.680]   'cause I asked my friends who were well more prepared,
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.580]   said, "What's the best job you can get out of college
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.420]   "in American investment banking?"
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.620]   I was like, "Well, I guess I should do that.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.080]   "I don't know what I wanna do."
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.560]   And they were like, "Allen & Company's,
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.160]   "it's not like one of the places you could just get a job."
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.200]   Kind of had this mystique and allure.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.560]   And I was like, "Do I take an internship?
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.320]   "Not a full-time job, just an internship
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.920]   "and see where it goes."
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.040]   But everyone was telling me like,
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.380]   "This is a rare opportunity.
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.780]   "You don't usually get an offer
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.080]   "from a company that's so secretive and cool."
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.520]   - Especially when you don't know what investment banking is.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.560]   - I mean, I had read my bulk guide.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.080]   I don't know if the bulk guide still exists,
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.560]   but back then it was like, there was this book.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.640]   It's like, read this and you understand the industry.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.100]   So I took that, that was one.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.200]   I feel like starting a podcast was one.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.260]   There've been a handful of times
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.120]   where I've quit a job to go do a thing
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.400]   or I don't know, we traveled around the world
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.120]   'cause we were like, "This is a window to do it."
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.800]   So I love that one.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.000]   How would that connect to minimizing regret
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.560]   on these rare opportunities?
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.240]   - Yeah, I mean, the regret minimization framework,
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.680]   I think the first time Bezos talked about this
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.840]   was in an interview with Walter Isaacson.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.640]   It might be like 1996, like way, way back interview.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.720]   Basically, we're like super nerdy Bezos,
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.640]   not jacked out of his mind Bezos that we have today.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.440]   Like really nerdy Bezos is talking about
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.000]   how he made the decision to leave D.E. Shaw.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.160]   This relates directly to the rare opportunity, by the way.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.920]   Leave D.E. Shaw, which is like this famous quant hedge fund
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.160]   where he was making tons of money
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.200]   and like on a very certain path
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.680]   to make tens of millions of dollars in his life.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.720]   Amazing, amazing outcome in career, top 0.01% life.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.020]   Leave that to go start a bookstore on the internet,
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.100]   which makes no sense.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.840]   Again, like crazy ideas going back
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.360]   to connected to other raisers.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.160]   And his whole thing was zoom forward to the future.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.960]   Think about like your 80 year old self,
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.400]   looking back on this decision,
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.040]   will you regret not doing it?
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.920]   And if the answer is yes, then you should do it.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.960]   And so that's what he did.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.800]   So he thought like,
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.840]   will I regret not taking this opportunity
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.020]   and going after this?
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.320]   And the answer was yes.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.160]   And so he left and started Amazon.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.360]   And now we all get packages in 24 hours
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.880]   from drones that are dropping them off.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.860]   I mean, I think it's like a brilliant general way
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.700]   of thinking about this.
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.800]   I've often thought about it in both directions.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.360]   You're like, okay, you know,
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.000]   what would your 80 year old self say about this decision?
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.740]   Also, what would your 10 year old self say
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:20.880]   about this decision?
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.320]   And the reason I think that one's good
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.800]   is because like your 80 year old self
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.520]   really cares about the compounding
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.000]   of the decisions you make today.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.120]   And like how any decision you're making today
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.600]   is going to compound into the future.
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.360]   But your 10 year old self also reminds you
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.040]   to like not take shit too seriously along the way.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.120]   You're probably like this too.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.160]   You're an optimizer, right?
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.540]   You're thinking through every decision.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.380]   You're really thoughtful.
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:43.160]   You're like constantly trying to get little bits of ROI
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.360]   out of everything you're doing.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.200]   That's great.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.240]   I think there's a lot of value that can be gleaned from that.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.080]   At the same time, sometimes you just need to like
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.640]   have some fun and not think about razors
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.360]   and not think about hacks and just like go have a beer
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.420]   and like sit on the couch and not take advantage
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.120]   of whatever time you're wasting by doing that.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.680]   And I think that that always helps.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.360]   I call it the young and old test.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.840]   It's like you think about the decision as a 10 year old
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.440]   and as an 80 year old and then sort of like
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.320]   meet in the middle.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.640]   You know, the Bezos thing, like it ties directly
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.880]   to the rare opportunity.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.880]   It's like you have this one potential opportunity
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.520]   in your whole life to go do this thing
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.280]   and you should capitalize on it.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.520]   And to your point on making these decisions
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.000]   without thinking too much about them,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.480]   I've often thought about that as a concept,
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:27.480]   which is like big decisions, paradoxically,
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.680]   I find are better made quickly versus slowly.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.140]   And there's this like desire when you have
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.760]   a big, big decision, you're like, okay,
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.440]   I'm gonna sit down and make this big chart of pros and cons
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.260]   and spend all this time thinking through them.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.720]   What I tend to find is that your instinct actually
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.040]   is usually pretty good.
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:45.020]   And sometimes you just need to like open the door,
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:47.200]   jump out and like hope you packed your parachute
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.040]   really well.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.880]   I think it ends up making for much better outcomes.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.380]   You don't waste so much time.
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.820]   - I did an episode recently, I haven't aired it yet,
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.840]   where I had a performance coach come in
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:01.040]   and we picked a topic and we just recorded the session.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.320]   And the topic was, I struggle so often
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.760]   of like over optimizations.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.440]   Like I have all these decisions to make.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.240]   And what he actually broke down through
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.640]   this interesting conversation using tactics
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.520]   that we later in the episode talked about,
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.980]   the tactics he was using was that a lot of times
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.920]   most decisions are made emotionally,
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.460]   but you don't think that in the moment.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.420]   Talking about big decisions, it's like you wanna like
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.020]   make your pro and con list, analyze everything.
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.500]   And he's like, you need to stop and not just reflect,
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.260]   but maybe get outside and force yourself
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.240]   into a different state because the emotional decision
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.580]   might actually be the easy way.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.020]   He was basically trying to teach me that this thing
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.260]   that we often think of as like our gut decision
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.980]   might actually be more of like an emotional decision.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.320]   We talked about this exact example I used about my wife
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.400]   and this course, and he was like,
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.600]   it was so easy for you to make that decision
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.960]   'cause you were thinking about it emotionally.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.280]   You weren't in the middle of doing the research.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.440]   And so my new thing is whenever I'm in the middle
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.560]   of trying to make a decision, big or small,
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:59.740]   I try to pause and then get myself out of the research phase
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.560]   not pause and look at my options,
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.440]   pause and look at my spreadsheet,
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.800]   but pause and like go outside for 10 minutes
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   and just think about like, what's the right decision here?
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.400]   And sometimes it just comes to you.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.740]   It doesn't come to you when you're looking at the data.
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:13.740]   It comes to you when you think like,
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.740]   what would the right decision here be?
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:16.580]   - It's interesting.
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:17.860]   I mean, my reflection is just,
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.260]   I've never made a single pro con list
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.700]   that actually swayed my decision.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:24.340]   Like in a movie, they make the pro con list
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.380]   and then they look at the list and like the pros are like,
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.380]   there's 30 of them and the cons, there's like three.
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.980]   And you're like, oh, okay, it's clearly a pro.
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.900]   But like, that's never happened to me in real life.
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.620]   What ends up happening is I just like sit there
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.220]   and stare at something that looks relatively balanced
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.020]   and then you just end up making the decision anyway.
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.860]   It's not like it actually helped me think it through.
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.240]   So I go back and forth.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.160]   I'm like you, right?
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.880]   Like I have all these frameworks
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.680]   and mental models and razors,
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.840]   but it's not like I'm sitting going through a checklist
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.400]   of them when I'm going and making decisions.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.480]   It's sort of, again, things that are in sort
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.160]   of your mental toolkit that you're generally thinking about.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.880]   But like to go back to one, like the optimist razor,
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.240]   it's not like I'm thinking like, okay,
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.360]   well, Chris invited me to do a podcast
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.620]   and Chris is an optimist.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.000]   So I should, okay, by this decision-making,
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.220]   I'm gonna go spend time with Chris.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.240]   It's just like ways to live your life
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.680]   that you just generally are trying to be around optimists
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.640]   or whatever it is.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.480]   I try to avoid being mechanical
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.240]   about how all this stuff gets implemented.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.800]   It's just like general rules and ideas
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.360]   that you have floating around your brain
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.120]   that you're kind of applying to how you live life
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.360]   on a daily basis.
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.280]   - I really like that.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.440]   I was thinking maybe you had the contact sorted
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.480]   by optimist score.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.880]   - Yeah, yeah, optimist score, Chris, 7.2.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.580]   So, okay, we're doing the podcast.
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:36.340]   - I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.840]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.440]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.080]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.460]   as you build your wealth.
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.740]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.600]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.380]   with backgrounds in everything from technology, finance,
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:58.280]   medicine, to real estate, law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.680]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.640]   I've loved being a part of the community
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.940]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.080]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.440]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.160]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.960]   are first generation wealth,
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.040]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.180]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.520]   and learn from each other
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.120]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.400]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.740]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:27.160]   Like I said, I'm a member
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.320]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.760]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.200]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.560]   to your children's education,
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.860]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:41.320]   So many of these conversations
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.520]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:47.200]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.060]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.240]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.300]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.440]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.960]   And if you choose to apply,
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.900]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:04.960]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:08.400]   When it comes to building wealth,
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.080]   taxes are such a big part of the strategy.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.780]   And even if you've already filed,
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.240]   being proactive about this year
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.920]   to lower your future liability is so important.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.600]   And now that I'm working with Gelt,
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.760]   I finally feel like I have a partner I can trust
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.120]   to handle everything for my business and personal taxes.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.600]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.200]   Think of Gelt as the ultimate modern CPA.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.640]   They not only offer an amazing tech platform
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.240]   that gives you personalized guidance
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.080]   to maximize deductions, tax credits, and savings,
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.800]   but also everything is backed by an in-house team
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.040]   of expert CPAs who can recommend
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.940]   the most effective tax strategies
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.160]   to minimize risk and grow your wealth.
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.280]   And best of all, you can have this transparent,
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.040]   open communication with your team
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.960]   in whatever way works best for you,
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.320]   whether that's on their platform, over email,
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:55.480]   in Slack, or scheduling a call.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.760]   Finally, my favorite story
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.840]   is that when we first onboarded with Gelt,
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.360]   they reviewed our past returns
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.160]   and found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:06.040]   So they refiled and got us back all that money.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.920]   So if you're ready for a more premium,
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.520]   proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.400]   you have to check out Gelt.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.880]   And as an All The Hacks listener,
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.400]   you can skip the wait list and get started today.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:21.720]   Just head to allthehacks.com/Gelt, G-E-L-T.
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:25.600]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/G-E-L-T.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.160]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.660]   and supporting the show.

[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.720]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.800]   Okay, so we're not gonna spend all of our time
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.640]   optimizing every decision we make,
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.360]   going through these rubrics every time we do anything.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.880]   Let's talk a little bit about how we spend our time
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.480]   and how we choose what to do with our time.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.080]   So one of the things I know you value is serendipity.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.240]   - I have this concept of luck surface area
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.440]   that I've probably adapted from people
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.440]   that have talked about it over a period of time.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.340]   The first time I ever heard, I think it was serendipity,
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.400]   was this guy Tim Brown, who was the CEO of IDEO,
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.040]   the big design firm.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.840]   And he talked about the whole idea
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.920]   of engineered serendipity, that you could create luck.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.480]   And it was the first time I had ever heard of it.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.320]   This was probably back in 2010 or something like that,
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.840]   I was in college, and it always stuck with me.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.460]   So I've recently been thinking about luck surface area,
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.940]   like the whole idea that you can actually expand
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:34.800]   your surface area for having lucky things happen to you.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.760]   And how you do that is by, again,
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.760]   putting yourself out there.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.360]   It's like, you don't get lucky
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.580]   sitting on the couch watching Netflix at home.
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:44.340]   You get lucky by being out, engaging with people,
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.760]   meeting new people, publishing your work,
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.560]   putting things out there into the world
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.520]   and seeing what can bounce off of it
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.720]   and the connections that can be made.
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.040]   And so my whole idea with the luck razor
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.600]   or with the serendipity razor is,
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.280]   you should always try to expand your luck surface area.
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.000]   Like if you're gonna choose two paths,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.800]   like a decision to make between staying in
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.000]   and watching Netflix on a given evening
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.800]   or going to that opportunity, the dinner,
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.240]   the meeting, the people, whatever it is,
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.760]   or to publish something publicly
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.640]   rather than to just have it sit in your journal,
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.600]   you should take the path
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.480]   that has the larger luck surface area.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.000]   I think this applies mostly when you're trying
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.440]   to expand your luck surface area
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.720]   earlier in your life and in your career.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.840]   Once you've done that and you've figured out
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:28.280]   where the ripest opportunities are,
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.240]   then you can start going deep and you can narrow it.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:33.080]   Like for instance, today, I would probably choose
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.240]   to sit at home and relax and spend time
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.480]   with my wife and son rather than going out
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.480]   and about to some big event.
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.080]   'Cause I don't really feel like I'm trying
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.560]   to get lucky on things anymore.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.120]   I've sort of figured out where my luck has come from
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.220]   and now I'm just going down and digging deeper
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:48.000]   into that area, into that hole.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.640]   But early on, expanding your luck surface area
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.480]   in any way, shape or form early in your life and career,
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.640]   I think is important.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.440]   - I wanna come back to how we do spend our time.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.160]   But let's say you are going out
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.060]   and I'm gonna kind of tee up one other razor,
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.160]   which is there's two rooms.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.520]   How do you pick which one to go to?
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.640]   - The one where you're gonna be the dumbest one in the room.
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.720]   Always, always.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.080]   This is like a common thing that people say is like,
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.480]   if you're the smartest person in the room,
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.760]   you're in the wrong room.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.640]   And I really do believe that.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.900]   Like putting yourself in uncomfortable positions
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.040]   where everyone is smarter than you
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.120]   tends to lead to really interesting things.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.760]   Especially when you pair it with some of the stuff
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.720]   we talked about earlier,
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.440]   of like good ways to get those kind of people talking,
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.160]   good ways to think about how you can be valuable to them,
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.800]   how you can stick out in their minds,
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.400]   like walking away from the conversation.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.700]   Like you said, I like that one a lot.
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:33.680]   I'm gonna steal that.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.640]   Sending people books, et cetera.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.640]   Just getting into rooms
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.520]   where you feel a little bit uncomfortable,
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.800]   that's where you end up having the most growth come.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.840]   - I love just walking up to a table of people.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.720]   I'm like, I have no idea what you're talking,
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:47.400]   like let me just listen and it's super uncomfortable.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:48.960]   - Yeah, it is super uncomfortable.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.480]   And you could do it in a weird way.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.480]   But in the right environment,
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.560]   I think it's wildly interesting.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.040]   - Yeah, I'm going to this event
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.480]   in Santa Barbara in a couple weeks.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.920]   And there's a lot of wildly successful people
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.200]   that it looks like are gonna be there.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.540]   And I literally don't know a single person.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:06.740]   And today I was like,
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:09.840]   man, it's gonna be really hard to go and do this.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.080]   'Cause I don't even have like a wingman.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.060]   Like I don't have like a friend who's like my guy
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:14.200]   that I can like go around with,
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.340]   or girl that I can go around with.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:16.800]   I literally don't know anyone.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.280]   And I feel like a total imposter going to this event
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.000]   because everyone is CEOs,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.880]   like really, really impressive people.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.080]   I had to like snap myself out of it and just say like,
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.000]   oh, what a cool opportunity to just be in this room.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.360]   You can just go listen to people
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.920]   and add value in some other way other than talking.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.100]   I'm excited for it now.
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:35.320]   - But I wanna come back finally to where we spend our time.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.780]   And you have a Time Billionaire Razor,
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.840]   but you actually did a really great post about this
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.100]   and looked at some data on how we spend time.
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:43.540]   So maybe let's end talking about how we spend our time
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.000]   and how that's evolved for you.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.920]   - This is a topic that's very near and dear to my heart.
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:47.940]   You have young kids.
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.400]   I have a, I guess by the time this comes out,
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.320]   he will be one.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:56.060]   And I have thought about time more in the last year
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.600]   than I had my entire life.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:01.320]   Part of that is because when you have a young kid,
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:05.200]   you all of a sudden start measuring time in weeks
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:08.200]   and months, which you never really do otherwise.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.440]   Like people ask you how old the kid is
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.240]   and you say like six weeks or nine weeks
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.520]   or 12 weeks, whatever.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.500]   I've never thought about the passage of weeks
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:15.920]   as a passage of time in the past.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.440]   It's just like another week.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.680]   A lot of people have now seen that like life calendar,
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.080]   like Memento Mori calendar,
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.680]   where it's 52 rows across and it's 80 rows down.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.160]   So it represents your entire life.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:28.120]   Every row is a year and the 80 rows is your life.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.320]   And you fill in black every week that goes by.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.240]   So you can literally see the passage of your life,
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.660]   passage of time.
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.760]   So I've been thinking about this stuff more and more
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.440]   over the course of the last year.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:41.300]   And I came across this American Time Use Survey data set
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.820]   that I think it was Our World and Data
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.560]   kind of crunched together to look at how we spend time
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:47.800]   over the course of our lives
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:50.040]   and specifically who we spend it with.
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.840]   They had kind of combined it into a single chart
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.000]   of all of these lines,
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.700]   like how much time you spend with your children,
[00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:56.960]   how much time you spend with your parents,
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.960]   how much time you spend with friends,
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.840]   coworkers, alone, et cetera.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.960]   I went in and downloaded the data
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.700]   and split it out into individual charts
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.680]   that you could really see like each line
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.640]   and kind of the curvature of each line.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:10.800]   And it was an unbelievably powerful image
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.220]   when you look at them individually, especially with kids,
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:16.520]   how you like basically spend all of your time with them
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:19.000]   during this like very short window of their life
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.460]   and then you falls off a cliff.
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:23.120]   And the reverse of that is with your parents,
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.200]   you spend almost all of your time with them
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.800]   over the first 18 years of your life
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.000]   and then it just goes like this
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.480]   and you're not spending time for the rest of your life.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.240]   And so it just brought to the fore
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.360]   all of these really difficult conversations,
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.760]   but also sort of empowering ones
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.100]   for who you spend your time with,
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.920]   who you want to be spending your time with
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:45.080]   and how you want to sort of change the curves as it were
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.880]   over the course of your life.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:49.440]   - And so have you made changes in the last year
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:51.400]   as a result of thinking about this?
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.960]   - Yeah, I mean, the biggest change we made
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.920]   was in May, 2021, where we picked up our life
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.560]   and sold our house in California,
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:59.260]   bought a house in New York
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:01.160]   and moved to be closer to my parents
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.440]   and to my wife's parents.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:04.360]   And that was based on the initial realization
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.460]   of how little time we had left with our parents,
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:09.480]   not because they're particularly old or sick, knock on wood,
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.920]   but just based on math.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.600]   And their age, our age,
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.760]   how often we were seeing them about once a year.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:18.200]   And now I see my parents at least a few times a month.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.560]   They're like a big, big part of my son's life,
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:22.040]   similar with my wife's parents.
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:25.120]   They're constantly around and it makes a huge difference.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.720]   And it makes them so happy too,
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.220]   to be a part of our lives, to be a part of our son's life.
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.400]   So that was a huge life change.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.200]   And then the kids one is the biggest for me
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.880]   in terms of what it's done in the last year.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.680]   This friend of mine, Kay,
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.780]   who has talked about the magic window,
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.360]   I think he calls it or the magic years,
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:42.960]   which is like this 10 year period of time
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.960]   where you are your kid's favorite person in the world.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.940]   And once they're older than 10,
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:49.480]   there are other people that fill that role.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.840]   They have best friends, they have girlfriends, boyfriends,
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:53.560]   they get married, they're going to have kids,
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.960]   like they're going to go on and live their entire life
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.960]   where you as their parent are not really
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.480]   like the central figure and actor.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.620]   But during this 10 year window, you are.
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.480]   And they love you more than anyone else in the world.
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.880]   Yet we live in a culture where traditionally,
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:09.760]   those are the years where you're also working the most
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.480]   and like trying to make the most of your life
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:12.320]   and of your career.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.280]   We were talking about this earlier,
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.880]   like your life is really good,
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.520]   but you also want more from your career
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:18.960]   or from businesses you're building.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.200]   How do you balance those two?
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:23.160]   Because anything you decide to do or take on
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:25.480]   is a direct trade off of time with your kids.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.280]   If you're going to be grinding on some business
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.880]   or project or working,
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.720]   that's just time away that you could be spending with them.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:34.420]   And so how do you figure out and find the balance of that?
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.360]   I've been thinking about that more and more and more.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.320]   And being home during this like first year of my kid's life
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.880]   and getting to spend tons of time with him
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:45.640]   and really build a bond with him is meaningful to me.
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.920]   - And so does that mean saying no
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:48.800]   to a lot more professional things?
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.620]   - I mean, like I say no to 99% of opportunities
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:52.460]   that come my way.
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:55.580]   And now, I mean, by virtue of the scale of my platform
[00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:57.560]   and how it's been growing,
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.420]   it's a lot of stuff and a lot of financial things
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:01.760]   that I'm just turning down out of hand.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.760]   And for me, that's been a conscious decision
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:07.080]   of I don't actually particularly find myself motivated
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:07.960]   by money all that much.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.000]   So I actually don't feel like I need much more money
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   than I have today.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.800]   And we have a great house and we like our life a lot.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.200]   We're happy and I have tons of time at home
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.480]   and free time with my son.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:19.360]   And I actually wouldn't change that much.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:22.880]   Like if you offered to pay me today $50 million
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.780]   to work 80 hours a week this year, I would not do it.
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:27.640]   Full stop, like wouldn't even consider it.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:29.120]   And that's a pretty empowering feeling
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.000]   when you realize the priorities and the trade-offs.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.360]   But that, I mean, to me, just like really being ruthless
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:39.520]   about what my North star is and what I wanna focus on
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:42.080]   has been a pretty liberating thing
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:44.120]   and a really meaningful thing for me.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.880]   - What do you think's helped you not wanna play
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:47.960]   Keeping Up With The Joneses,
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:52.240]   which I feel like many of our peers are still feeling that?
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:55.220]   - I think the biggest thing is avoiding
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.900]   the like when then psychology around this stuff.
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.520]   I saw a great clip of Dax Shepard
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.800]   recently talking about this
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:03.120]   and how he had all of the trappings
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.520]   that he thought were gonna make him happy and successful.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.040]   And he had convinced himself all on the way
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.720]   that like, well, when that thing happened,
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:11.040]   then I'm gonna be happy and this will be great.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.480]   And then he got that and he realized he was like suicidal
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.720]   and not happy at all.
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:16.120]   And so it was really liberating
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.800]   then on the backend of getting healed
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.000]   and treated for all of that to realize,
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.040]   oh, those external things
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.700]   aren't actually gonna ever make me happy.
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:24.200]   He saw it really viscerally.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.400]   Most people never have that.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.720]   You don't realize that all of those games
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:28.660]   you're playing in your mind,
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:31.580]   like, well, when I get to vice president or whatever,
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:32.420]   then I'll be happy
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:33.760]   and I'm gonna be making all this more money.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:36.600]   Or when I get a million followers on whatever platform,
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.620]   then I'm gonna be really happy.
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:38.460]   I'm gonna have made it.
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:39.480]   Things are gonna be good.
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:42.480]   The reality is if you're looking for something external
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.920]   to be what creates your internal happiness,
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:45.920]   it's never gonna work out.
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.520]   Happiness is full on inside job.
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:51.520]   Like you have to be finding happiness from something
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:54.440]   that is a deeper meaning, deeper purpose, something internal.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.160]   It can't be some external achievement
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.260]   because it just doesn't last.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:00.120]   You just revert to whatever the next when is
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.560]   that you're gonna create.
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:02.540]   So for me personally,
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:04.780]   I've realized that I stepped off the treadmill
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:05.620]   around all those things.
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:07.640]   That doesn't mean that I don't want more
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.760]   because I am motivated by growth,
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:13.420]   but the growth is an internal thing versus an external thing.
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:17.060]   It's not, hey, I wanna like make X dollars
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.220]   or do this or that.
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.500]   It's like, I wanna feel like I'm getting better at things.
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.780]   And if that's getting better at being a dad, that's great.
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:24.500]   If that's getting better at running,
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.260]   'cause I'm like really into running right now,
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:27.100]   then that's great.
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:29.580]   But it's not, I wanna get a better house
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:30.780]   and I wanna get a better car.
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:33.740]   And I wanna like, that guy got this, so I wanna do that.
[00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:37.140]   It's just turned everything internal in a much deeper way.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:39.420]   - The way I describe it for me is I wanna feel pulled
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.120]   into things instead of pushed into things now.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.380]   And so I had a friend who was like,
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:44.220]   I wanna start a company.
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:45.580]   I was like, why do you wanna start a company?
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.000]   You know, you started a company, you've done this,
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.100]   you've been successful.
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.860]   The more he thought about it, he was like, well,
[00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:51.120]   I feel like I don't know what I wanna do.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.180]   And I was like, just wait till there's a thing
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:54.900]   that's pulling you towards it
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.180]   instead of trying to push yourself into it.
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:58.340]   That's what I try to look for,
[00:58:58.340 --> 00:58:59.740]   which is ultimately why I left.
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:02.940]   I was like, I just feel that I have to go do this full time.
[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:05.260]   - Yeah, and the other way to think about it is,
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.500]   again, I think this is from Tim Ferriss.
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.660]   He has this question of what am I saying no to
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:11.460]   by saying yes to this?
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.420]   And I think about that constantly in the context of family
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:16.820]   and in the context of what my priorities are.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:18.820]   I mean, like if my son is my number one priority
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:20.020]   in the world right now,
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:22.340]   then building a deep relationship with him
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.700]   over this next 10 years and really, really having
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:27.420]   that closeness and that bond,
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.780]   anytime some new opportunity comes along,
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:31.700]   I have to think that question through and think about,
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:33.740]   okay, what am I saying no to with him
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:34.780]   by saying yes to this?
[00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.700]   Like if some new travel comes up
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:38.500]   and someone wants me to go and speak at something
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:40.660]   and it's gonna require me being gone for a few weeks,
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:41.640]   what am I gonna miss?
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.660]   Like, what am I gonna be saying no to?
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:45.780]   And it might be $50,000 that someone wants me
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:48.100]   to come speak at something and they're gonna pay
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:49.140]   and it's gonna be this cool trip
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:50.700]   and I'm gonna get to go to this cool place.
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:53.540]   But if I'm missing his birthday party,
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:55.860]   like hell no, there's no amount of money
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:56.860]   you could pay me, right?
[00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:58.380]   And so really thinking that through
[00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:00.180]   and it might not be kids, maybe it's something else,
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.260]   maybe it's time with your family,
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:04.020]   maybe it's some hobby that you really enjoy
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:06.540]   or a trip with friends that you really wanted to take
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.260]   that you're gonna have to say no to
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.660]   because of some new work thing
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.080]   that you're gonna really have to dive into
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.820]   if you get the opportunity.
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:14.260]   Thinking through those trade-offs,
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.600]   I think is a really healthy thing to do,
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.140]   but it requires you to sit back
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.540]   and figure out what your priorities are.
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.660]   What are the core ways that you're gonna measure
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.020]   the success of your life at the end of the day?
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:26.100]   - That could be a whole nother episode,
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.740]   so we're not gonna go down that path.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.540]   But I will say that my hack here is
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.940]   I took a lot of time to craft what I thought
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.860]   was like my perfect no email
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:36.100]   and then I made it a snippet
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.740]   so that I could just fire it off anytime
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.180]   and someone's like, "Hey, I really wanna talk
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:40.020]   "about this thing."
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.620]   And I'm like, "I'm heads down."
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:42.660]   I should probably just publish it
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.180]   'cause people could steal it.
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.200]   It's like, "I'm really heads down,
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.720]   "focusing on stuff that's important.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.220]   "Feel free to shoot me an email,
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:49.760]   "but not gonna have time to meet.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.100]   "Really appreciate you reaching out.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:52.660]   "It means a lot, thanks."
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:53.500]   - I do the same.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:57.140]   And by making it easy, I use it so much more.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.560]   And honestly, the difference between thinking about it
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:03.220]   and having it as like a keyboard shortcut level ease
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:06.980]   makes me send it so often and feel okay about it.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:10.100]   And I got this from Derek Sivers who was like,
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.200]   "If you're always busy and you can never meet with anyone,
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.440]   "you're kind of projecting
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.640]   "that you can't prioritize your own time.
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.000]   "And if you leave free time in your calendar,
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.100]   "you're able to take advantage of things
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.980]   "when they happen that are really interesting."
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:24.420]   And so I'm trying to live by that.
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:26.420]   It's hard because especially when you're younger,
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:27.540]   it's like every opportunity
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.740]   could be more serendipity, more serendipity.
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:31.540]   But I feel like as we have families
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:33.200]   and we kind of understand our areas,
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.060]   you've got to really do it.
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:36.920]   So I appreciate you saying yes to this
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.940]   because there's always so much knowledge
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:40.340]   that gets dropped doing it.
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:41.940]   Where do you want to send people today
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:43.420]   who are listening and want to stay on top
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:44.260]   of what you're doing?
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.900]   - I guess my newsletter is probably the best.
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:47.700]   Sahobloom.com/newsletter
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:49.100]   takes you straight to the newsletter,
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.380]   but everything's on my website.
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:53.180]   - And then I'm on all social platforms @sahobloom.
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.700]   The virtue of having a weird name
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.580]   is you get your own handle.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:57.740]   - Kind messages only.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.260]   - Yeah, kind messages only.
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:00.780]   If you send me the mean ones, I won't reply,
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.980]   but I will feel empathy for you.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:03.820]   - Amazing.
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:04.980]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:05.900]   - Awesome, thanks.
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.820]   - That was so great.
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.740]   And as much as traveling across the country
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:11.740]   takes a toll on you,
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:14.060]   I do really enjoy having some of these conversations
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:14.900]   in person.
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:17.260]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode as much as I did.
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:18.740]   So please let me know what you think
