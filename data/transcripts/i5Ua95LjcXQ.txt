[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   You will remember that three weeks ago when we last met together, we had arrived at the
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:14.360]   end of the 30th verse in the third chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, and had
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.480]   to leave over the 31st verse, the last verse in this third chapter of Paul's epistle
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:31.040]   to the Romans, which reads like this, "Do we then make void the law through faith?
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.280]   God forbid.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.200]   Yea, we establish the law."
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:46.640]   Now here we are looking at the third of the things which the apostle tells us characterize
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:55.080]   this way of salvation, this righteousness from God in Jesus Christ, which has now been
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.520]   brought in.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.480]   We have already seen that there were two other characteristics.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.840]   The first was that it was a way of salvation that entirely does away with any boasting
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.840]   in men.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.400]   All boasting is removed.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.240]   Where is the boasting then, he asks?
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.240]   He says it is excluded.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:26.960]   In the second place, we saw that it is a way of salvation that abolishes distinctions between
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:35.320]   men, especially between the Jews and the Gentiles, but also at the same time every other distinction,
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.400]   because by this way of salvation we are all in the same position, and all our terms about
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.760]   which the natural man makes so much is good and bad and so on.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.760]   They are all irrelevant.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.160]   There is none, just no, not one.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.080]   And that is established not only by the law, but by the death of our Lord upon the cross.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.960]   The cross of Jesus Christ convicts everybody of sin, of helplessness and hopelessness.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.860]   There is no longer, therefore, any difference between the Jew and the Gentile in this matter
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.180]   of salvation.
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.680]   God is not the God of the Jews only, but also of Gentiles, seeing it is one God who shall
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.880]   justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.160]   And we saw that there was a very practical, modern application to that teaching.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.440]   Now that brings us to this third characteristic.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.920]   I have been describing them thus as characteristics of this way of salvation, and so they are.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:51.600]   But we can also describe them as three deductions which the apostle is drawing from his description
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.300]   of the way of salvation.
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.560]   In other words, he says, now because this is the way of salvation, we must therefore
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.780]   always deduce that there is no bursting, that there is no difference between different kinds
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.380]   of people.
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.280]   Now then, we come to the third deduction, or the third characteristic of this way of
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.220]   salvation.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:22.060]   And that is that the gospel, this way of salvation in Jesus Christ and him crucified, this way
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:31.100]   of salvation which has been brought to pass because God has set him forth as a propitiation
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.140]   through faith in his blood.
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:42.700]   Because of that I say we deduce this, that the gospel establishes the law.
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.300]   That's the third deduction.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.140]   Now the apostle puts that to us in rather an interesting way.
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.580]   He asks again another of his rhetorical questions.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.940]   I've been reading here the authorised translation, "Do we then make void the law through faith?"
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.300]   But actually the order in which the apostle put it was this.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:16.420]   The law, do we make it of no effect through this faith or through the faith?
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.180]   Now that's a better way of putting it.
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.620]   The law, do we make it void or of no effect through the faith?
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.580]   It isn't faith but the faith, through the faith.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.280]   He means by the faith, of course, this message, this particular message concerning this way
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.740]   of righteousness that has now come in.
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.420]   He's not talking about our faith, he's talking about the message.
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.980]   Do we make void the law through this preaching of salvation by faith in Jesus Christ, the
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:56.620]   message, the faith, the faith principle, if you like, which God is now using in contradistinction
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.740]   to any kind of works?
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.060]   And having put his rhetorical question, the apostle answers it at once by the words here
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.180]   translated "God forbid," which really means "May it not be."
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.620]   It's unthinkable.
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.700]   Now the apostle, you see, here is speaking very strongly.
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.940]   We found that he's already done this before.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.880]   He's already used the same expression at the beginning of this third chapter.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.180]   He says "For what if some did not believe, shall their unbelief make the faith of God
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.180]   without effect?
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.180]   God forbid."
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:43.820]   Now, he uses these strong expressions because there were people who were very ready indeed
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.900]   to draw these false deductions, and there are still people who are ready to draw these
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.940]   false deductions.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.460]   But the thing is so abhorrent to the apostle that he says "May it not be, don't even think
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.500]   it, don't even come near to suggesting it."
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.460]   The thing is quite unthinkable.
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:09.560]   Very well then, we must discover if we can the reasons for this sense of abhorrence which
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.220]   the apostle feels at the mere suggestion of it, and at once he goes on to give us the
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.220]   reason.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:23.780]   He says "God forbid, yea, rather we establish the law.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.260]   Far from making the law of none effect, we are helping it to stand.
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.380]   We are establishing it.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.380]   We are really showing what a wonderful thing it is."
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.540]   Well now, what I want to try to do this evening is to show you that there is nothing which
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:50.740]   rarely so establishes the law as this doctrine that we are saved by the redemption that is
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:57.140]   in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.300]   In other words, what I'm going to do is this.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:08.580]   I'm going to show and to establish the fact that it is only as we interpret this teaching
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:14.460]   we've been looking at in the way that we have done that this verse really follows.
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.620]   And that other interpretations of this teaching concerning the atonement do not establish
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.840]   the law.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.580]   And that is our final way of proving that they're wrong.
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.340]   Any way of salvation that we believe in, any doctrine of the atonement that we may hold,
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.740]   must always establish the law.
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.940]   Now how therefore are we to interpret this statement?
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.660]   Well it has been interpreted in two ways.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:50.940]   There are some who say that what the apostle means by the law here is the Old Testament,
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.300]   the Old Testament scriptures.
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.620]   And that what he is saying therefore at this point is this, that in giving you this teaching
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:06.660]   concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ransoming work upon the cross, and the value of his
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:12.460]   shed blood, I am not making the Old Testament of no value.
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:18.460]   With all its history and all it's got to say about the Jews, I'm not nullifying all that
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.860]   Old Testament history and teaching.
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:26.460]   And they would argue that that is the right interpretation because they say, the apostle
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:33.020]   goes on in what is described as chapter 4 in our Bibles to say this, "What shall we
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:38.500]   then say that Abram our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found?"
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.260]   In other words they say he's going back to Old Testament history, and he's going to talk
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.380]   about Abram and he's going to talk about David.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:54.100]   So surely he is using this term, the law, as a term to mean the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.220]   Now that was sometimes done.
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.760]   The Jews did sometimes refer to the whole of the Old Testament as the law, believing
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:07.580]   as they did that the law of Moses was the most important thing in the Old Testament,
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.980]   they tended to regard the whole book as the book of the law, the law.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:21.100]   But I think there are some very good reasons why we cannot accept that interpretation.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.640]   And here are some of them.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:31.460]   In the whole context from verse 21 onwards, the apostle has really been speaking about
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:40.740]   the Mosaic law, the law given through Moses, the moral and the ceremonial law, and especially
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.420]   the moral law.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.620]   That's been the thing about which he has been speaking.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.620]   And therefore it would be a strange thing if suddenly and without giving us any notice
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.940]   or any warning or any indication that he was doing so, he should suddenly change the meaning
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:04.820]   of the word and begin to use it in terms of describing the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:10.500]   Now that's a very good principle which we should always bear in mind when we're interpreting
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.160]   the Scriptures.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.500]   If a term has been used in a sense in a number of verses, well it isn't likely that its
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.180]   sense is suddenly going to be changed without any indication of that.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.600]   And there is no indication whatsoever at this point.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:31.220]   And then taking up this other matter that what we are told in the fourth chapter certainly
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.640]   does go back into history.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:40.100]   But you notice that it doesn't start with the word "for."
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:46.580]   And surely if the apostle were here speaking in verse 31 of the Old Testament history,
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.040]   which he certainly is going on to do in chapter 4, the connecting word would have been the
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.180]   word "for."
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.840]   But it isn't.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:00.440]   He obviously is taking up an entirely new subject, as I hope to show you, in chapter
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.440]   4.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.460]   Whereas if it were a continuance of this matter dealt with in chapter 3 from verse 21 to the
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:12.960]   end, well then I say the natural connecting link would have been "for."
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.960]   But it isn't.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:20.200]   Well therefore on those two grounds, I reject that interpretation and suggest to you that
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:26.160]   the apostle here is referring to the Mosaic law.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.120]   The law which God gave the children of Israel through Moses, saying unto them as he gave
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.200]   it, "If you can keep it, it will save you."
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.400]   The law that we've been considering at such length in both chapters 2 and 3.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:47.800]   Now then, the apostle's assertion is that this way of salvation establishes that law.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.700]   It holds it up.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.000]   It shows what a wonderful thing it was.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.920]   Indeed nothing else so establishes it.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:05.480]   Therefore we see once more that that teaching which is current in certain circles today,
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:11.040]   which tells us that under the new dispensation that the law of the Old Testament has been
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.560]   entirely abolished and put aside, and that we now are confronted by a new law which is
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.920]   the law of faith.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.880]   That henceforward we have nothing to do but just to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.240]   and the law is of no value or of no worth any longer.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:34.640]   That surely is at once seen to be entirely wrong.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.880]   Because if we teach that the old law has really been thrown overboard and has been replaced
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.320]   by a new law, we obviously are not establishing that old law.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.120]   We are dismissing it.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.360]   We are throwing it, as I say, overboard.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.920]   We are jettisoning it.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.960]   But the apostle here is concerned to say the exact opposite.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:03.400]   So we must never teach that that law has gone and that all that the Christian now has to
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.600]   face and all he'll have to face at the bar of judgment, or all that anybody will have
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:14.640]   to face at the bar of judgment, is this new law of faith, of believing in Christ.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:21.840]   I say we see that that is entirely wrong, and the apostle has already made that plain
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:28.240]   and clear to us in verse 27, which we have already considered.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.280]   Very well, that can't be the explanation.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.660]   Well then, what does he mean?
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:39.360]   How does this teaching establish the law?
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.120]   Well now, here again there is a popular teaching at the present time, to which I must unfortunately
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.760]   call attention, because it's very common indeed.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:54.760]   And there less, it's not only taught by those who are regarded as liberals in their
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:14:01.000]   theology, but unfortunately it has creeped in now and again, even into the writings of
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.600]   those that are generally considered to be evangelical.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.040]   It's this.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:13.360]   We are told that it works in this way, that what the apostle means is that by means of
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:22.080]   our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, we are now enabled to live the law.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.720]   We are enabled to keep the law.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:32.560]   They say, you see, something like this, that the risen Christ gives us strength and power
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.680]   which enables us to keep and to honor and to fulfill the law by living the good life,
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.760]   the Christian life.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:44.080]   Even so, we are establishing the law by living it.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:52.320]   You see, don't you, how specious an argument and an exposition that is.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:59.040]   You may have noticed it during this last Easter, how suggestions were made that we are really
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.200]   saved by the risen Christ.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.760]   We are not saved by the death of Christ, but by the resurrection.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.480]   Have you noticed this?
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:12.920]   How the cross is being bypassed today and that salvation is regarded just as this, that
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:18.000]   this risen Christ, who is still alive, if we look to him and ask him for help, will
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.640]   give us help to live the Christian life.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.000]   And as we live the Christian life, we are incidentally honoring the law, keeping the
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.040]   law, and thereby establishing the law.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.480]   Now this, therefore, is something that we really must look at, because it is, I want
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:40.920]   to try to show you, entirely false and completely negative, the very thing the apostle is trying
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.360]   to say.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.800]   The first answer I would give to that teaching is this.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:56.320]   The apostle in this third chapter is not considering sanctification at all.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.480]   He is only considering justification.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.460]   But the moment you begin to talk about living a life and living the Christian life and living
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.400]   a good life, you are talking about sanctification.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.600]   And you see, what that teaching really comes to in the end is this, that you are really
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.720]   justified because you are sanctified.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.680]   Now that was always, and still is, the Roman Catholic teaching on justification.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:27.840]   They say that a man is justified before God because he is sanctified, because he is enabled
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:33.120]   to live the good life by the grace that he received in baptism, the grace he receives
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:38.440]   as he partakes of the wafer in the Lord's Supper, this infused grace, and the help he
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.640]   gets from the saints and various others, like the Virgin Mary.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:48.480]   As he is enabled by grace to live this good life, he justifies himself.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.480]   Well this teaching, you see, really amounts to the same thing.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.880]   Now the apostle here isn't dealing with sanctification at all.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.600]   It isn't mentioned.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.320]   But what he is dealing with is justification by faith.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.880]   Actually we all ought to be perfectly clear about that.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:10.880]   Here he says in verse 20, "Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.880]   in his sight."
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.680]   That's not the way of justification.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:22.600]   Well what is it in verse 24, being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.560]   that is in Christ Jesus?
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.560]   That's the way.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.960]   And this is his theme right through to the end of the chapter, and as it will be right
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:39.540]   through chapter 4, and right through chapter 5, until you come to about verse 10 and 11.
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:46.520]   So we reject that teaching simply because it introduces the element of sanctification
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.400]   into a paragraph which is dealing with nothing but justification.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:58.520]   But not only that, as you see, it is a complete denial of the apostle's teaching of the
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.720]   doctrine of justification by faith only.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.360]   It does, as I have just been saying, take you back to a doctrine of justification by
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.120]   works.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.480]   The fact that the Lord Jesus Christ enables us to live the works doesn't make any difference
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.120]   at that point.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.960]   It means that it's our works again, however produced, that really are the means of our
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.960]   justification.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.440]   So we must reject it in total.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:31.280]   Because the apostle's whole point, as we've seen, is this, that justification is something
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.440]   forensic.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:42.160]   Justification, may I remind you once more, is that declaration of God that we are regarded
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:48.800]   in his sight as just because of the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.720]   Now that is what is meant by justification.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:59.440]   It is a declaration, a forensic, a legal declaration by God that though we are still, as it were,
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.120]   in our sins, he regards us as just.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:10.920]   He gives us the righteousness of Christ by faith and pronounces us to be just and accepted
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:16.040]   and righteous in his most holy sight.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:22.200]   Very well then, what the apostle is saying here is this, that God's way of declaring
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:29.680]   those who believe in Christ to be righteous and imputing to them Christ's righteousness
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.760]   honors and establishes the law.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.480]   Very well, how does it do so?
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:43.960]   Well, here it seems to me the answer is to the question.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.040]   The apostle is, in a sense, just repeating, of course, what our Lord himself said in the
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.280]   Sermon on the Mount.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:54.880]   Do you remember the statement in the fifth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew,
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.000]   in chapter 5, verses 17 and 18?
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.400]   Listen, "Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.480]   I am not come to destroy but to fulfill.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:15.440]   For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:22.840]   no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled."
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:32.680]   And of course, our Lord himself established the law by fulfilling it in every conceivable
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.640]   respect.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.360]   And that is what the apostle is here saying.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.840]   He says, does somebody say that by showing that the only way of salvation is in and through
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:50.720]   Jesus Christ and him crucified, by his blood, which is the purchased price to ransom us
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:56.160]   out of the clutches of the law and of the devil and of death, is anybody arguing, says
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:01.600]   the apostle, that by preaching this I am some way or another putting the law entirely apart
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.080]   and saying that it really doesn't matter at all?
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.080]   Not at all.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:12.800]   He says, this way of salvation and of redemption, above everything else, honors the law in all
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.800]   ways.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   In what ways?
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   Well, first of all, the Lord Jesus Christ honored the law in his active obedience.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:28.840]   We are told of him by the apostle in the epistle to the Galatians, chapter 4, verse 6, that
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:35.160]   he was made of a woman, made under the law.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:41.400]   He deliberately placed himself, and God placed him, under the law, as a man.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:48.720]   Though he was entirely free from sin, he came and was made under the law.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:55.680]   And he set out to obey and to honor God's law in every jot and tittle, and he did it
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.440]   perfectly and completely.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:03.800]   You remember his famous phrase, "Thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:08.280]   He says that to John the Baptist, who was demonstrating with him and saying, "No, no,
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.480]   I won't baptize you.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.800]   You ought to be baptizing me."
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.280]   "No, no," he says, "thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:21.760]   He puts himself under the law, and he gave a perfect obedience to God's holy law.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.040]   He never sinned.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.320]   He said, "Who is it that can bring any charge against me?"
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.600]   He said, "Satan is coming, the prince of this world, cometh, but findeth nothing in
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.600]   me."
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.040]   If he could have found anything, he would have brought it forward.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.700]   If the authorities could have found anything, they would have.
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.340]   They had nothing to bring forward, so they tried to invent a case.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.200]   They stated a lie, which they couldn't prove.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.760]   No one could point a finger.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.880]   He never sinned.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.800]   He never disobeyed God.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   He honored the law of God perfectly, absolutely, and entirely in his holy life of obedience.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:04.440]   But then, of course, still more strikingly, as the apostle has been putting it forward
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:14.640]   here, he did so in his passive obedience upon the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:22.400]   The law not only demands an obedience, the law also pronounces judgment upon failure
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.560]   to keep it.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.760]   And mankind had sinned, all have sinned and have come short, there is none righteous,
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:35.440]   no not one, and the law is demanding and claiming its penalties.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.840]   And it must be fulfilled in that respect.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.740]   And if this way of salvation doesn't answer that demand of the law, it doesn't establish
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.740]   the law.
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.880]   But it did.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.800]   The apostle has put that in that great phrase already, that he might be just and the justifier
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.480]   of him which believeth in Jesus.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:01.480]   But here he is saying it in a slightly different form, but it is essentially the same thing.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:08.860]   By taking upon himself the punishment of our sins, meted out by the law, the Lord Jesus
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:14.060]   Christ was establishing the law.
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:21.840]   So by making his soul an offering for sin, by going and being led as a lamb and a sheep
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:30.300]   to the slaughter, in this passive obedience, in allowing God to lay upon him the iniquity
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:38.240]   of us all, without murmuring or complaining or running away from it, in his passive obedience,
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.760]   he establishes the law.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.520]   But there are other ways in which I want to show you how he does this.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:54.640]   Here are a number of other things which we must always bear in mind as we consider this
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:59.360]   most important verse.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:05.720]   The Lord Jesus Christ, by his work and indeed God himself, by what he has done in and through
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:16.960]   Christ, confirms and reveals more clearly than ever before what the law says about the
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.680]   holiness and the righteousness of God.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.200]   Now we must never lose sight of that fact.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:34.320]   One of the primary functions of the law was to reveal the holiness and the righteousness
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.320]   of God.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:42.040]   You read again the Ten Commandments as they are given in the twentieth chapter of the
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:47.560]   book of Exodus, and there you will find that that is its great emphasis.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:54.400]   It is summed up like this in a phrase, "God says, 'Be ye holy, for I am holy.'
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:00.480]   That is it, I am holy, and you are to be holy because I am holy."
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:07.840]   The first function of the law is to reveal and to make clear to us the utter, absolute,
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:15.840]   indescribable holiness and righteousness of God.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:22.340]   There is nothing that shows that so plainly and so clearly as what happened on the cross
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:26.080]   on Calvary's hill.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:32.620]   And if you and I do not see first and foremost on that cross a manifestation of the holiness
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:37.920]   and the righteousness of God, we are not seeing it truly.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.140]   It establishes the law in that way.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.740]   It brings that out.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.880]   But come, it does it secondly in this way.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:55.400]   It confirms everything that God had said in his law about his holy wrath against sin.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:04.440]   God in the law had said that he hated sin, that sin aroused his holy wrath, and that
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.200]   he would most certainly and surely punish sin.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.440]   Now it is not I who am saying this.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.720]   The law of God says all that.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.600]   Read the law for yourselves and you will find that God goes on repeating it.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:23.280]   "I hate these things," he says, "and he threatens punishment upon all who are disobedient.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.640]   If they obey, they will be blessed."
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:31.000]   Mounts, Ebel, and Gerizim, blessing and cursing, he kept on saying it.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.440]   And he laid it down in that law that his wrath was against sin and against the men who committed
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:44.280]   sin, and that he would most certainly punish it.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:51.960]   All that we have read in this third chapter brings that out in a most amazing manner.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:57.080]   There is nothing in the whole of history, there is no point in the whole course of man's
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:03.120]   life, there is no place in the universe, which has so manifested the wrath of God against
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:13.920]   sin, his detestation of it, and his determination to punish it, so much as the death of our
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.560]   Lord upon the cross.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:22.320]   Now we have seen that in detail already when we consider that word "propitiation."
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.120]   That word I have told you so many today are trying to take out and to put expiation in
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:30.000]   its place, but Paul said "propitiation."
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.280]   And it is that word that brings out the wrath of God.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:40.400]   And you do not establish the law unless you show the wrath of God, and it is being poured
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.000]   out upon sin.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.280]   The thing God said he would do, God has done, and thereby this way of salvation establishes
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.280]   the law.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.560]   But a way of salvation that does away with propitiation does not establish the law, and
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.480]   therefore it cannot be right.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:01.240]   Well let me go on, it does it in another way.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:07.200]   This way of salvation confirms everything that the law has said about our sin and about
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.240]   our sinfulness.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.660]   The business of the law Paul has already told us is this, "By the deeds of the law there
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:19.880]   shall no flesh be justified in his sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin."
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:24.440]   We know that "what thingsoever the law saith, it saith to them that are under the law, that
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:30.200]   every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be guilty before God."
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.480]   The law says that.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.900]   Does the cross on Calvary's hill say that?
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:42.720]   If it doesn't, it doesn't establish the law, but it does.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:51.880]   What the cross of Calvary is saying is this, that nothing but that can save any soul, that
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:56.400]   all are lost, all are helpless, all are hopeless.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.400]   It proclaims that.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:03.880]   And if our view of the cross doesn't proclaim that, I say once more, it must be false, because
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.380]   this way establishes the law.
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.080]   And there was my fourth point, I've already mentioned it.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:19.440]   It confirms also our utter inability and our complete helplessness and hopelessness.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:25.780]   So that brings me to the fifth point, which is this one.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:32.660]   In that law, you remember, given through Moses, we have also a number of types, all about
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:38.700]   burnt offerings and sacrifices, and how the high priest went in once every year into that
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:44.700]   holiest of all, not without blood, the blood of bulls and of goats, the sacrifice he offered
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.260]   on behalf of the people.
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.180]   What's the meaning of all these?
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:54.060]   Now this way of salvation, says Paul, shows us the meaning.
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.720]   It therefore establishes them.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.460]   It establishes the law.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.940]   It shows that they were all right, that they were all given by God, and they were all used
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.140]   by God in order to teach these particular truths.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:12.460]   Christ, by dying upon the cross, has fulfilled that Levitical ceremonial law perfectly, absolutely,
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.460]   and entirely.
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:19.700]   He established the law by his offering his soul as a sacrifice for sin.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:28.260]   He is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the whole world.
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:35.700]   And also, sixthly, this way of salvation, through Christ as a propitiation, through
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:44.540]   faith in his blood, also confirms and establishes what the law says when it tells us that without
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:51.620]   shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:56.020]   Now there are many modern popular views of the atonement that don't like the blood at
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.020]   all.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.460]   "No, they say that's an old Jewish idea.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.500]   You mustn't talk about God, his love, and God, because his love forgives sins."
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:10.220]   But God himself had said in the law, "Without shedding of blood, there is no remission of
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.100]   sins."
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.940]   Now that's God's statement in the law.
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:21.300]   And unless this way of salvation confirms that and establishes that, there is a contradiction.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.660]   But it does.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:29.740]   What I see as I look at Calvary, and as I see that mixture, that blood and water flowing
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:33.420]   from his riven side, what I see is this.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:38.660]   Without shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:45.740]   In every respect, the law is established by this view of the atonement that the apostle
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.820]   teaches here, but by none other.
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:55.580]   So that I come to my last point, my seventh point, which is this.
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:33:03.220]   It is only as we look at this atonement that we really come to have a truly spiritual conception
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.220]   of God's law.
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:11.040]   You see, apart from this, we are liable to think of the law in terms of particular actions
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.060]   and deeds and things that we do and so on.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.660]   But the law is much bigger than that.
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:21.940]   It's a spiritual thing, and its whole intent is to bring us to this place in which we shall
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:26.860]   love the Lord our God with all our heart and soul and mind and strength.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.620]   It's spiritual, and it's there I see it.
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:35.060]   It's my relationship to God, not simply my morality, not simply my behavior, no, no,
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.560]   my total relationship.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:43.820]   And as I see it, and as I see it in that way, it creates within me a desire to keep the
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.940]   law myself and to honor it.
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.500]   Very well.
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:56.540]   There are some of the ways, the chief ways, in which this way of salvation establishes,
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:02.100]   holds up the law and honors it.
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.780]   And I say again that any view of the cross that doesn't bring out these particular
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:12.980]   elements is wrong, it is false, and it is to be rejected.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:18.500]   Know that my dear friends, we really must discriminate in these matters.
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:24.420]   We mustn't allow ourselves to become sentimental and believe men who may say to us, for instance,
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:26.620]   "Ah, the message of the cross is this.
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:32.140]   There is the Son of God being crucified by men, and then he says to them from the cross,
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:36.500]   'It's all right, I still love you so much that I'm ready to forgive you for even doing
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.060]   this.'"
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.940]   Now if you begin to weep at that kind of thing and say, "That's marvelous, that's wonderful
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.860]   love," you are denying the teaching of the Apostle.
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.420]   There's no blood there.
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.580]   There's no establishing of the law.
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:55.220]   There is no explanation of all these great things that are found in the Old Testament
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:59.140]   concerning the law, and indeed in the New Testament also.
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:07.060]   So we must insist upon all these points always being made perfectly plain and clear in our
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:11.060]   understanding of the doctrine of the atonement.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:17.060]   Now God's way of salvation through Christ as a propitiation through faith in his blood
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.700]   does this.
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:28.660]   It shows the truth, the sanctity, the inviolability of God's holy law, which is an expression
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.060]   of God's character.
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:35.220]   Very well, there is the exposition.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:41.300]   And that brings us to the end of this third chapter, and especially to the end of this
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:47.140]   classical passage on the doctrine of the atonement.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:52.820]   It's a foolish thing to say, perhaps, but I was going to say that if I were asked which
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:36:00.660]   in my opinion is perhaps the most important and crucial passage in the whole of the Scriptures,
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:08.020]   I think I should have to say this, Romans 3, 21 to 31.
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:13.460]   Here is the very heart and center, and the history of the Church throughout the centuries
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.060]   shows this plainly and clearly.
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:21.300]   It is when men and women have gone wrong on this, that they've gone into heresy and have
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.300]   gone astray, and the Church has lost her power.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:31.780]   This is the message, Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:37.620]   It's the heart of the gospel, so we really cannot afford not to be certain as to its
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.620]   teaching.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:45.500]   Now, let me therefore, just in a footnote for a moment or two, just look at some of
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:51.780]   the reasons which men give today for not interpreting this in the way that I've been interpreting
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.460]   it to you.
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:59.260]   There are three things that are said commonly.
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.020]   Here's one of them.
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:06.780]   There are some who don't hesitate to say, without any apology at all, "Oh yes, they
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:12.860]   say you're quite right in your exposition of Paul's teaching, but you know," they say,
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:17.860]   "the apostle Paul, after all, was the child of his age.
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.420]   He was a Jew.
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:27.140]   He'd been trained as a Pharisee, and he was steeped in that Jewish teaching, with all
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.820]   its doctrine of blood and of sacrifice."
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:35.020]   Some would even say that the teaching didn't even come there from the Old Testament, but
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:41.020]   that the Jews had been slowly incorporating into their teaching Egyptian teaching with
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:44.660]   regard to sacrifices and offerings and things like that.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:50.980]   And they say, "Yes, your exposition is quite right, but of course it was Paul who was wrong.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.460]   He got a wrong view of God.
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.860]   He got a wrong view of salvation."
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.660]   We know, of course, they go on to say no better.
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:04.460]   We know that God is a God of love and that wrath is incompatible with love, and that
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:10.140]   the idea that God ever believed in blood sacrifices is just monstrous and ridiculous.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:15.500]   That's their explanation, that our exposition is perfectly right, but that it was Paul who
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.100]   was wrong, and therefore the whole thing is wrong.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:22.340]   Well, I don't insult you by contradicting it.
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.900]   It's unworthy of contradiction.
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.940]   If ever anybody says that to you, what you need to discuss with them is not this particular
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:29.940]   teaching.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:34.100]   You discuss with them the meaning of the term "an apostle."
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.940]   What is an apostle, ask them.
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:40.900]   Paul starts off by describing himself as a called apostle.
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.740]   The question is, what is an apostle?
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:49.620]   And if an apostle is a man who is being called by the risen Lord to receive a revelation
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:55.740]   and a commission directly and immediately from him to go out and to preach in an authoritative
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:00.420]   manner, well then we need say no more.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.860]   Everything the apostle Paul writes is correct.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:08.500]   But you see, these men set themselves and their own ideas up.
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:13.260]   They don't believe the scripture as the inspired, infallible word of God.
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.460]   And the moment you throw that overboard, well, you can make it say whatever you like.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.980]   And in other words, you are forming a gospel of your own, and indeed there's no point
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.460]   in using the Old Testament or the New.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.580]   And they're rather dishonest in using either.
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.380]   Well that's one school.
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:33.180]   But then there's another school.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.700]   And this is a little bit more dangerous because it isn't foolish enough to say the things
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:40.060]   that I've just been saying.
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:43.060]   The second school puts it like this.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:50.140]   They say, "Yes, the teaching of the apostle, of course, is absolutely right."
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.460]   Now I'm quoting a man like Dr. C.H.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:59.060]   Dodd, and I don't make any apology for mentioning the name because he's so widely read and so
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:02.900]   many regard him as authoritative in these matters.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:09.060]   He's got an exposition, a commentary on this epistle to the Romans, which I do not hesitate
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:15.380]   to say is controlling the understanding of the vast majority of ministers and preachers
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.340]   in this country today.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.420]   Now this is how he puts it.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:22.700]   He says, "Yes, that is the teaching of the apostle Paul."
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:33.220]   But he says, "This teaching of Paul has been misunderstood since about the second century."
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:39.540]   He says, "About the second century, certain Greek ideas came in.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:45.060]   And these Greek ideas monopolized the minds of the fathers of the church.
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:50.260]   Then he said, still worse, certain ideas of Roman law came in.
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:54.580]   Roman law and its ideas of equity and of righteousness and so on.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:59.460]   They came in as Christianity spread in the Roman Empire.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:04.260]   So the ideas of the Roman Empire began to spread into Christianity.
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:09.540]   Now he said, "The tragedy is that these Greek and Roman ideas have been controlling the
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.220]   teaching of the church right away down the centuries."
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:19.340]   He says, "You came at the time of the Protestant Reformation when," I'm quoting him verbatim,
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:25.300]   "when," he said, "there was a supposed revival of Pauline theology."
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:31.820]   A supposed revival, remember, of Pauline theology under Luther and Calvin, etc.
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.300]   It was a supposed revival.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:38.860]   But unfortunately, he said, "They didn't get rid of the Greek and the Latin and Roman
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.580]   ideas."
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:45.020]   And so, he says, "It has gone on until," until when?
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:54.980]   "Ah," he says, "we now, as the result of our recent linguistic researches into both
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:05.020]   the Hebrew and the Greek languages, have now discovered what the Apostle Paul rarely said
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:09.780]   and what the Apostle Paul rarely meant."
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:15.660]   So that you see, from about the second century to the twentieth century, all the teaching
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:22.220]   of the church on the atonement was all wrong.
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:30.380]   And it is only in this century, since these men have appeared on the scene, that at last
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:35.860]   we have rediscovered what the Apostle Paul rarely taught and rarely meant.
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:39.300]   I don't know what you feel, my friend.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:46.140]   I find it very difficult to speak in a controlled manner as I read things like that.
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:53.980]   I have but one word to use of such teaching, and that is, it is arrogant.
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:43:02.980]   That men should coolly suggest that mighty teachers of the church, like the great Saint
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:13.420]   Augustine, yes, and let me put in here Thomas Aquinas, and Luther, and Calvin, and Knox,
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:19.500]   and all the mighty Puritans, and the great evangelists of the eighteenth century, Whitefield
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:27.060]   and the Westleys, Toplady and Romaine, and all the great preachers of the last century,
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:31.660]   these men under whose ministries the gospel has spread as we know it has spread to the
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:36.820]   furthest parts of the world, the men who have led and have been used of God in the mightiest
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:45.900]   revivals of history, have all been wrong, we are told, on the very heart of the gospel.
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:53.500]   I am amazed that anybody doesn't see so clearly the arrogance and the impudence as to reject
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:59.740]   such a teaching out of hand, without even considering what it says in detail.
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:05.420]   But they say it, you see, and they have to say it, because they don't like the word
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:12.620]   "propitiation," because they don't like us to talk about the blood of Christ.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:21.140]   It is their hatred, it is the offense of the cross that causes it all and produces it all.
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:27.380]   God forbid that any of us should ever come anywhere near to believing it or accepting
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:33.140]   it, and the third and the last view which is put forward today is one that puts it like
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.140]   this.
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:37.940]   It isn't as arrogant as the last one, but it is still arrogant.
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:44.860]   It is the teaching which seems to argue like this, that we must never teach anything which
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:49.260]   is objectionable to the modern mind.
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:54.900]   And we are told that to talk about blood and about sacrifice and about wrath is objectionable
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:58.020]   to the modern mind, and therefore we are not to do it.
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.980]   It is as simple and as childish as that.
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:06.260]   But here again is very popular teaching, which is being followed by large numbers.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:10.540]   You see, the modern mind is the standard of all truth.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:14.180]   They don't stop to consider that what is modern today may be out of date in twenty
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:15.180]   years.
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:19.860]   They are already having to confess that things about which they were absolutely certain,
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:24.660]   their assured results of fifty years ago, they are now admitting were mistakes.
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.820]   And yet, you see, still we are told the modern mind must determine.
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.420]   It may be entirely different in fifty years.
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:36.060]   And this modern mind, which is so delicate that it can't abide talk about blood and about
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:42.660]   propitiation, but which can make atomic and hydrogen bombs, what a standard!
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:51.100]   No, no, my friends, these matters are not determined by the scrupulosity of the modern
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.100]   mind.
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:55.300]   Thank God we must go back to authority.
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:46:02.300]   And the authority is to be found in an apostle, a called apostle of God, the man who was apprehended
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:06.860]   on the road to Damascus, and who says that the gospel that he preached was not given
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:13.980]   to him by men, neither was he taught it by men, but by the revelation of God, and who
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:19.740]   doesn't hesitate to say, "Though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:26.740]   than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:31.460]   Let the moderns, in their arrogance, believe what they will.
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:37.420]   There is no gospel apart from Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:43.940]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, set forth as a propitiation through faith in his blood,
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:52.060]   God visiting upon him the punishment of our sins, God making him to be sin for us who
[00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:57.660]   knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:02.540]   I say this other teaching is not only wrong, the Holy Spirit will not honor it, he doesn't
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.740]   honor it.
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:06.220]   No one is ever converted by such preaching.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:09.780]   You will never get revival as a result of such preaching.
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.500]   Dismiss it, my friends.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.860]   Have nothing to do with it.
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:27.420]   Hold fast and firmly to this gospel of redemption, of ransoming by the blood of Christ that has
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:34.980]   thus been preached throughout the centuries and has ever been honored by God the Holy
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:45.380]   Ghost, not only in the conversion of individuals but also in the great revivals in the history
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.380]   of the Church.
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:54.380]   I say at all costs, whatever it may mean, we must hold on to this propitiation through
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:55.960]   faith in his blood.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.420]   Let us be left alone.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.040]   Let us be ostracized.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:04.800]   Let us be dismissed as fools by men with their supposed learning and their academic knowledge
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.660]   and their recent discoveries.
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:11.740]   Let them say what they will.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:16.420]   There is only one gospel of the glorious God.
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.540]   It is this.
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:20.680]   This alone saves.
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.820]   This alone justifies.
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:26.740]   Thank God for it.
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.020]   Let us pray.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:32.940]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
