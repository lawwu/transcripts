[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.960]   I will do one more question here.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.320]   This one's from Alexander, who asks,
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.040]   "How does a digital minimalist find interesting books to read?"
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.000]   Well, my advice here is don't overthink it.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.360]   Books are interesting just by definition.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.800]   It's someone who has thought a lot about something,
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.440]   be it a fictional world or an idea or a period of history or event,
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.280]   and they have put a lot of effort into getting their thoughts on the paper.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.120]   Just read. Don't overthink what you read.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.800]   You're more likely to do more reading if you
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.800]   don't care so much about what it is exactly that you're reading.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.360]   Go back and listen at the beginning of this episode or from last month or the month
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.120]   before the segments I do on the books I read each month,
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.760]   and you will see it is all over the place.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.000]   I'm not trying to impress anyone.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.120]   I'm not trying to rigorously expand my knowledge of some niche area.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.760]   I just wander all over the place.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.120]   I've been obsessed recently with Hollywood figures.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.040]   Why not? Let's read a bunch of books about that.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.360]   I'll read random fiction.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.600]   I'll throw in straight up self-help,
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.680]   but then I'll mix that in with essay collections and journalistic non-fiction.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.840]   I don't care. I grab stuff.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.400]   I finish, like I need a new book, I grab stuff.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.920]   I don't overthink it. You shouldn't overthink it either.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.320]   Reading is like calisthenics for your ability to understand and think about the world.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.920]   Don't sweat exactly what grip you're using on this metaphorical pull-up bar.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.840]   Just get on that bar most days and do some exercising.
