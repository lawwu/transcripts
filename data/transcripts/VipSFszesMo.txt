[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.480]   All right, let's do one more question about deep work here.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.320]   This last one comes from Noah.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.920]   Noah says, how do I limit activities
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.560]   that aren't important for the long term at a new job?
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.240]   So he goes on to explain about how in his past job,
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.920]   he was a chemical testing engineer
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.840]   at a pharmaceutical company.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.480]   They're very a world without email style in their approach
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.000]   to work.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.800]   They had unified task boards to see who was working on what.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.480]   Do you have a free slot for this?
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.040]   They prioritize the primary value producing activity,
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.000]   which for them was actually performing lab tests
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.560]   on chemicals.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.640]   This is all that matters.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.920]   You've got to make sure you're doing that.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.040]   Everything else is about what you
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.080]   do with the time that remains.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.440]   Pull things off this task board as you have free time.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.960]   Fantastic setup.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.840]   He says now he's a grad student in chemistry
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.000]   and it's not so organized.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.120]   And in particular, he's working on doing--
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.240]   he's a teaching assistant.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.880]   It says things just get thrown at him.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.040]   And he feels like he can't ignore them
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.640]   because it's part of his job, but it's haphazard and out
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.480]   of control.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.240]   And it's getting in his way of doing the main work.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.680]   So what should he do about it?
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.120]   Well, who is this?
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.640]   Noah?
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.680]   Noah, yes.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.120]   Professor types are, in general, quite disorganized.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.480]   They will just throw stuff at you because their whole life
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.080]   is chaotic.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.040]   And they just need to get it out of their brain
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.440]   is exploding with all these different demands
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.720]   they're placing on it.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.480]   And you can't just ignore it.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.440]   But what you can do, in most cases as a teaching assistant,
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.000]   is take control of the processes.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.280]   Professor doesn't care.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.600]   They just don't want to have to worry about these things.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.400]   So if you say, here's how I'm working with the students.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.240]   Here's how I think we should work with this.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.240]   Here is the different processes to get the problem sets in,
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.160]   to get them graded, to get notes back, to get whatever.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.720]   Come up with processes that are much more structured, much
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.600]   less haphazard, and just implement them on your own,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.320]   and talk them through with your professor,
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.480]   and say, here's some ideas I have.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.360]   I think we should run it this way.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.640]   It's going to keep it simpler for you,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.440]   and it's going to be more controlled.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.440]   9 out of 10 professors are like, whatever.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.000]   That one sentence you just told me
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.600]   has already taken up more time than I have available.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.120]   Just whatever.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.080]   Whatever we need to do.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.760]   They don't care.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.680]   So leverage the fact they're too busy and hairy
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.600]   to now to control the care to shape the job.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   That's my main advice for teaching assistants,
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.440]   is that you have more control here
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.600]   than you think about how you want your job to unfold.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.680]   The professors don't care.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.160]   They're happy for you to take the reins
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.560]   and make this more structured.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.320]   They're not going to do it because they're
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.080]   terrible at this stuff.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.640]   They weren't terrible at this stuff.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.800]   They probably would have left academia
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   and made a lot of money anyway.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.560]   So OK.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.080]   I'm going to get yelled at now by professors
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.880]   and Zettelkasten people.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.280]   Great.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.440]   But this is what I would say.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.920]   I remember-- I vividly remember having this revelation
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.480]   as a graduate student.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.960]   I was TAing-- didn't do a ton of TAing at MIT,
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.120]   but I TAed a few courses, distributed algorithms
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.800]   with my advisor.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.720]   I also TAed a security course with Ron Rivest,
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.000]   who is the R in RSA.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.920]   He invented RSA, public key encryption.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.880]   That was interesting.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.040]   And I remember at some point in one of these TAing,
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.440]   I think that when I was TAing first for my advisor,
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.320]   just having this insight of like,
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.440]   this is kind of haphazard how we're doing this.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.600]   And there's a lot of structure we could bring to this
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.520]   that would have basically zero impact on the students
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.080]   or the advisor.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.240]   It's not going to make their life harder.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.880]   They don't care.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.040]   The professor doesn't care.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.360]   But it's going to make my life significantly easier.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.040]   Like, oh, if I do it this way, it's
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.440]   going to make life much easier.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.800]   Just no one's thinking about it because no one cares,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.360]   because it doesn't directly affect them.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.320]   And I remember I really began to structure,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.800]   here's our systems for how you hand in problem sets,
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.400]   and how we grade them, and how we hand things back.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   And it made a big difference.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.000]   I don't remember all the details here,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.760]   but I vaguely remember that it was just
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.680]   like a casual idea my advisor had,
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.280]   which made sense on paper, which was,
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.840]   we should Xerox copy the problem set submissions.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.040]   So that if we lose one, we have a copy.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.240]   And because I guess it happened like once.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.280]   We lost the problem set.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.700]   We're like, ah, we can't grade it.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.480]   But if we have a copy backup, that would help.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.200]   It sounds good on paper.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   It's impossibly time consuming, because these are all
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.160]   coming in in different types of papers.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.320]   They're mainly stapled.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.080]   They're mainly stapled, so it's impossible to-- you
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.360]   have to take staples out.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.560]   And it was hours just Xeroxing these things.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.100]   And I think at some point-- and again,
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.520]   I don't remember the exact details,
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.160]   but I just remember thinking, how often does this happen?
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.080]   It happened once four years ago.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.400]   Let's just-- we'll give you all the points if we lose it.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.440]   And we're going to save ourselves all this time.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.960]   And it costs no time.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.920]   I made that case.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.760]   She was like, fine, that sounds fine.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.960]   But I was just thinking through, what can we do here?
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.080]   I also remember-- and again, I don't have the details here,
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.240]   Noah, so I'm sorry I don't have more specifics.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.320]   But I also remember realizing at some point,
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.160]   the big class and lots of problem sets
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.240]   when we had graders and everything,
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.480]   having the students alphabetize when they hand it in
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.480]   made a big difference.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.160]   So OK, here's the stack.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160]   When you come up to hand your problem set,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.600]   find where your name actually is in alphabetical order
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   and put it there.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.720]   10 extra seconds when you submit it
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.840]   saves a huge amount of time for us on the back end.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.600]   It made it much easier for us to split it up.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.060]   Other things I remember figuring out
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.000]   is dealing with the undergraduate graders,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.440]   is just automating some of the process.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.240]   These come to me already in alphabetical order.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.840]   I just put them in a mail sorter outside of my office.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.360]   I split them in half in the middle of the names or whatever.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.600]   And you come and grab them.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.000]   And there's stuff I told the students about format,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.540]   like make sure that they're in this format, which again, had
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.720]   little impact on the students.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.240]   It was very easier than the change to format.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.000]   Just like, what do you want me to do?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.560]   Fine.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.940]   But it made a huge difference in how
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.040]   we could consistently grade it.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.960]   So these type of things made a big difference.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.920]   So know how to do that.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.720]   Put in place your own processes, and people will be fine with it.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.460]   And more generally, even if you're not a teaching
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.720]   assistant, there's a teachable moment here,
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.840]   which is add processes.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.680]   Even if the work is coming from someone else,
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.840]   people often don't care.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.600]   They're too busy.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.580]   All right, so that's it for questions about deep work.
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.900]   We're running a little long here,
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.900]   but let's put in a few questions here, as always,
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.380]   about the deep life.
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
