[00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.680]   I have something that I want to talk to you about.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.280]   Change the subject for a moment.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.320]   That is on my heart, and it's very, very important to me, and I need your help with this.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:26.000]   So we're watching a culture that is under divine judgment, and you can think about that
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.320]   in terms of a culture, or you can realize that the people who defy God in the culture
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.260]   are under divine judgment.
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.240]   It's very personal.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.820]   And it struck me this week in a way that it hadn't in the past.
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.240]   Governor Gavin Newsom, who has decided that he is going to lead the nation in providing
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.980]   the slaughter of the children that God creates in the womb.
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:06.680]   He has postured himself as if he were Herod, and I am deeply concerned for the jeopardy
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.260]   of his eternal soul.
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:19.920]   I have talked to him in the past, and I know he was raised in the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.960]   But a line was crossed this week that really, really gripped my heart.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:36.660]   He began putting up billboards all across America, advertising the website in California
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.860]   that you can connect to if you want to have an abortion.
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:54.380]   And on all those billboards, he included the words of Jesus, "Billboards advertising abortion."
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.940]   This is what he put on those billboards.
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.600]   "Billboards."
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.460]   Jesus said in Mark 12:31, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.360]   There is no other commandment greater than these."
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.180]   He had the terrifying audacity to use the words of Jesus to support the slaughter of
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.260]   the ones that He creates in the womb.
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.920]   The jeopardy of his soul is evident.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:35.140]   I say this because my heart is grieved that Christ should be so dishonored.
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:44.340]   Billboards across the country with the words of Jesus trying to support abortion, terrifying.
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:55.900]   My concern is about His eternal soul, because He will meet His Maker.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:04.120]   And there's a passage in Psalm 50.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   Listen to it.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:16.820]   Verse 16, "But to the wicked God says, 'What right have you to tell of My statutes and
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.900]   take My covenant in your mouth?'"
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.900]   What a statement.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.880]   Let me read it again.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:33.760]   Verse 17, "But to the wicked God says, 'What right have you to tell of My statutes and
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.420]   take My covenant in your mouth?'"
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:48.780]   You cast My words behind you.
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.860]   Then God says in Psalm 50, "Now consider this, I will tear you in pieces.
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.520]   And there will be none to deliver you."
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.080]   The jeopardy is clear.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.900]   But there is a closing verse in that Psalm.
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.580]   "He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me.
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:25.840]   And to him who orders his way aright, I shall show the salvation of God."
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:34.580]   The Psalm ends with mercy and the offer of salvation.
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:42.940]   And as the church of Jesus Christ, with compassion, we want the governor and all who follow him
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:51.300]   and all who reject the Lord to know that no matter what they have done, He offers salvation.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.680]   He offers salvation.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.820]   I think with a new kind of salvation, we're going to be able to see the Lord's face.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.380]   But with a new kind of resolve, I want to ask you to begin to pray for the salvation
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.680]   of the governor and the people around him.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.000]   We can't do anything else.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.060]   There's no political solutions to anything.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:21.200]   We can cry out to the Lord to be merciful because we care.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.800]   This is why the church is in the world.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.080]   This is why the church is in the world.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.720]   And that He would understand what He has done, that He would turn from sin.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.100]   He would repent along with those who accommodate that, follow that, and cry out for mercy from
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.520]   God who will grant it through Jesus Christ.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.520]   Amen?
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.520]   Amen.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:54.540]   Father, we thank You for Your truth, and we boldly proclaim it like those who were filled
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.780]   with the Spirit in Acts 4:30.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:03.600]   It says there that they were filled with the Spirit and boldly proclaimed the Word.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.720]   We proclaim it boldly from the housetop to all.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:14.020]   And You have told us in particular to pray for the salvation of rulers and leaders.
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.200]   And so we boldly proclaim the truth of Christ.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.760]   This is our calling in the world, and ask that You would be gracious to us.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.760]   We pray that You would be gracious to us.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.760]   We pray that You would be gracious to us.
