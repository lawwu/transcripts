[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.900]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.320]   - I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.600]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.400]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.040]   My guest today is Dr. Diego Borges.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.600]   Dr. Diego Borges is a professor of medicine
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.880]   and neurobiology at Duke University.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.520]   He did his training in gastrointestinal physiology
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.960]   and nutrition and later neuroscience.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.680]   And by combining that unique training and expertise,
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.160]   he is considered a pioneer and leader
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.600]   in so-called gut sensing or the gut-brain axis.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.160]   Now, when most people hear the words gut-brain axis,
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.880]   they immediately think of the so-called microbiome,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.280]   which is extremely important,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.600]   but that is not the topic of Dr. Borges' expertise.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.600]   Dr. Borges focuses on the actual sensing
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.260]   that occurs within one's gut,
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.640]   just as one would sense light with their eyes
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.240]   or sound waves with their ears for hearing.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.880]   Our gut contains receptors
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.080]   that respond to specific components of food,
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.560]   including amino acids, fats, sugars,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.880]   and other aspects of food, including temperature,
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.560]   acidity, and other micronutrients that are contained in food
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.800]   that give our gut the clear picture
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.280]   of what is happening at the level of the types
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.120]   and qualities of food that we ingest,
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.920]   and then communicate that below our conscious detection
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.840]   to our brain in order to drive specific patterns
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.680]   of thinking, emotion, and behavior.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.680]   And of course, everybody has heard of our so-called gut sense
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.920]   or our ability to believe or feel certain things
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.560]   based on perceptions that are below
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.520]   or somehow different from conventional language.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.160]   Today, Dr. Borges teaches us
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.280]   about all aspects of gut sensing,
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.640]   how it occurs at the level of specific neurons
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.160]   and neural circuits, how the brain responds to that,
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.920]   how specific foods and components of food impact
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.880]   not just our feeling of digestion
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.960]   or feeling good or bad about what we ate,
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.960]   but indeed how we feel overall, how safe we feel,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.760]   how excited we feel, whether or not we feel depressed
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.080]   or sad, angry, or happy.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.520]   Today's discussion, I promise you, is unique
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.360]   among all discussions of neuroscience,
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.040]   at least that I've heard previously,
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.720]   in that it combines two seemingly disparate fields,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.160]   nutrition and neuroscience.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.960]   Indeed, today's discussion gets into how different foods
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.360]   and food combinations impact how we feel
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.820]   and what we crave and what we tend to avoid.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.860]   We also get to hear the absolutely extraordinary story
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.960]   of Dr. Borges' upbringing in the Amazon jungle
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.600]   and how his knowledge and intuition about plants
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.200]   has influenced his science
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.040]   and how the incredible science that his laboratory is doing
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.480]   relates to all of us and our ability
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.180]   to better tap into our gut sense.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.920]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.560]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.620]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.280]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.000]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.240]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.120]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.120]   Our first sponsor is Juve.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.320]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.160]   Now, if there's one thing
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.640]   that I've consistently emphasized on this podcast,
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.800]   it's the incredible impact that light, meaning photons,
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.360]   can have on our mental health and physical health.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.560]   Red and near-infrared light has been shown
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.160]   to have profound effects on improving cellular health,
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.200]   which can help with faster muscle recovery,
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.120]   boosting healthier skin, reducing pain and inflammation,
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.120]   enhancing sleep, and much more.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.720]   What sets Juve apart is that it uses
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.600]   clinically effective wavelengths,
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.340]   emits a safe and effective dose
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.080]   of red and near-infrared light,
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.240]   and most importantly,
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.640]   offers the only true medical grade red light panel available.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.600]   I personally try to use the handheld Juve Go unit,
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.040]   as it's called, every day,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.140]   and especially when I'm on the road traveling.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.180]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.820]   you can go to juve.com/huberman.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.160]   That's J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.920]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.840]   to Huberman Lab Podcast listeners
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.200]   with up to $400 off Juve products.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.400]   Again, that's juve.com/huberman.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.040]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.360]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.680]   that has everything you need.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.760]   That means the electrolytes,
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.400]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.280]   in the correct amounts and ratios,
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.600]   and nothing you don't, which means no sugar.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.320]   Now, I and others on this podcast
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.640]   have talked about the critical importance of hydration
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.200]   for proper brain and body functioning.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.120]   Even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.640]   can diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.940]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes.
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.920]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.120]   are critical for the functioning
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.600]   of all the cells in your body,
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.680]   especially your neurons, your nerve cells.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.160]   Drinking Element dissolved in water
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.500]   makes it very easy to ensure
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.280]   that you're getting adequate hydration
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.880]   and adequate electrolytes.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.360]   To make sure I'm getting proper amounts
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.080]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.920]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.160]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.660]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.760]   I'll also drink Element dissolved in water
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.680]   during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.040]   especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot,
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.080]   losing water and electrolytes.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.000]   They have a bunch of different
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.680]   great-tasting flavors of Element.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.240]   My favorite is the watermelon,
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.800]   although I confess I also like the raspberry and the citrus.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.840]   Basically, I like all the flavors.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.300]   And Element has also just released
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.380]   a new line of canned sparkling Element.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.120]   So these aren't the packets you dissolve in water.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.480]   These are cans of Element that you crack open
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.820]   like any other canned drink, like a soda,
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.120]   but you're getting your hydration
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.040]   and your electrolytes with no sugar.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.160]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.040]   you can go to drinkelement, spelled L-M-N-T.com/huberman
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.680]   to claim a free Element sample pack
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.520]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.560]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.320]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.360]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.480]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.740]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.080]   Now, I've spoken many times before
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.120]   on this and other podcasts about the fact
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.560]   that getting a great night's sleep
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.120]   is the foundation of mental health,
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.700]   physical health, and performance.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.160]   When we aren't doing that on a consistent basis,
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.240]   everything suffers.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.260]   And when we are sleeping well and enough,
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.440]   our mental health, physical health,
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.400]   and performance in all endeavors improves markedly.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.920]   Helix mattresses are different
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.680]   in that they are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.200]   So if you go to the Helix website,
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.960]   you take a brief two-minute quiz,
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.680]   and it asks you questions such as,
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.560]   do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.620]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.460]   Things of that sort.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.760]   Maybe you know the answers to those questions,
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.740]   maybe you don't.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.400]   Either way, Helix will match you
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.320]   to the ideal mattress for you.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.460]   For me, that turned out to be the Dusk mattress.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.960]   I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.400]   about three and a half years ago,
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.200]   and it's been far and away the best sleep that I've ever had
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.540]   because it's customized to my unique sleep needs.
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.680]   So if you go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.280]   and take that brief two-minute quiz,
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.260]   you can figure out what mattress is ideal
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.000]   for your unique sleep needs.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.960]   For the remainder of this month, May 2024,
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.520]   Helix is giving up to 30% off mattresses
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.380]   and two free pillows as part of their Memorial Day offer.
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.420]   Simply go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.140]   to get 30% off and two free pillows.
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.500]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Diego Borges.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.020]   Dr. Diego Borges, great to have you here.
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.740]   - Thank you for having me, Andrew.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.340]   - I am super excited to learn from you today,
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.260]   as I know everyone else is.
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.780]   And if they don't realize why, soon they will,
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.140]   which is that you work on one of the more fascinating aspects
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.140]   of us, which is our gut, our gut sensing,
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.540]   the gut brain axis,
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.940]   which I think most people don't realize is nearby,
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.960]   but separate from the so-called microbiome.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.020]   So we're not talking about the microbiome,
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.120]   a very interesting and important topic, of course,
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.580]   but we are going to talk about this thing
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.140]   that we call our gut sense
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.320]   and how it impacts everything from our cravings
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.100]   to our brain health and our cognition.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.180]   So once again, welcome.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.580]   And I just want to kick things off by asking you
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.580]   to educate us, explain, you know,
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.880]   what is this gut brain axis that we hear about
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.920]   and what's going on in our gut besides digestion?
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:06.220]   - Well, Andrew, thank you so much for having me here.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.260]   Thrilled to be here.
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.860]   I knew that since we met a few years ago
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.460]   that we will have this ongoing conversation
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.720]   and a great conversation.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.340]   The gut and the brain, you know,
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.980]   people call it an axis because traditionally
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.260]   it's thought to be an imaginary line
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.760]   that was connected through hormones.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.020]   So since 1902, when the first hormone secreting
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:36.020]   was reported by Bayleys and Stout,
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:41.020]   and it was known that when we eat,
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:47.420]   then hormones, these molecules in the gut are released
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.240]   and then they will enter the bloodstream
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.000]   and then eventually will have a cause in distant organs.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.100]   And for the next hundred or so years,
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.660]   the field focused on the hormones.
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.380]   And as a consequence, there was no direct line
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.180]   of communication between the gut and the brain.
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.220]   But as often I say, you don't, you don't say,
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.620]   or we don't say the nose brain axis, right?
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.880]   Like, or the eye brain axis, right?
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.700]   And all of the organs are in sync, working in sync.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.700]   So in the gut, there are also some sensory cells
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.900]   that are able to detect the outside world
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:33.380]   and then quickly communicate that information to the brain.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.680]   And I say the outside world,
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.380]   because the gut is the only organ
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.700]   that passes throughout our body,
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.140]   but it is still exposed to the outside.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.260]   If you think about it, if you will swallow a marble,
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.380]   it still has a chance to get out.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.360]   - Please don't do that anybody.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.180]   - But it is still exposed to the surface.
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.820]   - You're right, I never thought about the gut
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.500]   as the organ that is in contact with the outside world.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.800]   Unlike our heart, which is not in direct contact
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.500]   with the outside world, or our liver, our pancreas,
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.660]   but the gut is.
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.740]   - The gut is, and if you think about it,
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:15.940]   it is just separated by some compartments
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.140]   that have all of these valves.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.140]   And the epiglottis, the gastroesophageal junction,
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:28.420]   the pylorus, the ileocecal junction, the rectum.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.820]   - So these are the sequences of valves,
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.620]   of chambers with valves between them
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.660]   that food passes through, air passes through.
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.740]   And within each, as I understand it,
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.620]   there are different functions related to digestion.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.660]   But I think where you're taking us is that
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.140]   there are different modes of sensing what's coming through
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.860]   and signaling to the brain and other organs
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.380]   what's going on in the outside world
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.740]   by what's sensed coming through that passage.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.580]   Is that correct?
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.120]   - That's correct, and if we think about it,
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:04.060]   the, when we swallow something,
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.740]   literally we have to trust our gut.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.620]   Perhaps that's why we use this phrase, trust your gut.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.620]   Because after that, there's not much that you can do,
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.540]   at least in regular humans, that you can do consciously
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:22.540]   to expel something that perhaps is poisonous or toxic.
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.940]   It is the gut that has to make that distinction.
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.100]   And then usually accommodate things for absorption,
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.460]   or let them pass through digestion,
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.420]   and then ultimately they will be secreted, right?
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.420]   - So if you could describe for us the architecture
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.940]   that is the cells that respond to things in the gut
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.340]   and where they send that information
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.100]   and how they send that information.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.220]   What is this thing that we call gut sensing made up of?
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.800]   What's the parts list?
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.240]   - So the parts list has been evolving recently.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.080]   And while some of the elements we have known for a while,
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.240]   but in general, what we're talking about,
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.400]   because it's an external surface,
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.960]   it is lined by a single layer of cells
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.640]   that are called epithelial cells.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.640]   And essentially these cells are exposed
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.200]   to the outside world,
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.760]   but they also are like attached in like a little membrane.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.200]   And they are the ones that interface
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.120]   with the inside of the body.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.860]   So in the stomach, we have a stratified epithelium,
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.960]   for instance, that is thicker,
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.840]   so it can survive digestion, chemicals,
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.880]   and other things like harsh environment.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.720]   And in the intestine,
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.720]   we have a little bit more delicate epithelial layer.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.760]   And within this epithelial layer,
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.040]   there are several different cell types.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.240]   And one of those is the so-called enteroendocrine cell.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.960]   To put it in more simple terms,
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.680]   is a gut endocrine cell,
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.480]   or a gut cell that releases hormones.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:04.480]   The term was coined in 1938 by a German physician.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.840]   His name was Friedrich Feter.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:11.280]   And at that time, it was a major advancement
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.960]   in our understanding of physiology,
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.360]   because he came up with the idea
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.220]   that the organs were not only communicating to organs.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.520]   In fact, there were cells within the organs
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.600]   that were communicating to other organs
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.120]   through the release of some of these endocrine factors,
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.360]   these neuromodulators,
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.000]   or these neuropeptides that we know as hormones.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.160]   And so he named the diffuse endocrine system of the gut,
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.000]   and then he came up with this word enteroendocrine cell.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.960]   And these cells are dispersed
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.760]   at a ratio of roughly speaking,
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.480]   like one to 1,000 epithelial cells
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.300]   throughout the digestive tract.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.360]   And we thought for the longest time
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.160]   that these cells were not connecting directly
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.080]   to the nervous system,
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.120]   that they will release these neuromodulators,
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.360]   and the neuromodulators through diffusion
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.400]   will act on receptors into some of the nerve terminals.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.240]   And that is true.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.880]   That is a very well-established system.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.240]   But in 2015, we made an observation
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.800]   that some of these cells,
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.360]   anywhere from 1/3 to 2/3 of these cells,
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.320]   it depends on the type of systems
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.960]   that you use to identify it,
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.320]   they were contacting directly the nervous system.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.200]   And that brought up a new dimension
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.640]   of how it is that the gut could be communicating
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.000]   to the brain, because as you know,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.680]   in the brain, the synapses are the ones
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.600]   that are most predominant.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.880]   However, there is a lot of neuromodulation
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.800]   from endocrine functions in the brain too.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.200]   So in the gut, this was not well-described.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.320]   There had been historically a few examples
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.920]   that these cells may be making synaptic contacts,
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.960]   but they had not been studied.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.920]   And perhaps one of the main reasons
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.160]   why they hadn't been studied
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.720]   is because the tools were not there.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.120]   And if you recall, in the 1990s,
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.400]   with the advancement of green fluorescence protein
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.400]   as one of the main molecules to tag cells,
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.880]   now all of a sudden, there was a revolution in biology
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.360]   because you could identify the cells,
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.280]   you can take them out,
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.800]   you can do a transcriptomic analysis
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.080]   to see what genes they express,
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.400]   you could co-culture them, you can modify their genome,
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.920]   and then you can start to interrogate
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.560]   what is their contribution to the entire body.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.760]   - I'll just interrupt you for a second
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.600]   just to make sure that I and everyone else is on board.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.080]   So if I understand correctly,
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.260]   it's long been known that there are cells
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.800]   that are in these layers of the gut and the intestine,
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.840]   and it's long been appreciated that as food passes through,
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.640]   these cells somehow can sense the chemical constituents
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.120]   of the food as it gets broken down,
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.200]   and then release hormones into the bloodstream
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.960]   that could influence the brain,
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.240]   those hormones could travel and influence things far away.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.440]   In fact, for those that don't know,
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.680]   endocrine generally means signaling
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.440]   at a distance between cells.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.720]   So between gut and brain or gut and liver,
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.120]   it can also mean local effects.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.960]   So hormones, endocrine effects can also be local.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.040]   But if I also understand you correctly,
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.400]   it was only about 15 years ago
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.840]   when you mentioned green fluorescent protein,
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.280]   we should probably just tell the tale in a few sentences.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.420]   This is an amazing story in biology,
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.400]   where if you've ever seen fluorescing jellyfish,
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.040]   that's because they express a gene
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.120]   for so-called green fluorescent protein,
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.620]   and biologists have hijacked that gene sequence
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.520]   and put it into mice,
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.240]   and now actually other organisms as well,
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.120]   which allows you to see individual cells and cell types.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.160]   So these cells release hormones,
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.800]   the hormones influence the brain and other organs,
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.040]   and now I think you're gonna tell us
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.800]   that they also are able to make direct communication lines
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.580]   with other organs as well.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.420]   - Correct.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.400]   So maybe here is feeling how it is
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.640]   that I got into studying the system.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:07.540]   And as you know, between the '90s and the early 2000s,
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.480]   there was an explosion in tools to study the brain
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.320]   and neural circuitry and the connection of neurons
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.360]   and each one of the neurons.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.640]   Because up until the 1990s,
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.740]   the tools were limited, electrophysiology, behavior.
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:27.000]   But then not only we had green fluorescent protein,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.200]   we had optogenetics,
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   we had a rabies modified to be able to trace
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:39.000]   and how it is that neurons connect at one synapse,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.480]   which was a dream.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.120]   I think that in fact, that was the dream of Francis Crick.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.320]   When he was at Salk,
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.640]   he talked about having the way to control.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.460]   - For those that don't know,
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.320]   Crick was a co-recipient to the Nobel Prize
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.160]   for the discovery of the structured DNA,
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.140]   but then later in his career,
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.120]   developed an obsession for neuroscience.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:00.260]   And yeah, he daydreamed out loud about having tools
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.960]   to visualize individual connections in the nervous system.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.600]   And as Diego is pointing out,
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.320]   scientists have hijacked the rabies virus,
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.000]   which hops between neurons,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.680]   labeled the rabies virus with things that glow fluorescent.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.800]   And in doing so,
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.080]   we now understand a lot about what Crick dreamed for,
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.280]   which was the ability to see
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.200]   different specific connections in the nervous system.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.040]   - Yes.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.160]   So then you could isolate the cells
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.120]   and then you could do sequencing technology
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.480]   to see like what are the genes
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.160]   that these cells are expressing.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.880]   And then you can start to understand
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.420]   the makeup of the cells.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.420]   In 2009, Hans Clevers, a scientist in the Netherlands,
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.240]   did a beautiful experiment.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.600]   Like he discovered these factors
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.040]   that will trigger a receptor of the stem cells
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.280]   in the intestinal epithelium
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.360]   and will form literally a mini gut in a dish.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.600]   You know, these cells will be all lined up
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.640]   and then they will have a lumen.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.880]   And I remember like seeing some of these papers coming out
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.240]   when I was a PhD student and I was already studying the gut.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.880]   So it was inspiring to see like all of the things
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.880]   that all of a sudden you could do, right?
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.580]   So when I began studying the cells,
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.220]   immediately by isolating the cells
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:22.220]   and simply observing the cells in the native tissue
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.620]   of these mice models,
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.140]   it quickly became evident that some of the cells
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.220]   had a very peculiar anatomy.
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.660]   Some of them had these very prominent arms at the base,
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.580]   like literally like in the Sistine Chapel,
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.460]   Adam reaching out to God, right?
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.380]   Like with a hand.
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:48.540]   These cells will have that type of anatomical features
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.980]   and even ending with a little hand at the end of the arm.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.100]   And obviously I immediately thought like,
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:01.100]   why would a cell that it is supposed to react to food
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.740]   and release hormones into the bloodstream
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.700]   or just in the vicinity will invest so much energy
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.360]   into developing an arm, right?
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.860]   So then I started to look, well,
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.860]   perhaps it is because it's providing a bridge
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.240]   directly into the vasculature, into the vessels
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.360]   to put the hormones into the bloodstream, right?
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.340]   Grown, like I couldn't find that direct connection.
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.980]   So then I started to study,
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.820]   perhaps they were associated with the nervous system
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.100]   and that's how we made some of the first observations
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:38.100]   that some of them with the arm or without the arm,
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.380]   they will have a more intimate relationship
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.100]   with nerve fibers.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:49.100]   And that of course, open up a bunch of new questions.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:53.660]   But the first thing that we had to do,
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.820]   it was to come up with a name for this food.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.500]   And it kind of became organic.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.460]   And I wanna highlight these because I think that
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:05.340]   as we go through the discovery trajectory,
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.900]   we don't realize the need to also engineer language.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.140]   How we go about languages,
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.660]   we start to attach words that we already knew
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.300]   and we start to put them together to describe something
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.860]   that new that we're observing, right?
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.900]   And I say this because at the very beginning with my mentor,
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.060]   we will start to call these little feet.
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.220]   First, we call them axon,
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.500]   which is like the term for like
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.580]   the long extending branches of the neurons,
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.340]   the main branches of the neurons.
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.340]   So we will call them axon-like
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.780]   because they look like a baby axon.
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.100]   But then we call them also like pseudopod
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.620]   because it was like a pod, but it was pseudo.
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.060]   And at some point we,
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:50.100]   and it was coming from like some cells in the kidneys
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.380]   that they are called podia or something like that.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.340]   So it was axon-like, pseudopod-like basal process
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.020]   to describe that it was on the base.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.460]   So at some point it became so long
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.180]   that we couldn't fit it in an abstract, right?
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.140]   - Yeah, it's a bit of a mouthful.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.460]   - So we began thinking about it
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.380]   and then eventually I came up with the term.
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.420]   I thought like, "Ah, Neuropod."
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.980]   And I remember pitching it to my mentor
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.100]   and I said like, "Let me think about the weekend."
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.300]   And then on a Monday he came in and he said like,
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.780]   "You know, it has a ring to it.
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.460]   "I think that we should use it."
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.780]   But essentially the thought was that
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.260]   if these cells are contacting,
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.300]   then perhaps they are passing information directly
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.660]   onto the nervous system.
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.060]   And that is very different
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:38.060]   than just spewing neuromodulators in the vicinity
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:42.580]   and hoping that some of those catch the nervous system.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.740]   And like I said, while that still exists,
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.780]   and I think that is just like matter of space and time.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.700]   Like they modulate these terminals
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.260]   in a different space and time, the hormones,
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.820]   but the neurotransmission is directly
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.540]   and more precise in space and time.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.620]   - Could I just interrupt for a moment, please?
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:06.420]   So hormone signaling, endocrine signaling,
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.900]   generally is slower than the forms of communication
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.140]   directly between neurons, right?
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.260]   Could be on the order of seconds, sure,
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.380]   but typically on the orders of minutes or hours.
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:24.180]   Whereas neural communication on the order of milliseconds.
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.020]   - Correct.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.900]   - So if I understand correctly,
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.820]   these, what you decided to call neuropod cells,
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.100]   and thank you for shortening the name
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:36.620]   from the other description, line the gut.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.980]   Are we talking about everything from esophagus
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.300]   down to the stomach, to the intestine,
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.780]   or is it just at the level of the stomach and intestine?
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:47.060]   Where does it exist?
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.980]   - This is where the conversation becomes expansive
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:54.980]   because these neuropods, or cousins of these neuropods,
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.380]   so these neuropods are simply
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.300]   a specialized neuroepithelial cells,
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.020]   meaning that are electrically excitable,
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.700]   that they can discharge electricity,
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.740]   but they are, these type of cells
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.340]   are in every single epithelial cell,
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.700]   or epithelial layer of the body,
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.820]   because that's how the body creates a representation
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.380]   of the world, through sensor cells
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.980]   that are equipped to detect the outside world,
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.460]   meaning that they can be exposed
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.020]   to fluctuations in temperature,
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.740]   fluctuations in pH, fluctuations in concentrations,
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:32.420]   and then they quickly can generate a chemo-electrical code
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.220]   that they pass it on to the nervous system,
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.460]   and then ultimately the brain integrates that
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.460]   and says like, ooh, my belly's feeling good,
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.700]   but I'm feeling cold in the skin, right?
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.700]   And that is thanks to all of these neuropithelial cells
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.020]   that they are even in tasting, so to speak,
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.860]   the cerebrospinal fluid inside of the spinal cord
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.940]   and the ventricles, they are inside of the inner ears,
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.460]   the taste pads.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.660]   So it is, and in fact, there's a beautiful book
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.740]   from the '70s from some Japanese scientists,
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.220]   Fujita Kannon Kobayashi,
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.060]   who called these cells paraneurons,
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.500]   and their whole concept is that there was not
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.380]   such a discrete distinction between a neuron
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.500]   that lives inside of the brain or the central nervous system
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.220]   and a neuropithelial or a neuroendocrine cell
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.620]   that lives exposed to the outside,
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.340]   simply that there is a continuum of adaptation
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:33.540]   so the organism can bring the information from outside
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.860]   inside into the body to be able to process it
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.140]   and then process it and then guide behavior.
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.980]   - So, based on the way you describe it,
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:46.260]   we have these neuropod cells that line our gut,
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:50.340]   and we also have these similar cell types
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.300]   in the other organs of the body,
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.780]   and these cells are responding to the chemical constituents
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.860]   of what we eat as the food is broken down,
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.780]   also to the temperature of the environment,
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:06.780]   to the pH, that is how relatively basic or acidic
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.120]   something is that we ate,
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.300]   and presumably to other features
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.160]   in our environment as well,
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.660]   and all of that information is activating these cells
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.080]   to some degree or another,
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.600]   and then we're releasing hormones
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.360]   into our body as a consequence,
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.900]   but also there's a direct line to the brain,
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:30.000]   and we're not necessarily aware of all of this happening,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.320]   right, I mean, until you describe it,
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.380]   I think most of us have not been aware
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.480]   that this is happening.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.040]   - And we probably shouldn't be aware,
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.160]   you know, like as I often say,
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.360]   if you and I are having a conversation,
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.680]   we probably shouldn't be aware of the macrophage
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.600]   in the spleen that is chasing this bacterium
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.120]   that got inside of the lettuce
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.080]   that we swallowed at lunch, right,
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.260]   like you just do your thing
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.520]   so we can keep communicating, right?
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.560]   - Except maybe you don't eat more of that lettuce, right,
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.600]   which is the-- - That's right.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.000]   - Okay, so you discovered these neuropod cells.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.440]   - That's right. - And you--
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.600]   - Or I described them, yeah. - You described them, yeah.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.960]   And you had in hand some tools to selectively label them.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.720]   What did that reveal about their connectivity with,
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.280]   you're referring to it as the nervous system,
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.120]   which I love because a resounding theme on this podcast
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.000]   is I always say, you know, brain and spinal cord
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.640]   and all the connections to the body and back again
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.960]   is the nervous system, but what did you discover
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.080]   in terms of the connections with the brain proper?
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.560]   - Here is where the tools started to make a big difference.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.240]   You know, all of a sudden you could see
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.080]   the resolution of a receptor inside of a cell
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.720]   using certain type of microscopes, right?
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.160]   So I remember that one of the first questions
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.160]   that I will always get, drill on,
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:47.000]   you know how these laugh meetings can get intense, right,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.200]   like when I would bring data
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.000]   and showing just very simple immunohistochemistry,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.800]   meaning labeling, to see how the cells were interacting
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.280]   with the nervous system.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.880]   As an eye will show some of the images,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.800]   then the other scientists will say,
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.240]   well, you know, yeah, those are nice images,
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:10.240]   but remember that contact does not mean connection.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.720]   And then I went thinking about that,
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.640]   like at the very beginning,
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.080]   I thought that it was silly semantics, you know,
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.640]   but I specifically remember that there was one time
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.640]   I was running and I was thinking like,
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.600]   how do you demonstrate connection between two cells?
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.400]   And then I thought that since we had the ability
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.360]   to identify these cells by fluorescence,
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.240]   we could isolate them based on their fluorescence.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.880]   And what will happen if we put them
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.840]   in front of a sensory neuron
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.880]   and then just record them inside of a microscope, right,
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.720]   over time.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.000]   And I thought maybe they will get close to each other
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.160]   and then we can go and do some more labeling
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.720]   and show that they are contacting or connecting.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.960]   But much to our surprise,
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.120]   we actually saw that in real time,
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.560]   when you isolate them from the mouse
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.520]   and you put them in a dish,
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.720]   they both look like these round circles.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.920]   But after a few hours,
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.560]   not only they get close to each other,
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.920]   but they recapitulate the circuitry in the dish.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.600]   Literally they form like two brains in a dish, right?
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.160]   Like it's the gut and the brain in a dish.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.400]   Yeah, and that was an eye opener.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.840]   I still remember it was somewhere,
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.280]   I think it was like June 27, 2012,
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.360]   when I saw that experiment,
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:27.160]   because it opened my eyes to so many different things.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.400]   One, it was that these cells are not static.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:34.040]   Because since we have been seeing them for decades,
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.000]   just in slices or fixed tissue,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.920]   and we have lost the notion
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.920]   that this thing is constantly moving, right?
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.760]   - The cells are actually moving.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.440]   - The cells are actually moving.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.800]   - So these cells line the gut,
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.120]   meaning they're along the walls of the gut.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.040]   - Yeah. - The intestine.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:48.880]   - Yeah, the intestine.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.800]   - They reach a hand into the gut
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.880]   to sense whatever chemicals are there.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.160]   - Yeah, they have little cilia, little hair, or microvilli,
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.000]   that is literally like little hair
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.240]   that is exposed to the lumen, you know?
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.080]   - So the lumen, folks, is the cavity,
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.440]   the empty cavity of the gut.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:09.000]   Not empty, but you know, the internal part.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.680]   And so they're sensing the chemicals there,
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.960]   and you're saying they can move, okay?
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.000]   And they're sending a process.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.840]   By the way, folks,
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.720]   anytime you don't know whether or not
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.640]   something is a dendrite or an axon,
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.080]   just call it a process.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.680]   You'll get it right.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.320]   A process up to the brain.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.960]   - Underneath that will connect to the nervous system.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.960]   - I see, so through a series of stations.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:31.800]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.080]   Amazing.
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:38.000]   So what we're talking about here is Diego's discovery
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.620]   of a pathway from the gut to the brain
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.240]   that essentially allows sensing
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.120]   of what's happening in the gut to inform feelings,
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.280]   decisions. - That's correct.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.720]   - Yeah, so that was the first experiment
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.920]   like showing in a dish, right?
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:57.040]   The next experiment was, well, does it happen in the mouse?
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.960]   And then through a series of,
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.280]   I have a friend, neuroscientist,
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.560]   that she calls these rabies gymnastics
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.880]   because you have to put in some genes and make things work.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.420]   Then we demonstrated that these cells,
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.160]   that the virus will be capable
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.580]   of infecting these cells specifically.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.160]   Instead of infecting the other epithelial cells,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.160]   it will infect these neuropithelial cells
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.200]   because rabies likes neurons.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.980]   And then it will jump from that cell into a nerve fiber.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:30.060]   And these rabies can only jump one connection, right?
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:34.840]   And what was surprising is that the fluorescence
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.880]   from the rabies will show up in the brainstem
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.720]   and in the bodies of the cells
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.240]   that are in the notos ganglia,
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.120]   which is this cluster where the cell bodies
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.920]   of the neurons of the vagus nerve
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.200]   are located right underneath the neck.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.600]   Meaning that there was just one stop
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:58.600]   between the surface of the intestine and the brainstem.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:05.440]   The two cells were connecting that space, you know?
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.720]   So obviously the information,
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.200]   that was the anatomical basis for the information
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.440]   to travel very rapidly up into the brain.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.320]   And rapidly in the subconscious, right?
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.920]   Like we're not necessarily aware of it.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.480]   Although I've read that there are some instances
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.200]   in which people become more aware of it,
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.200]   either in a typical fashion or with meditation
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.560]   and other things that people can become aware.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.800]   - Yes, people definitely can become more aware
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.440]   of their so-called interoception.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.400]   What's going on at the level of their heartbeat frequency
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.160]   or their gut sensing if they spend time on it.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.680]   Some people, as you mentioned,
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.580]   develop an almost pathologic sense of interoception
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.880]   such that they have trouble navigating normal life
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.080]   because they're so aware
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.720]   of what's going on inside their body.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.960]   This is actually an interesting issue
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.640]   in the field of psychiatry.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.880]   My colleagues in psychiatry at Stanford tell me
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.160]   that some people with a lot of anxiety, for instance,
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.840]   are so aware of their heartbeat
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.900]   that it becomes disruptive and distracting to them.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.640]   So it's not always the case
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.360]   that it's better to become more aware
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.800]   of your internal processing.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.520]   Sometimes it can be deleterious.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.720]   Other times it can be good for us.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.760]   Some people are very unaware
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.880]   of what's happening in their body
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.340]   and they need to develop more awareness of that.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.280]   I feel like as long as we're talking about rabies,
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.560]   we should have a little bit of fun
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.560]   and explain to people something about rabies viruses
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.680]   because what we've been talking about
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   is the use of viruses as experimental tools
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.620]   in order to take a virus,
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.200]   basically attach or put something in
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.800]   so that whatever cell is infected by it
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.880]   glows a certain color so you can see the cells
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.480]   and visualize the circuitry.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.800]   But as long as we're talking about rabies,
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.560]   I feel like it's such a word that has such salience.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.820]   The rabies virus, which exists in nature,
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.400]   is amazing because it's,
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.760]   I don't know if it has a consciousness,
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.480]   but it essentially propagates between animals
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.160]   by way of the animals that have it bite.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.340]   They become more aggressive.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:13.260]   They bite a target animal.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.740]   The virus gets in, it's picked up by the nerve terminals
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:19.700]   and is carried back from one cell to the next
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.940]   across synaptic connections, right?
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.440]   Synapses, the little gaps between neurons.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.920]   And what Dr. Diego Borges has been telling us
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.180]   is that scientists have engineered the rabies virus
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.920]   so that it only jumps one station and then stops.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.700]   You can do this by modifying the coat protein.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:40.220]   There's a bunch of fun virology that can be done to do that.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.900]   But what I find amazing about rabies virus,
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.140]   and there's a great book, by the way, called "Rabid,"
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:50.040]   which is essentially a history of the study of rabies,
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.980]   is that once it travels from the site of the bite
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.500]   up to the brain, what does it do?
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:00.480]   It changes the brain to make the now infected animal
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.100]   or person more aggressive
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.100]   so that then they go bite somebody else.
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.420]   So, I mean, in some ways that the viruses
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.260]   have a sort of kind of unconscious genius to them, right?
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.960]   What's the best way to get from one animal to the next?
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.820]   Well, there are a number of different ways,
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.140]   but one way is to just make that animal more aggressive
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.500]   so it goes and bites things.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.140]   - Yeah, make the animal work for you, right?
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.140]   - Make the animal work for you, right.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.300]   It's almost exploitive, right?
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.820]   It exploits a certain circuitry in the nervous system.
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:29.980]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.500]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.420]   By now, most of you have heard me tell my story
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.100]   about how I've been taking AG1 once or twice a day,
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.220]   every day since 2012, and indeed that's true.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.520]   I started taking AG1 and I still take AG1
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.180]   once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.100]   and minerals that I might not be getting enough of
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.740]   from whole foods that I eat,
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.660]   as well as adaptogens and micronutrients.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:54.020]   Those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.640]   because even though I strive to eat most of my foods
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.540]   from unprocessed or minimally processed whole foods,
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.820]   it's often hard to do so, especially when I'm traveling
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.480]   and especially when I'm busy.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.720]   So by drinking a packet of AG1 in the morning
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.060]   and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.020]   I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need.
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.820]   I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.860]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1 regularly,
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.420]   just report feeling better.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.700]   And that shouldn't be surprising
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.940]   because it supports gut health.
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.620]   And of course, gut health supports immune system health
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.820]   and brain health, and it's supporting a ton
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.300]   of different cellular and organ processes
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.200]   that all interact with one another.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.980]   So while certain supplements are really directed
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.540]   towards one specific outcome,
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.660]   like sleeping better or being more alert,
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.020]   AG1 really is foundational nutritional support.
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:41.340]   It's really designed to support all of the systems
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.540]   of your brain and body that relate to mental health
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:44.560]   and physical health.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.840]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.220]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.660]   to claim a special offer.
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.060]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.700]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:59.860]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:04.140]   - Okay, so you identified these, you said described,
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.260]   but I'll say discovered 'cause that's what happened.
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:11.060]   You discovered these cells, you label their connections,
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.900]   you see that there's just two stations between these cells,
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.100]   or one station really between these cells and the brain.
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:22.340]   And so now these cells can sense chemicals in the gut
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.740]   that are the consequence of the breakdown of food
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.660]   and send that information directly to the brain.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:29.580]   What does the brain do with that information?
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.580]   - All right, so here comes the key experiment.
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.540]   And this was building obviously on the work
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.900]   of other scientists that had already described
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.820]   that the gut had some receptors for sugars,
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.580]   specifically for glucose, for other nutrients.
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.860]   Around this area in the early 2000s,
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.740]   when we were starting to be able to identify
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.260]   some of these cells,
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:55.260]   then it quickly became obvious that these cells,
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.420]   these enteroendocrine cells,
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:02.140]   throughout the lining of the stomach, intestine, colon,
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.980]   they had multiple receptors for multiple nutrients.
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.180]   Like we have the macronutrients, for instance,
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.900]   sugars, fats, proteins,
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:14.580]   but within them we have a repertoire of molecules,
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.660]   multiple lipids, multiple types of sugars,
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:18.980]   and so on and so forth.
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.460]   And these cells, depending on their location,
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:24.740]   they will express different type of receptors
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.980]   or a combination of those receptors.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.700]   And I said that depending on the location,
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.180]   because when we're eating, let's say an apple,
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.420]   the apple is gonna be partially undigested
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.100]   by the time that it enters the intestine,
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.020]   but by the time that it gets to the colon,
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.180]   most of those nutrients have been absorbed
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.100]   and perhaps only fibers are surviving
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.260]   to feed off most of the microbes
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.860]   that live in the colon, right?
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:49.860]   So the gut has evolved to mirror
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.700]   and to become a Velcro to the molecules
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.940]   that will be in that specific space.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.260]   So it will detect.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:03.260]   So it will detect sugars more in the proximal intestine,
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.420]   but fibers or fermented by-products
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.740]   more in the distal intestine or in the colon,
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.860]   like short-chain fatty acids, butyrate, propionate,
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.340]   and so on and so forth, you know.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.660]   - What other kinds of nutrients
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.420]   do these neuropod cells detect from food?
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:19.500]   So you mentioned sugars,
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.540]   you mentioned fermentation,
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.980]   presumably short and long-chain fatty acids.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.100]   - Yes, the short answer is that,
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.780]   I think that in due time,
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.780]   we are gonna realize that they detect
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.060]   just about every single thing
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.780]   that we put on our mouths every day, you know,
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.020]   that they have some either,
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.500]   and a specific receptor that is dedicated to it,
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.900]   or a combination of receptors
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:47.380]   to be able to detect some of these compounds.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.220]   And not only the chemical compounds,
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.900]   but also an area that I think
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.620]   that is gonna be fascinating in the future
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.340]   is the mechanical extension
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:57.860]   plus the adjustment in temperature
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.500]   as the chyme starts to flow
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.820]   from the mouth into the colon.
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:07.180]   Like for instance, I heard this from a bioengineer
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.580]   not long ago that was engineering
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.060]   artificial gut and stomach.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:15.740]   And he shared with me a piece of information
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:16.860]   that I was not aware of,
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.100]   that the esophagus has to adjust
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.460]   the temperature of the food very rapidly within seconds
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:27.740]   into physiological temperature of the inside of the body.
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.920]   Like, so if we're having hot coffee,
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.900]   within a couple of seconds,
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.220]   it has to be at the physiological temperature of the body
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.980]   by the time that it gets into the stomach, right?
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.940]   And all of that happens in very rapidly.
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.220]   - Amazing. - In the esophagus, right?
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.660]   - So if I understand correctly,
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:45.060]   these neuropod cells have a variety of different receptors,
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:47.180]   depending on where they are located
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.700]   along the trajectory from the mouth to the rectum.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.540]   - That's correct.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.660]   - And some are sensing sugar,
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.380]   some are sensing temperature,
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:00.380]   some are sensing pH, so relative acidity.
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:04.700]   Some are sensing amino acids, presumably.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.980]   I mean, I've heard it said,
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.380]   and I believe there's a researcher down in Australia
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.460]   who has been very bullish on the theory
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.740]   that we are not exclusively,
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:18.640]   but we are predominantly amino acid foraging machines,
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.420]   because we need amino acids
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.020]   for all sorts of important biological processes.
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:27.940]   And these cells are essentially evaluating how much sugar,
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:32.740]   how much leucine, how much short-chain fatty acid,
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.900]   how much essential fatty acids of different kinds,
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.300]   and then making changes to the gut itself,
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.620]   but then presumably signaling that information
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:42.180]   elsewhere in the body.
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.260]   So here I'm gonna give you something
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.820]   that will get your gut churning, so to speak.
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:52.380]   So these cells have to make sense
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.900]   not only of the molecule that had been adjusted,
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.500]   meaning the chemistry of the molecule.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.300]   Let's say it's glucose, it has to make sense
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.640]   a little bit of the taste.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.460]   Is it sweet, right, is it bitter?
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:04.500]   Then it has to take into account
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:09.020]   how much of the molecule is absorbed inside of the cell.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.880]   So that's the second layer of integration.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:15.460]   Then once the cell has eaten that molecule, so to speak,
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:19.260]   then that molecule will be digested inside of the cell
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:23.060]   to release ATP or some other compound.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.940]   ATP is for energy, for instance.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.020]   That has also have to be taken into account.
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.380]   For instance, in glucose.
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.060]   Glucose activates the TAS1R3,
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.900]   which is a sweet taste receptor.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.100]   Then the glucose is absorbed
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.980]   by some of the sodium glucose transporters,
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.540]   which are active transporters.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.500]   And these transporters depolarize the cell.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.780]   And then once glucose gets inside of the cell,
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.500]   glucose enters the TCA cycle,
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.500]   is catabolized, and then produces ATP.
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.180]   And the ATP further activates
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:56.220]   another voltage-gated channel,
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:59.460]   further depolarizing the cell.
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:03.820]   And then the cell releases, in turn, a transmitter.
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.140]   For instance, glutamate that very rapidly tells
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.620]   the vagus nerve within milliseconds, you know, I got sugar.
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.660]   And it tells it in two phases
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.660]   because that glutamate will activate
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.340]   two different type of receptors,
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.740]   ionotropic, which are very fast,
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:21.420]   and metabotropic, which are a little bit more delayed.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:25.260]   But then the metabolism of that glucose
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.820]   that produces the ATP and further depolarizes the cell,
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.420]   we believe that it will cause the release
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:33.420]   of the hormone, of the neuropeptide.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.260]   So then the neuropeptide comes on top of that
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.140]   and gives you that full experience
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.980]   of what it means to consume sugar, right?
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.700]   So that happens at the level of one cell
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.060]   and at the level of one molecule.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.980]   So imagine, like, all of the computation
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.700]   that the gut has to be making
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:52.940]   for each one of the molecules
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.500]   throughout the digestive tract.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.820]   - So if I stand back from this picture,
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:02.740]   what I get is there are very interesting cell types
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.380]   that line our gut that are evaluating
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.140]   all of the, not just macronutrients,
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.580]   proteins, fats, and carbohydrates,
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.220]   but micronutrients within the food we eat,
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:15.900]   as well as some of the other qualitative features,
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.140]   temperature, for instance,
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.980]   maybe even quality of the amino acids
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.060]   or the sugars, you know,
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.380]   simple versus complex sugars, et cetera.
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:28.620]   If we could just further zoom out for a moment
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.540]   and take a human perspective on this
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.040]   at the level of experience.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.220]   I once heard you tell a story
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.100]   about someone you knew
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:42.620]   who changed their gut radically
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:46.340]   and that changed their entire perceptual experience
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.860]   of food, including certain cravings.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.500]   Would you mind sharing that story?
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.100]   - Yes, thank you for bringing that story, Andrew.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.740]   That story is very personal to me.
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:58.460]   I often say when I get on stage
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.060]   that we are constantly influenced
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:01.100]   by two things in life,
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.060]   the food that we eat and the people that we meet,
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.100]   you know, like now we have known each other,
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.140]   but now we meet in person
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.060]   and we are knowing other people, right?
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:13.860]   And I remember that when I was starting my PhD
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.100]   in nutrition at North Carolina State University,
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.900]   I was, so I didn't grow up in the United States,
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:21.020]   I grew up in Ecuador,
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:26.020]   and I was invited to my first Thanksgiving celebration.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.900]   So I sat at dinner and, you know,
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.300]   as we began chatting with the people
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.340]   that were next to each other,
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:37.500]   all of a sudden I was enthralled in this conversation
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.220]   of a woman telling me this story
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:43.300]   about her experience with gastric bypass surgery
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.780]   for treating obesity.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.340]   So gastric bypass surgery was begun
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:53.180]   to be developed by surgeons in the '60s.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:57.460]   And by the '90s, it had become a mainstream type of surgery
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:01.020]   for the treatment of chronic obesity.
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.860]   So she told me that there were primarily
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.020]   three things that happened.
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:07.700]   She said, well, within six months of the surgery,
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.500]   I had lost about 40% of body weight.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.220]   You know, she said, like, I was about 300 pounds,
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.540]   you do the math, you know?
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:16.300]   So it was a--
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.140]   - Significant amount.
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:19.020]   - Yeah, significant amount.
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.220]   She said, within one week of the surgery,
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.860]   my diabetes was gone, she said.
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.580]   I did not need more insulin shots.
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:29.580]   So I had the same reaction that you're having.
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.220]   I was like, that, you know,
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:32.980]   I don't know much about diabetes,
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.580]   but I know that it's a major health burden, right?
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:41.260]   But the thing that really caught my eye was when she said,
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.300]   but since you're studying nutrition,
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.140]   I want you to answer this to me.
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.660]   She said, why is it that before the surgery,
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:50.420]   I could not even look at sunny-side-up eggs, she said.
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:54.860]   Just looking at the yolk would make me queasy, you know?
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:58.980]   But after the surgery, not only I can eat sunny-side-up eggs,
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:00.980]   I actually have a craving for the yolk, she said.
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:04.580]   Every time we go on Saturday to a restaurant for breakfast,
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:05.420]   I will take the toast
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:08.460]   and I will actually clean the plate of the yolk.
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:11.700]   So how is it that rewiring the gut
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.580]   altered my perception of flavor,
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:18.780]   altered my cravings and my mind to get the yolk, she said.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.340]   - And even inverted her sense
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.740]   of what was aversive versus appetitive.
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:27.980]   And I guess for those of us that don't know, meaning me,
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.700]   I understand the gastric bypass surgery
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:33.780]   involves the removal of a portion of the gut.
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:35.860]   How much gut tissue do they actually take?
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:39.260]   Is it centimeters, inches?
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.140]   I mean, the gut's a long distance.
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.460]   So what do they do for gastric bypass?
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:48.020]   - In simple terms, the classic surgery
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:52.420]   is called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery,
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:56.260]   which involves a reduction of the stomach
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:01.060]   and shortcutting the connection of the stomach
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:01.900]   to the intestine.
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:06.940]   So you will cut one third, which will be the duodenum,
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.980]   one third of that will be cut
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:13.220]   and then that portion will be reconnected to the stomach,
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:16.420]   meaning that you're short-circuiting the gut.
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.700]   And the whole idea was, at the very beginning,
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.260]   was like, well, if we reduce the surface
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.260]   that is exposed to food,
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.660]   then we can reduce body weight
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:29.220]   by the simply reduction of surface
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:32.660]   that is exposed to the food that is absorbed, right?
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.060]   And what it became very clear is that
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:39.740]   well before the body weight changes got taken place,
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:43.060]   there was already like some dramatic changes in physiology,
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.380]   like the hormones, the neuropeptides
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:47.740]   that were released from the intestine
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:49.860]   in response to nutrients, you know,
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.060]   it will change very rapidly.
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.580]   Then, as I mentioned, the food choices will change,
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.340]   diabetes will be resolved.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:00.540]   So then it became obvious that it was not necessarily
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:05.300]   just the reduction in the surface of the gut.
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.180]   So that's one of the main surgeries.
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.340]   The other one, as I understand,
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.900]   is vertical sleeve gastrectomy.
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.860]   And this vertical sleeve gastrectomy
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:19.660]   is simply a reduction in the size of the stomach.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.460]   So now the stomach is very tiny
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:24.060]   and the idea is that it will accumulate less,
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.380]   it could hold less food,
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.340]   and then the food will go very rapidly into the intestine.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.540]   And what is becoming very obvious
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.820]   is that there is a rapid change
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:36.060]   in the sensory function of the gastrointestinal tract.
[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:39.580]   So the gut seems to rapidly shift,
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.700]   perhaps become more, so to speak in general terms,
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.900]   more sensitive to the presence of nutrients, right?
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:46.740]   - Interesting.
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:48.820]   So this woman that you met at Thanksgiving
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:51.480]   had gastric bypass surgery.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:55.460]   And presumably, I think it's fair to assume,
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:57.260]   a good number of these neuropod cells
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:00.620]   that sense different nutrients were removed.
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.180]   And as a consequence,
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:05.980]   she completely shifted her craving of a particular food.
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:10.300]   And is there any sense whether or not, no pun intended,
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:15.300]   the lack of sensing of what was in sunny side egg yolks
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.980]   was somehow related to a shift in appetite or something else
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:25.020]   or is it merely a qualitative,
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:28.220]   albeit a dramatic qualitative shift in what she craved?
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:33.380]   - So two contextual pieces of information.
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.780]   So I remember leaving that dinner and I was like,
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:37.900]   whoa, this is major, you know?
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:40.540]   Like I'm sure that people have written about this
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:41.500]   or done research.
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:45.180]   And I realized that it was very little was known.
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:49.140]   Even gastroenterologists knew very little about this.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:54.140]   The first clinical report that the alteration in food choices
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:58.540]   was common in these patients came out, I believe, in 2011.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:02.780]   And then later on, scientists replicated that
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:05.020]   even in rats or in mice.
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.380]   We have done it in the laboratory
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:10.180]   and consistently they change their food preferences,
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:13.820]   their food choices.
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:18.820]   So in recent years we have been studying that system.
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:25.500]   And I will tell you that in 2022,
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.540]   this is another important contextual piece
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.260]   that we have not gotten to it.
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:35.260]   So after we found and we described that the cells
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.620]   were connecting to the nervous system
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.260]   and that they were sending information
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.620]   up to the brain very rapidly, the challenge was,
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:46.580]   well, if this is a sense, what behavior is affecting, right?
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:47.940]   Like how is it that is affecting
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.340]   the responses of the organism?
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:53.740]   And that took a little bit of a technical hurdle.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:56.780]   And here is where optogenetics comes in.
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:00.140]   - Yeah, please explain for people what optogenetics is,
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.060]   at least at a top contour level.
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:05.380]   - Yeah, so optogenetics in 2005,
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:10.380]   Professor Karl Deisseroth, Ed Boyden
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:15.380]   and other scientists had been able to make this dream
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:19.580]   of an experiment, which was isolate the genes
[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:22.020]   that encode for these opsins that are sensitive
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.380]   to specific wavelengths of light
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:26.180]   and put them into neurons.
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.660]   And now by turning that light,
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:31.060]   they could make the neuron activate.
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.980]   And then ultimately then later on,
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:34.860]   they went on to describe that that could be used
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:38.580]   to control specific cells that are regulating behavior.
[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:41.860]   And then by that define what cells are orchestrating
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.340]   certain type of behaviors like movement,
[00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:48.820]   food intake, thirst, anxiety, so on and so forth.
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:52.860]   So in 2014, we began trying to adapt
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:54.820]   that technology to the gut.
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:59.700]   Very quickly, we realized that the way that was,
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:01.660]   that light was brought into the brain
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:04.980]   was through a fiber optic cable that was rigid.
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:10.980]   And in the brain, it helps that it's actually rigid.
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:12.740]   But in the gut, it doesn't help
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:15.060]   because the gut is constantly moving and so on and so forth.
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:18.220]   So it's not compatible for running those experiments.
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:20.580]   And here's where I usually say like,
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.980]   we really don't know what is going on
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:25.300]   because some forces like move around us.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:29.620]   And in 2017, Professor Polina Nikeva from MIT
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:34.140]   came to give a talk at Duke and she reached out to me.
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.180]   And literally she came and as we were chatting,
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.820]   she said like, "Diego, I see that you're working
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.180]   "in this interface of the gut and the brain.
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:44.940]   "And I have this fiber optic that is flexible.
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.020]   "Will you have any use for it?"
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:49.980]   So with that fiber optic, that made a big difference
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:53.460]   to study interrogate the function of these cells to behavior.
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:57.500]   So when we were able to put those opsins,
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:01.500]   the light sensitive proteins inside of these neuropods,
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.860]   now when we turn the light on
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:06.980]   to shut off these cells very rapidly,
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:12.420]   we found something very interesting.
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:14.820]   So normally animals, when you give them the choice
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:18.900]   between a suriner, which is devoid of caloric value.
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:23.660]   - So like a aspartame or splenda or stevia or something.
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:24.500]   - Yeah. - Yep.
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:29.540]   - And you give them sugar, table sugar,
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:33.540]   the animal invariably will go to sugar.
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:34.380]   - They prefer sugar.
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.420]   - They prefer sugar.
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:38.260]   If they have never seen sugar,
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:39.980]   it will take them a little bit more time,
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:44.980]   but regularly by the second day is within 90 seconds
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:48.140]   that they detect what is sugar.
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:50.340]   - So they're drinking out of one tube,
[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:51.700]   they get some water with stevia,
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.860]   they drink out of another tube, water with sugar,
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:57.420]   and they invariably prefer the water with sugar.
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:58.700]   - That's correct.
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:03.700]   And people have described this phenomenon for a while.
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:07.180]   And in fact, in 2007, there was an elegant experiment
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:11.580]   done by Professor Ivan de Araujo at Duke University,
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:15.540]   in which the sweet taste receptors were,
[00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:20.540]   or the taste receptors were genetically erased.
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:24.420]   And the animals were not capable of distinguishing
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:27.180]   the sugar, the sweetener from the water,
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:31.460]   but they could still distinguish sugar from water,
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:33.820]   meaning that there was something else
[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:35.500]   that was detecting that sugar.
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:38.340]   - So just to make sure people are on board,
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:41.220]   an experiment where sensing of sweet taste
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:44.140]   at the level of the mouth is eliminated
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:48.900]   does not disrupt the preference for sugar water.
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:49.740]   - Correct.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:52.020]   - Which means that there's something going on
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:55.280]   below the depth of consciousness
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:59.780]   that causes mammals, presumably us included,
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:01.700]   to prefer things that have sugar.
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.460]   - Yes.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.580]   And then Professor Tony Sclafani,
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.740]   he had been studying these behaviors,
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.420]   and he went in so far to suggest
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:13.580]   that perhaps the sodium glucose transporters
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.180]   are some of the ones that are detecting the sugar
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.460]   as it enters the intestine,
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:19.460]   and that's what is causing the behavior.
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:23.140]   So we began working on the system,
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.160]   and we wonder, could these cells
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:29.540]   be the ones that are guiding that behavior?
[00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:32.540]   And around the time that we published this work,
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:36.100]   Professor Charles Zucker at Columbia
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:38.840]   also further advanced that area
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.540]   by building on the previous work
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:45.660]   and demonstrated that there were population of neurons
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.700]   in the brainstem that were integrating this information
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:53.520]   from the gut, and by that the gut and the brain
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.740]   were guiding this behavior.
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:58.420]   - And it is true that from the earliest of ages
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:03.260]   we crave sugar, or at least if we are exposed
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:04.540]   to the taste of sugar,
[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:08.180]   it tends to drive seeking of more sugar.
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.360]   I mean, you can see that in babies even.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.240]   - Correct.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:14.380]   And as I usually say, I call it instinctively
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:17.180]   because our mother doesn't have to teach us,
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:19.920]   hey, Diego, that is glucose, you know.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.820]   It may present us in some ways,
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.660]   but at the end of the day I have to go and get my glucose,
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.340]   get my amino acids right.
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.340]   Because eating is very simple.
[00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:31.020]   We're just trying to solve this issue
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.180]   of getting our carbons, getting our nitrogen,
[00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:34.920]   getting our phosphorous, our potassium,
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.780]   our sodium, and our chloride
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.560]   in so many different ways, shapes, or forms, right?
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:43.920]   So I went back to the experiment, the key experiment.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.720]   So when we were able to put these options
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:50.780]   and bring the light and shut off these cells very rapidly,
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.340]   when we had presented the animal
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.560]   with a choice of sweetener over sugar,
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:59.720]   then all of a sudden the animal became blind
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.620]   to the solutions.
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:04.960]   It couldn't discern between this tibia,
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:08.340]   so to speak, or the sweetener, from the actual sugar.
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:09.720]   - And the entire manipulation,
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.060]   the experimental manipulation that is,
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:14.580]   is occurring at the level of the gut.
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:15.660]   - The intestine, that's right.
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:16.660]   Right after the stomach.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:19.740]   It's like just a small portion of the intestine.
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:23.500]   - So if we make an attempt to transfer this
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.760]   to the human real world experience,
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:32.260]   if I have some ice cream, it tastes sweet.
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:35.900]   I like it, and now I'm thinking about it,
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:37.900]   and I'm craving it just a little bit.
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:39.760]   I don't have a huge craving for sweets,
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.120]   but I do like some of them.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.960]   - So eating ice cream, it tastes sweet.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.920]   The tendency is to crave more.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:48.740]   - That's correct.
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:49.880]   - Right, and you have to eat a lot of ice cream
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:51.520]   before you're truly full.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.120]   - Yeah.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.560]   - And most people self-regulate
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:56.760]   or their parents regulate for them
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.060]   by limiting the number of scoops or something.
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:04.880]   And that sweet taste is part of the motivator,
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:07.500]   but what you're saying is that
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.840]   as the ice cream enters the gut,
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.800]   there are neuropod cells there
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.200]   that are also sensing the sugar
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.780]   and signaling to the brain,
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:20.500]   and the brain is responding to pursue more
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:23.640]   of that sweet containing substance.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:24.480]   - That's correct.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:26.600]   - And it's happening below our awareness.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:30.060]   It is independent from the sweet taste of the ice cream.
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:31.120]   - Correct.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.280]   - The conscious sweet taste.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:34.120]   - The conscious sweet taste.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.940]   Whichever you think about it,
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:37.600]   it's not fully conscious, right?
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.680]   What we detect of the world
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:44.040]   is just a very tiny little portion, right?
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.600]   Even sight.
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:47.120]   We think we are looking for light,
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:49.680]   but I don't know what is happening behind my back.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:52.360]   I trust that everything is going okay, right?
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:57.260]   So when we shut off these cells,
[00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:00.600]   the animal, as I usually say,
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.840]   became blind to the sugars
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:08.320]   because it's kind of akin to having turned off
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.560]   the cells that are able to detect light,
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.360]   the wavelength of light,
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.240]   for us to be able to discern color, right?
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.600]   And it's not that the animal is losing its memory
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.520]   because then if you remove the light
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.340]   and now the cells are functional again,
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:26.360]   then the animal, again, is able to distinguish
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.080]   one solution over the other.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.280]   And then we did a couple more experiments in there,
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.560]   and what happens if we do the reverse,
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.120]   if we turn on the cells now?
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.400]   And the fascinating thing
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.900]   is that when we turn on the cells,
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:44.760]   now the mouse will eat the sweetener
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.600]   as if it will be sugar.
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:47.440]   - Interesting.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.880]   So the activation of these cells
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:54.040]   makes them crave non-caloric sweetener
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.940]   or low-calorie sweetener as if it were sugar.
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:59.880]   But is it blinding them to the difference
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:04.240]   between sugar and low-calorie sweetener?
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.320]   - So here's another piece of information.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.080]   If we will offer them water
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.360]   and we will turn on the cells,
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.080]   the animal will drink the water
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.160]   as if it will be sugar, like it will be appetizing.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.440]   - Even though it's just plain water.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.840]   - Yes, and what is becoming very obvious
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:23.840]   is that the gut has this sense,
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.440]   at the most basic level,
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.600]   what the senses are doing
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.440]   is calculating a couple of things.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:36.480]   One is the salience of the stimulus,
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.480]   is like how intense is the stimulus,
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.600]   and the other one is the valence of the stimulus.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.840]   Is it pleasurable or painful,
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.080]   so to speak, in broad terms?
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.100]   And I say this because on the pain side,
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:57.360]   Professor David Julius, Professor Holly Ingram,
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.240]   Jim Byra at UCSF, they have done some beautiful work
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.560]   demonstrating that there are these serotonin-releasing cells
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.480]   specifically in the colon, they have focus in the colon,
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:13.480]   that they couple to nerve fibers of the spinal cord,
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.460]   and when they are activated,
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:18.560]   now all of a sudden they drive what we call
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:22.940]   in the clinical realm visceral hypersensitivity.
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:26.000]   So they are responsible for triggering
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.100]   the hypersensitivity of the nerve fibers,
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.200]   the colonic nerve fibers,
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:33.800]   because they detect noxious stimuli,
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.960]   and then ultimately they gate that noxious stimuli
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.960]   and pass it on to the nerve fiber in broad terms
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.960]   as a painful stimulus.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.040]   - So is this Irritable Bowel Syndrome?
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:50.320]   - It is, we could call it as the biological basis
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:53.800]   of what could degenerate into Irritable Bowel Syndrome
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:58.040]   and so on and so forth, or this chronical GI,
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   they call them disorders of gut-brain interactions
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.200]   in the clinic.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.340]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.000]   and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.620]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.120]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.560]   to help you better meet your personal health goals.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.680]   Now, I've long been a believer
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.960]   in getting regular blood work done
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.720]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.780]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:24.500]   can only be analyzed with a quality blood test.
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.600]   Now, the problem with a lot of blood tests out there
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.200]   is that you get information back about metabolic factors,
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.080]   lipids, and hormones, and so forth,
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.240]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.520]   With InsideTracker, they have a very easy-to-use
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.200]   online platform that allows you to see the results
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.320]   of your blood test and then offers you
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.960]   various actionable tools, such as behavioral tools,
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.360]   nutritional tools, and supplementation tools
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.600]   that can help you move those values from your tests
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.600]   into the ranges that are optimal for you.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.200]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.560]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.720]   - As a neuroscientist, I was trained to think
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.400]   about the neural retina, the light-sensing tissue
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.220]   at the back of the eye, the cochlea,
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:16.220]   the essentially mechanosensory cells in the inner ear
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:20.360]   that respond to sound waves, not directly,
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.040]   but through a number of different transducers
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.160]   and this kind of thing, and then, of course,
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.800]   we are all familiar with the skin
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.480]   and that it responds to pressure, light touch,
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.360]   tickle, itch, et cetera.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.800]   What I'm understanding, based on what you're telling me,
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:37.760]   is that all along the pathway from our mouth to our rectum,
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.640]   we have sensory cells that are evaluating
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.560]   the chemical constituents of the foods that we eat,
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:48.560]   emitting broad, kind of maybe even crude,
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.540]   slow signals in the form of hormones
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:53.920]   to change our appetite, our feelings of well-being,
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.340]   maybe our feelings of not well-being,
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:01.100]   but also sending direct signals to the brain
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:06.100]   to drive certain types of thinking, emotions, and behavior.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:10.220]   What sorts of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:15.140]   are foods known to evoke through this pathway from the gut?
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:18.140]   Because the story about your friend
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:19.520]   that had the gastric bypass
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.720]   and then changed the relationship completely
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:26.720]   to the craving of or the aversion to Sunnyside eggs
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.220]   indicates that it's a pretty crude,
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:31.020]   as I'm describing a system to begin with,
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:32.860]   but it ultimately converges
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:34.780]   on pretty fine-scale decision-making.
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:37.780]   You order this and you avoid that.
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:41.060]   You really like this and you really are almost nauseous
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:42.260]   at the thought of something else.
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:43.740]   That's pretty high-level decisions.
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.540]   It might not seem like it to most,
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:50.240]   but it's impacting significant behavior
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:53.260]   or impacting behavior at a significant level.
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:54.140]   - That's correct.
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:59.200]   And when I think about that specific example
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:03.120]   is that after there has been
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:07.160]   this rewiring of the intestine,
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.940]   then now the intestine is very sensitive,
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:12.840]   so to speak, to the stimuli.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.840]   And when those lipids from the yolk
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.080]   start to enter the intestine,
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.880]   if that sensitivity has changed,
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.120]   meaning it could have changed
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:23.580]   in how fast it reacts to the stimulus
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.580]   or how fast it communicates to the stimulus
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:31.080]   and how sensitive it is to the saliency
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:34.000]   or the strength of the stimulus,
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.920]   it could communicate that, ooh,
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.240]   what it used to be repulsive
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.040]   with a tiny little bit amount,
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.320]   now it is actually pleasurable
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.080]   with a tiny little bit of amount.
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.840]   And here's a clear example.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.360]   So it has been very well,
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:53.240]   I will say that it has been documented in the clinic
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:56.520]   that patients that undergo gastric bypass surgery,
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.880]   they're actually more prone.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:02.880]   I think that it goes from like two to seven-fold
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:08.240]   the likelihood that they will develop alcoholism.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.120]   - Really?
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:14.120]   - Yes, because now the way that they describe it is like,
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.440]   well, either before I didn't like wine,
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:22.600]   and then now after a few months of the surgery,
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.160]   I'll have one glass of wine,
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.760]   and then all of a sudden I found myself
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.800]   going to two, three, four,
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:31.120]   and then they will become either more sensitive.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.080]   It's still not known the entire biology,
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:35.440]   but they will become either not only more sensitive,
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.920]   but more attracted to that type of stimulus.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:42.720]   - I can't help but ask about ozempic, Munjaro,
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:47.720]   and GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs,
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:52.400]   which are really kind of all the rage right now,
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.800]   at least for discussion,
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.000]   but many, many, many millions of people
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.380]   are now taking this for treatment of diabetes
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.080]   and for weight loss.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:03.280]   My understanding is that GLP-1
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.320]   acts at the level of the brain, the hypothalamus,
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.980]   to reduce hunger, but also at the level of the gut
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:11.820]   to give the sensation of more gastric distension.
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:14.840]   Is there any knowledge of whether or not
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.280]   GLP-1 interacts with the neuropod cells
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.880]   and this pathway that you're describing,
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:22.880]   given what these neuropod cells do for craving or aversion?
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.960]   - Yes, that's a complimentary question,
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.040]   and in fact, when I got into studying in this field
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:36.040]   15 years ago, the study among scientists in this area,
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:40.100]   glucagon-like peptide was already very popular
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:40.940]   in the study.
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:43.980]   In fact, in this area, people were very focused
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:46.180]   on the study of this peptide,
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.620]   and they were very focused on the study of this peptide
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:52.220]   because it was one of the most potent stimulators
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:55.020]   of insulin release in the pancreas.
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:58.260]   After gastric bypass surgery,
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:02.720]   it will actually increase its amount in circulating levels,
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:07.480]   and there were already some studies suggesting
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:12.480]   that the effect of this glucagon-like peptide,
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:15.800]   it was actually not through the circulation,
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:20.800]   but more in a localized action onto nerve fibers,
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.480]   especially of the vagus nerve.
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:27.480]   So there was already some ongoing discussion about this,
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:31.440]   and certainly some of these enteroendocrine cells,
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.860]   these neuroendocrine cells, particularly,
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:37.980]   at least in animals, I think it's more distal
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:40.940]   and in the digestive tract,
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:44.060]   that they do release this glucagon-like peptide,
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:50.060]   one in response to primarily all of the macronutrients,
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.900]   but primarily sugar.
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:58.140]   And then these glucagon-like peptide one
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:01.300]   will act on specific receptors of the nerve terminals,
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:02.960]   and then will trigger some of the behaviors.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:07.760]   It's also thought that it acts at the level of the brainstem.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:12.260]   And what it will potentiate is the reduction of appetite.
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:16.520]   So I say that this is a complementary question
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.760]   because what is happening in the first few milliseconds
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:21.600]   is the actual choice and the actual feeling
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.800]   of how you feel about food.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.560]   And what is happening in the minutes to hours later
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.040]   is the amount, how much you can eat, right?
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:33.220]   And when you should stop, because after four hours,
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:35.660]   you're gonna come back and feel again
[01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:39.820]   the tickling of the gut because the gut starts to churn again
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.180]   and it starts to call for food.
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:44.660]   Remember, it has to feed two giant organisms,
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.460]   the host itself, but also the microbes that are inside,
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:52.460]   right, so it has to keep, so to speak,
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:56.800]   that hunger going every four hours or so, right?
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.940]   So that's why the hormones are more acting
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:03.220]   on the cyclical, circadian way,
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:06.220]   but the transmitters are acting
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:11.220]   in this very fast, responsive way of the precise stimuli
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:14.500]   in specific regions of the gastrointestinal tract.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:19.700]   - So these neuroendocrine cells are releasing GLP-1
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:21.340]   or responding to GLP-1?
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.380]   - They are releasing GLP-1.
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:26.560]   - They're releasing GLP-1 to shut down,
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.780]   transiently shut down hunger.
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:30.480]   And probably there is some interaction
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.020]   between these cells that they are having,
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:35.460]   you know, the technical term is autocrine,
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:38.220]   or they are having like paracrine between the cells,
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:39.420]   you know, neuromodulation.
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:43.060]   But primarily, let's say they respond to the stimulus
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:45.520]   and release GLP-1 onto the nerve fiber.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.180]   - I have a theory for which I have no direct data,
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.060]   but I'd like your thoughts on,
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.340]   having spoken to a lot of people that work on nutrition,
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:56.620]   but also gut-brain access today
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:59.980]   and microbiome in previous episodes,
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:04.500]   that one of the key things that a human learns,
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:08.900]   somewhat unconsciously, but also consciously,
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:12.340]   is the relationship between a given food,
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:15.940]   which macronutrients it contains,
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:19.900]   the ratios of, you know, carbohydrate, protein, and fat,
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:21.440]   the taste of that food,
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:26.420]   the amount of that food translated into calories,
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.100]   but also physical volume,
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.420]   and then the micronutrients.
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:31.260]   Why do I say this?
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.540]   Well, there are a growing number of studies showing
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:35.740]   that the ingestion of highly processed food
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:38.420]   leads to the intake of excess calories,
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.100]   or more calories than if one consumes foods
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:43.060]   in their more natural form.
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:45.280]   Single ingredient foods or two ingredient foods
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.140]   are very different than a food
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:49.260]   that has a bunch of different things in it.
[01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:51.980]   And it seems to me that if we were to look back
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:53.580]   into our evolution,
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:56.200]   sure, people were making stews and soups and things
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.780]   for a long time.
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.500]   Presumably the sandwich came about
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:03.460]   through either desire for convenience or taste or both,
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.060]   you know, putting meats, protein,
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:07.820]   in between two pieces of bread, something of that sort.
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:10.540]   My definition of a sandwich.
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:13.840]   Maybe some vegetables in there as well, some cheese,
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:17.860]   but that what this whole pathway along the gut
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.620]   is trying to do, it seems,
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:24.620]   is to deconstruct what's coming in, what's here,
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:28.880]   and shaping choices, as you mentioned, about food choice,
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.520]   including the amount of food to further consume,
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.560]   and whether or not to return to that food or to avoid it.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.200]   And at the extremes, it seems pretty straightforward.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.560]   And this is a very classically described case, right?
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:44.280]   You go and you have the Kung Pao shrimp,
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.800]   or you have the lentil soup at a given place,
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.960]   and a few hours later, you don't feel right,
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.440]   start some sweating, some gastric distress,
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.700]   and you develop a pretty broad aversion to that food,
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:57.280]   or maybe even the entire meal, maybe the restaurant,
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:59.740]   maybe even that entire type of cuisine,
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:03.120]   depending on how much of a lumper
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.520]   versus a splitter you are, as we say in science, right?
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.720]   How much you make kind of large bin decisions
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.000]   or fine bin decisions.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.600]   This is nerd speak for saying, you know,
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.280]   do you go back to the same restaurant
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.360]   but order something different,
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.480]   or do you decide to never go back again?
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:21.220]   But that's a pretty extreme case, right?
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:23.980]   The other extreme would be you eat a food,
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:25.760]   it's delicious, you feel wonderful,
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.040]   the restaurant, the people, it's wonderful,
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:29.720]   and you crave more of that food, okay?
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.600]   There's all the contextual stuff too.
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.600]   But what we really are talking about here
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:37.280]   is how one navigates this whole landscape
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:42.280]   of what to put into one's body in terms of nutrition,
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:46.120]   and trying to understand how that's impacting everything
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:49.020]   from how we feel right away, how it tastes,
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:51.940]   whether or not we conceive it as good or bad for us,
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.460]   whether or not we think it's impacting
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:55.620]   our body composition and health
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.660]   in ways that we want or don't want.
[01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:00.220]   I mean, it's pretty complex stuff, right?
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:02.380]   This is at least as complex as going
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:04.900]   to a Metropolitan Museum of Art
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:08.160]   and looking at a painting and trying to evaluate
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.020]   whether or not you really like that painting or not.
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:14.040]   In fact, it's probably much more complicated than that,
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.140]   but it's what we do.
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:19.020]   And I'm beginning to get the sense, again,
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:21.620]   no pun intended, that this pathway
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:25.980]   that we call the gut-brain axis is really,
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:30.720]   it's a sixth sense of a very elaborate kind.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.780]   - So you just touched on an entire realm of a topic,
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.740]   which is one of my favorite topics,
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:42.200]   because at some point, as scientists, we travel the world.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:46.140]   And it started to become very obvious to me
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:51.140]   that wherever I went, we solved this issue of food
[01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:53.940]   in a very similar way.
[01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:56.980]   Whether it's a tortilla or two pieces of bread,
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:01.980]   which is another way of a tortilla, you have your carbs.
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:06.420]   And then you add a little bit of meat or a mushroom,
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:08.060]   and now you have your protein.
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:10.180]   - Or fish or chicken.
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:11.980]   - Or fish or chicken.
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:14.460]   - The carnivores will say mushrooms, not a protein,
[01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:16.180]   and the vegans will say mushroom, beans,
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:17.060]   lentils, great protein.
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:19.500]   We're not here to resolve that debate.
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.220]   Do as you choose.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:26.220]   - And then you add the lettuce or the vegetables.
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:33.340]   And here's the first stop in that discussion,
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:35.700]   because this is fascinating.
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:39.580]   There is some recent work showing that
[01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:44.220]   if you remove the protein from a diet,
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:46.740]   the animal swallows that meal,
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:52.660]   the gut evaluates that there is no protein in there,
[01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:55.100]   and it stops eating that meal.
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:17:00.100]   - Wow, so this is like ordering the vegetarian taco
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:02.700]   or burrito or sandwich,
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:07.700]   and then avoiding that particular taco or sandwich thereafter
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:11.980]   because it lacks protein.
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:13.220]   - Because it lacks protein.
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:16.100]   - Okay, so foods that lack animal-based proteins
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.740]   tend to be avoided going forward.
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.540]   - So here's the second part of that.
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:26.660]   And in fact, if the protein is low, not completely absent.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:30.660]   If the protein is low, the animal consumes more of the diet
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:33.960]   because it's trying to compensate for the lack of protein.
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.640]   And obviously, if it has sugars or fats
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:39.180]   that are more pleasurable, it keeps eating that meal, right?
[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:40.180]   - I see.
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:41.860]   - If the protein is completely absent,
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:45.020]   the animal avoids that diet.
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:50.980]   Unless that diet is very rich in dietary fibers.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:18:00.260]   And the study that I saw,
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:02.260]   which I thought it was fascinating,
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:06.400]   is that because somehow the microorganisms
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.060]   in the digestive tract,
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:11.760]   if they have enough highly digestible fiber,
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.700]   now they turn on the ability
[01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:16.500]   to synthesize essential amino acids.
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:17.340]   - Really?
[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:18.160]   - Yes.
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:22.580]   - So our gut, meaning the neurons in our gut,
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:25.060]   are essentially waiting for,
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:27.500]   hoping we'll give them a consciousness,
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:31.780]   proteins from animal sources.
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:32.620]   - That's correct.
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:35.640]   - If those animal proteins arrive
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.140]   in the form of meat, fish, eggs, et cetera,
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:42.980]   the cells signal to the brain craving more of those foods
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:44.920]   until satiety is reached.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:47.160]   But in the absence of that protein,
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.900]   the animal quickly learns,
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:52.520]   the person quickly learns to avoid that particular food,
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.260]   unless there's fiber in it,
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:57.320]   in which case these gut cells are able
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.320]   to now synthesize the essential amino acids.
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.480]   - The microorganisms.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.680]   - Excuse me, the microorganisms of the gut,
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:05.060]   here we're talking about the microbiome now,
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:08.080]   can synthesize the essential amino acids
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.320]   that ordinarily would come from the meat,
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.440]   chicken, fish, or eggs.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:12.400]   - That's right.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.800]   - So, wow.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:17.100]   So I'm an omnivore.
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.760]   I love meat, high quality meat,
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.200]   but I also love vegetables, fruits,
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:25.440]   and starches of certain kinds.
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:27.680]   But I have friends who are vegetarian vegan.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:31.680]   Many of them eat a vegetarian vegan diet
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.200]   that includes a lot of fiber.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.280]   And you're saying that the fiber itself
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.600]   can trigger the gut microbiome
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.440]   to synthesize the essential amino acids
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.720]   that ordinarily would come from meat.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:45.480]   But you also said, if I recall,
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:48.400]   that if there's a small amount of protein,
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.720]   so not zero protein,
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.640]   but a small amount of protein in there,
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.720]   then we crave more of that food
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:55.960]   in order to try and get that protein.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.200]   - Compensate.
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.040]   - Very interesting,
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:00.840]   because this is the first thing that to me
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:04.560]   squares the argument based on the observation that,
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.280]   or the hypothesis that we are essentially
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.680]   amino acid foraging machines,
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.400]   and that complete proteins
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.200]   in the form of meat, fish, chicken, eggs, et cetera.
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.200]   You know, there are those that argue
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.040]   those are the quote-unquote best forms of protein, right?
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.360]   The most complete forms.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.080]   But there are many vegetarians and vegans
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:24.360]   who seem to thrive on a vegetarian vegan diet.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:27.240]   And you're telling me that perhaps their body is,
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.880]   their gut microbiome is compensating
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.800]   for the lack of whole animal protein.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.640]   - That's right.
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.440]   - People who are trying to limit their meat intake
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:37.120]   are what, hungrier in general?
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:41.120]   So you're better off either indulging it or avoiding it,
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.000]   but not having a small amount of it.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   Is that the idea?
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.760]   - The idea is that the body or the gut
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.160]   will be able to detect that
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.680]   and then we'll try to compensate, right?
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.520]   - I see.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:55.440]   - And these, I actually learned recently
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:58.960]   from a friend, Laura Duval at Columbia,
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:01.960]   who works, does some beautiful work on mosquitoes
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:04.560]   and how it is that they feed on blood.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.440]   She came for the Gastronauts series.
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:09.680]   - Is she from Lesley-Valsal?
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:10.520]   - Yeah.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:11.360]   - Valsal, sorry.
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.200]   - Yeah.
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.120]   And what I learned is that
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.320]   when the mosquitoes are not reproducing,
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:21.040]   they can live off ATP, which is the energy molecule, right?
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:24.920]   But they cannot lay eggs.
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:29.720]   They need the protein in order to be able to lay eggs.
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:35.320]   Otherwise, the mosquitoes cannot lay the egg, you know?
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:39.480]   - So this leaves us with a picture of the gut-sensing cells,
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:43.760]   these neuropod cells as exquisitely sensitive
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:47.520]   to amino acid content in our foods,
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.360]   which makes perfect sense to me.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:51.120]   - And it has not been published or demonstrated yet.
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:54.480]   - Sure, we're now in the realm of new incoming data.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:55.400]   - Incoming, yeah.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.400]   - We wanna highlight this, bracket it,
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.840]   boldface and underline it as we're now at the cutting edge
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:02.440]   of what may be coming.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.280]   - That's right.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:04.560]   - Right, observation.
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.120]   But nonetheless, very interesting.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.920]   But there is this fairly longstanding hypothesis
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.440]   that we are foraging for essential amino acids
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.680]   because they are the building blocks
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.120]   of so many important things in the brain and body.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.840]   - And in fact, there is evidence on that.
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:20.920]   And Professor Stephen Simpson in Australia
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:26.840]   in the Nutrition Research Institute at Sydney University,
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:32.240]   he is a main proponent of this protein leverage hypothesis.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:36.840]   And in fact, a protein is the most satiating macronutrient,
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:39.280]   so that has been established.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:43.200]   And that's why normally we have focused on sugars and fats,
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.720]   but we have neglected a little bit on the protein
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:49.360]   because it's not as pleasurable as the sugars or fats.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.680]   But what is fascinating is
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.560]   that it is the most satiating nutrient.
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:55.960]   And as you know, it's like the most limiting
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.680]   and also like even commercially
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.400]   is the most expensive right now.
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.600]   - Yeah, I certainly have had the experience
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:05.240]   of at one time in my life really enjoying
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:08.320]   and even craving sweet foods, desserts and sugars
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.160]   and things of that sort.
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.240]   And I noticed that over time,
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:15.920]   if I eat sufficient amounts of meat, chicken, eggs, fish,
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:19.080]   which is not to say that I consume excess amounts of them,
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:22.360]   that my sugar cravings go way, way down.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.920]   That's just my personal experience,
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.120]   but I know it's an experience
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:28.240]   that family members of mine and others share as well.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:32.760]   - But I promised you that this was a fun topic, right?
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:36.200]   I couldn't, we couldn't stop at like just layer number one.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:39.320]   Layer number two is that in agriculture,
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:42.640]   we have this instinct to plant plants
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.920]   that complement each other.
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:48.360]   Like for instance, a classic,
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.840]   especially native, among native communities
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:52.620]   is called like the Three Marys.
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:59.520]   I believe it's pumpkins or some type of fibers
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:03.520]   with corn, carbohydrates and beans.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.100]   - So in purely plant-based diets,
[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:08.880]   there's an effort to get the fiber,
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.560]   the sugar and the amino acids.
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:13.800]   - That's right, and I grew up in a farm.
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.520]   My parents had farms and I remember when they would plant,
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.320]   they will also like throw in there the beans
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.080]   and the beans will wrap around the corn.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:23.000]   And it just seemed like so natural
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000]   and that's what you will do
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.320]   because that's what you learn to do.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.160]   But if you think about it,
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:28.500]   it's an instinct that we have developed
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:32.560]   even agriculturally and probably in the subconscious
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.880]   to cultivate them in such a way,
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.480]   or perhaps the plants taught us
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.360]   how to cultivate them in such a way
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:41.320]   that now when we put them in the plate,
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:47.400]   it just makes sense at the nutritional level.
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.120]   Because if you think about it,
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.540]   every time that we go to eat,
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:53.280]   how is it that we arrange that plate, right?
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.120]   There is some rice,
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:57.360]   which is very deficient in some essential amino acids,
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.720]   but it's rich in carbohydrates, right?
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:02.040]   It has some beans, right?
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.840]   And then there's some lettuce, you know?
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.240]   And sometimes we have like for omnivores,
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.080]   people will put meat
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:11.080]   or you would put other types of protein in there, right?
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:13.400]   - And certainly it varies by culture, time of year,
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.800]   food availability and things of that sort.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:19.260]   As long as we're talking about your upbringing,
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:22.180]   you have a fascinating story.
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:27.040]   So maybe we could discuss that for a few minutes.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.580]   Where were you born?
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:30.980]   - I was born in the Amazonia of Ecuador,
[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:34.460]   a small town called El Chaco in Ecuador.
[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:39.000]   It's on the slopes of the eastern slopes of the Andes
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.700]   on the way to the Amazonia in the Napo province.
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:46.340]   Coincidentally, it was like through the path
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:50.980]   from where Francisco de Orellana in 1542
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:54.380]   marched on its way to the discovery of the Amazon.
[01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:57.660]   Actually passed through a trail that later on reading,
[01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:00.920]   I realized that a native people had all of these trails
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.660]   between the Amazonia and the Andes
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:07.460]   and the coastal line for thousands of years.
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.300]   - You grew up in a very rural place.
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:14.300]   - Yes, the oil had been detected in the 1920s in Ecuador.
[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:22.820]   It was first explored in 1964 in the first oil well
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:30.920]   was in a town called Laguagrio,
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.000]   which now is only like three or four hours
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.560]   from the town where I grew up.
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:36.600]   But at that time it was like eight hours,
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.360]   the roads were not good.
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:42.240]   And the first road passed through it in 1974.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:47.140]   I was born in 1983,
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:50.220]   but I remember that we used to have like a giant
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:55.760]   diesel engine that will give us a light,
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:00.020]   electricity only from seven to 9 p.m.
[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:04.660]   I remember when my father bought the first
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:09.640]   color television in the town
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.340]   and then neighbors will come to our living room
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:13.740]   and then we will watch movies.
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:15.280]   - Wow, and this was in the '80s.
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:16.640]   - That was in the '80s, right?
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:19.020]   - Yeah, such an interesting upbringing.
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:23.620]   So did you eat a purely vegetarian diet
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:25.220]   or you ate meats as well?
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:27.160]   Where did those meats come from if you did?
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:32.160]   - Primarily from cattle, goats, sheep.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.420]   - So how do you go from the Amazon
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:40.180]   to a study of nutrition and ultimately neuroscience?
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:43.700]   - Yeah, that's the question, right?
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:46.100]   Like the deeper I go, the more I question this.
[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.300]   I used to think that, oh, it was very simple.
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:54.940]   Specifically when I was 11 years old,
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:57.780]   my father, he was born in 1932.
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:04.960]   He lost his father, my grandfather,
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.620]   when he was six years old and he was given away
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:11.720]   and he had to go and build his life.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:13.740]   He was a very successful entrepreneur,
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:17.100]   but in the process, he had made a lot of friends
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:19.000]   and acquaintances.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.020]   So when I was 11 years old, I remember specifically
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:26.340]   that a friend of his who was in the special forces
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:30.620]   stopped by our home because that was the main road
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:32.060]   that we go into the Amazon jungle
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:34.360]   where the folks in the special forces
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.860]   in the military will be trained.
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:38.900]   And he stopped by and said, "Hey, Rogelio,
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:40.700]   "what are you gonna do with Diego?
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:43.160]   "I think that it's about time that..."
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:46.040]   "I think that you should send him to the military school."
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:47.800]   And I remember in a matter of like,
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.640]   literally a couple of weeks or three weeks,
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:54.100]   I had taken the tests and I was accepted
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:56.380]   into the military school and then I ended up
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:59.080]   in a military school and this was the,
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.420]   at that time, it was the premier military school
[01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:02.780]   in the country.
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:06.960]   That alone, it was, with years, you start to understand
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:08.960]   the context in which you developed.
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:14.500]   And it was a very interesting context for a child.
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.100]   Like just to give you an idea,
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:21.100]   this school had the first and the only zoo in the country.
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:28.540]   So from my classroom, I would literally look at the lions
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:30.380]   and then I think that was by the second year
[01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:32.040]   that I was in the school, second or third year,
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:35.880]   that became, because the city started to grow
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:38.860]   and then the military school was wrong
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:41.720]   and then they separated the higher education
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:44.300]   for military officers, they separated them
[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:46.100]   and they put them in a different place.
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:48.160]   But that zoo actually became the first zoo
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:49.860]   of the capital of Quito.
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:52.860]   - Wait, so you had a zoo with lions at your school?
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:53.700]   - Yes.
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:55.200]   - And you said you could see the lions
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:58.080]   from your classroom and they could see you, presumably.
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.540]   - I probably know them.
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:01.700]   - Well, I assume they could see you.
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:02.940]   Lion vision is pretty good.
[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:04.280]   I don't know what the resolution is,
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:06.380]   but I'm guessing that their vision is, yeah.
[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:08.320]   They definitely use their olfaction,
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.880]   but they are sight-based hunters as well.
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:14.820]   - But I have specifically one memory,
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:17.260]   like climbing up, I think it was like from the,
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:18.820]   because we had an Olympic pool
[01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:20.860]   and we had all of these events.
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:28.200]   The soccer field was the field
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:31.300]   where the national team will go and train on
[01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:36.300]   because they didn't have their own training grounds.
[01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:39.680]   Later on, they had their own training grounds.
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:42.420]   But that was something that you just grow into it, right?
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:45.520]   But it was with the years, and now especially,
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:46.820]   that I get to reflect on it.
[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:49.780]   I was extremely fortunate through that experience
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:51.060]   and that education.
[01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:53.820]   And now I'm here sharing some of the story
[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:57.060]   and hopefully through that, inspiring some people,
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:59.700]   especially young people that would like to go
[01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:01.200]   and chase their dreams.
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:04.200]   - So you went to military school in Ecuador.
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:09.200]   You graduated and you decided to go to school in the States.
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:12.840]   - So in the military school,
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:15.800]   they will select the top cadets.
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:19.380]   Like I think it was the top 10% and they will select them
[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:22.540]   and they will put them through a special training.
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:24.080]   So you have essentially,
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:27.820]   I didn't have like what was a normal summer vacation.
[01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:30.260]   I would go into a military training.
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:35.360]   So for me, it was gonna be very, not easy,
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.300]   but relatively straightforward to transition
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:39.500]   into officer's academy, right?
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.420]   Like do four more years, like West Point here,
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:43.540]   and then like become an officer, right?
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:48.060]   In fact, I had a reservist officer degree when I graduated.
[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:52.180]   But two years before graduating,
[01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:58.540]   a friend of mine who, he prefer other types of careers,
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:02.180]   he said like, "You're not gonna become a military, right?
[01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:03.960]   "You're not gonna go into the military."
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:06.240]   And he said, "You should probably study something
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:07.500]   "that will help your parents."
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.060]   And then I said, "What will that be?"
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:11.620]   And he said like, "Perhaps agriculture."
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:16.060]   And I didn't think at that time, it didn't dawn on me
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:18.940]   that people can study for agriculture
[01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:21.940]   and agriculture is like the base of food
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:26.020]   for all of us, right?
[01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:27.020]   And then I said, "Where?"
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:28.720]   And then he mentioned for the first time
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:30.500]   this university in Zamorano,
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:34.460]   which was founded with some funds
[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:37.340]   that were donated by the founder
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:38.900]   of the Standard Fruit Company,
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:41.660]   which eventually became, I think, Chiquita Banana,
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:42.620]   Zamorano, right?
[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:45.620]   And that is an oasis that is in Honduras,
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:47.620]   outside of Tegucigalpa.
[01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:49.640]   So it's a boarding school, you wear uniform.
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:52.460]   So it was kind of like military, it was very strict.
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:56.420]   You cannot accumulate more than 12 demerits,
[01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:58.820]   otherwise they will send you home.
[01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:01.020]   - How do you get a demerit?
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:04.460]   - You show up two minutes late to work
[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:06.420]   in the morning at 6 a.m. in the field,
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:07.260]   and then you just get to--
[01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:08.980]   - Two minutes late, one demerit.
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:10.020]   12 of those, you're out.
[01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:10.860]   - Two demerits.
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:12.100]   - Two demerits, you're out.
[01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:14.940]   - Yeah, you get a, we used to get a,
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:18.220]   they will check your room.
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:19.540]   So for instance, a guest like you,
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:21.620]   if you will go there, like they will give you,
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:24.040]   every Wednesday, they had at 7 p.m.,
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.620]   they will check your room,
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.600]   but like very meticulously, right?
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:30.300]   And if they found a little bit of a dust on the window
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:32.200]   or something, two demerits.
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:33.980]   - And you're going home.
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:36.900]   - If you accumulate enough, you will go home, right?
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:38.220]   - Wow.
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:40.260]   - So it really forms character, right?
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:41.100]   And then--
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:41.920]   - Do you do that with your kids?
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:42.760]   - No.
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:43.600]   (laughs)
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.420]   I think that I have become very--
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:45.260]   - Do they make their beds?
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:47.380]   - They do make their beds, yeah.
[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:48.620]   But that was the context.
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:51.260]   And it was then where I learned about two things.
[01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:53.720]   One is where this idea of getting a PhD,
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:55.840]   because I noticed that most of the leaders
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.980]   will have a PhD, most of the leaders in the university.
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:00.760]   And I realized in the United States
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.700]   is one of the training grounds,
[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:04.220]   main training grounds for PhDs.
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:06.500]   And the other one was nutrition.
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:08.620]   I was a little bit more keen on perhaps
[01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:12.100]   going into a veterinary school.
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:18.260]   And then I had an experience in a dairy farm in California
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:21.340]   where I learned the value of nutrition.
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:22.580]   There was more prophylactic
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:27.240]   rather than a palliative, like treating the cow, right?
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:29.840]   And that kind of convinced me
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:33.840]   to look for a training in nutrition.
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:38.640]   And then a friend of mine, the late Abel Garnath,
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:42.260]   he was able to connect me with some friends
[01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:45.840]   and my mentor at North Carolina State University.
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:48.320]   And that's where I ended up doing my PhD in nutrition.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:51.500]   And that's where the career became.
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:53.320]   And then maybe another detail in there
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:57.720]   is that I was so excited about taking,
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:00.440]   that's where I took my first physiology class.
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.280]   And all of a sudden I realized that in a way,
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:05.760]   the body was like a machine, right?
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:07.400]   Leg obviously is a limited way of thinking,
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:09.240]   but the body was like a machine.
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:12.700]   And one of the professors was a neuroscientist.
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:15.200]   And I took two physiologists,
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.960]   two human physiologists with him.
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.900]   And I was just thrilled by when he will explain
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:24.100]   how is it that in the synaptic terminal,
[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:27.460]   there were these vesicles that had like these proteins
[01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:30.580]   that will walk the vesicle in the presynaptic active zone.
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:32.340]   And that's how we make movement, you know,
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:33.540]   or something like that.
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:36.460]   And I guess I kept that in the background of my head.
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:39.060]   And when I had the opportunity to work in the gut,
[01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:40.880]   I applied that.
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.220]   - So you were enchanted by the nervous system.
[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:44.060]   - Yes.
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:46.240]   - As I was too.
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:52.940]   Nothing to me is more spectacular than the realization
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:56.020]   that we are made up of these little tiny cells,
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:56.880]   many different types,
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:59.580]   but that the neurons essentially govern
[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:02.100]   our entire experience of life.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:03.440]   That's just amazing.
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:08.900]   Well, that's quite a journey from the Amazon to,
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:12.260]   well, this table and much more, of course.
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:15.100]   Thank you for sharing that.
[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:19.100]   So you grew up in a, let's call it a plant rich environment,
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:22.780]   the Amazon, at least from the pictures I've seen are very.
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:26.020]   Let's talk about plants, botanicals,
[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:30.340]   and the idea that maybe plants,
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:31.600]   for lack of a better way to put it,
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:36.600]   have a certain intelligence or a composition
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:39.460]   that is not random with respect
[01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:42.900]   to our interactions with them, right?
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:46.140]   You described how agriculture in some places
[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:49.020]   has evolved to include and ensure
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:50.940]   the different macronutrients
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:53.020]   and essential amino acid intake,
[01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:54.860]   even in the absence of animal proteins.
[01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:58.220]   Is it the pumpkin or the squash, the corn and the beans?
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:02.460]   What are your thoughts on plants,
[01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:05.780]   perhaps from the Amazon, but elsewhere too,
[01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:08.260]   and their capacity to have things in them,
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:12.220]   chemicals that can be good for us
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:13.260]   at the level of the gut,
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:15.820]   but perhaps at the level of the brain
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:17.300]   or other organs as well?
[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:19.060]   Yeah, how do you think about plants these days?
[01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:21.220]   - So the first thing you mentioned there,
[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:23.300]   like intelligence, right?
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:26.780]   I mean, I don't know if that exact terminology applies,
[01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:28.660]   but I do like this word wisdom
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:31.580]   because it's reflective experience, right?
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:32.700]   And I say reflective experience
[01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:37.340]   because somehow we are going over the experience.
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:42.140]   And plants have been many more millions years
[01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:47.140]   of age on earth than any other animal, right?
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:52.060]   Therefore, they have had way more time
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.540]   to actually experience the ground.
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:58.300]   So to think that they don't know what is going on,
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:03.180]   I think is a little bit perhaps naive is the word.
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:08.180]   I went to the main court of these Mayan rulers
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:13.180]   in these Mayan ruins of Copan
[01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:16.900]   at the junction between Honduras and Guatemala.
[01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:21.260]   This was a very special city of the Mayans.
[01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:24.060]   And in the main court, you see like all of these stelas,
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:26.780]   which are like the main stones
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:30.460]   of the kings of several dynasties.
[01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:35.460]   And at the top of one of the stairs on these pyramids,
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:41.460]   there is this giant ceiba tree,
[01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:46.460]   which is like 650 years old, something like that.
[01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:50.660]   So that tree was there before the Spaniards landed in there
[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:54.740]   when the Mayans perhaps were still celebrating things
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:57.820]   or perhaps right after, right?
[01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:01.140]   So imagine how much information that organism has in there.
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:04.540]   And we will be able to just tap somehow
[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:09.580]   into that information, like climate, fluctuations,
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:13.900]   organisms, interactions, movements.
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:15.700]   I mean, like so many different things, right?
[01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:18.380]   Like that right now, I don't think that we even have
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:21.500]   the language of being able to understand
[01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:24.980]   at the organismic level of how much information
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:28.340]   that is stored in one single one of those organisms.
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:32.820]   But then think about a chloroplast, for instance,
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:36.820]   or like one of the photosynthetic organelles
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:39.780]   inside of the cells.
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:41.900]   How is it that they have been shaped
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:44.700]   for hundreds of years in those organisms, right?
[01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:48.500]   And I think that perhaps in the future,
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:53.500]   this is more of a sci-fi right now,
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:55.580]   but perhaps in the future we will be able
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:57.340]   to harvest that type of wisdom.
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:01.900]   We will be able to understand a lot about the place
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:04.140]   or the earth that we live in.
[01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:05.420]   That's point number one.
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:09.660]   Point number two is that these plants
[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:11.860]   have been interacting and we have been interacting
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:15.340]   with plants for hundreds of years, right?
[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:18.140]   And obviously we are a consequence of the environment,
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:23.140]   like here driving in LA or driving in a major city
[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:28.780]   for some of us is just like second nature, right?
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:30.540]   But if you go into a jungle,
[01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:33.100]   then all of a sudden it will not be the same thing, right?
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:35.140]   But for somebody that has been in the jungle
[01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:37.020]   for hundreds of years,
[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:39.420]   now all of a sudden they are able to describe
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:43.060]   with such a sensitivity of like how it is
[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:47.980]   that the jungle is, the makeup of the jungle is in there.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:51.060]   I've seen native people walking through the jungle
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:55.180]   without shoes and right before stepping on a leaf,
[01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:57.620]   stopping and then pointing out like,
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:40:59.900]   look underneath that leaf and then lifting it out
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:01.540]   and then a tarantula right there.
[01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:05.540]   Like, how do you even make sense of that?
[01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:07.580]   Like, I don't have the sensory acuity
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:10.260]   or the wisdom to be able to figure that out.
[01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:12.700]   But they do, right?
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:17.340]   And certainly that is just a level of sensory perception
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:19.980]   that I am not equipped with.
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:23.020]   But I do think that there's quite a bit
[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:25.660]   of that interaction in there to learn.
[01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:27.940]   And then of course, not only for food,
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:30.220]   but also for medicine, for textiles
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:32.820]   and for many other functions.
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:36.660]   These plants have been part of the ecosystem
[01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:39.940]   of how these people navigate their world
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:42.500]   all the way from making a canoe
[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:45.780]   to making a backpack to carry a fish
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:47.620]   from the river into the house, right?
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:50.780]   - How do you think we evolved food choices
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:52.780]   and flavor preferences?
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:56.900]   I imagine humans, you know, that existed long before us,
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:42:02.500]   being hungry, the gut starts rumbling
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:05.180]   and there are all these plants everywhere,
[01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:06.740]   some nuts and some berries and things.
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:09.420]   And so they had presumably no choice,
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:14.140]   but to consume them and decide at the level of the mouth,
[01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:16.900]   like, that's bitter, nope, that's not good.
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:19.100]   Maybe eventually cook those
[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:20.700]   and see if that changes the relationship.
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:23.700]   Yeah, I'm thinking raw acorn versus cooked acorn, you know?
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:28.260]   But that ultimately there was a lot of trial and error
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:30.540]   and that these neuropod cells,
[01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:33.820]   which surely existed for a very long time prior to us,
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:39.820]   played a key role in discerning what's in these plants,
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:43.060]   barks, roots, nuts, berries,
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:45.380]   we're setting aside meats for the moment
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:47.220]   and other animal proteins
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:50.380]   and making decisions about what's nutritious,
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:52.700]   what is safe, what is not safe.
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:55.100]   And that's a pretty complex process
[01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:58.740]   given that some things might taste okay, go down okay,
[01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:01.780]   but then you run into serious trouble later.
[01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:04.100]   But given the critical importance
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:07.500]   of ingesting sufficient amounts of macronutrients
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.500]   and the need for micronutrients
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:11.420]   to survive on a day-to-day basis,
[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:14.040]   much less reproduce and propagate,
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:17.500]   one imagines that, you know,
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:22.180]   this is like almost as essential as breathing, you know?
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:25.100]   And that this path in our nervous system
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:26.700]   of the neuropod cells to the brain
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:31.700]   for sake of decision-making of yum, yuck, or meh
[01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:36.540]   is perhaps one of the most important core functions
[01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:37.620]   of the nervous system
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:42.180]   once you get past the elements that control breathing,
[01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:45.500]   heart rate, you know, temperature regulation,
[01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:46.660]   things of that sort.
[01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:50.100]   I see it as among the senses,
[01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:53.140]   it's at least as important as vision
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:55.740]   and perhaps more in terms of making sure
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:58.480]   that we survive from day-to-day.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:43:59.320]   - That's correct.
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:03.100]   And here's where I think there is a large vacuum in biology.
[01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:07.980]   If I will be with my biological,
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:10.740]   my training in biology,
[01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:13.820]   if I would put my hat of the training in biology,
[01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:16.500]   I wouldn't be able to explain much
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.540]   of like how is it that we figure it out
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:22.860]   because even if you just go to a botanical garden here
[01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:24.920]   in, you know, in the city,
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:29.120]   it would be really hard to figure out, you know,
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:31.420]   what plant is for what, right?
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:32.260]   - Yeah, what's safe to eat, what's not.
[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:33.080]   - What is safe to eat, what is not.
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:34.740]   - Do you need to cook it or not?
[01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:37.440]   - You know, maybe like the cacti,
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:40.260]   you are able to figure that out by touch, right?
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:41.780]   So from the biological perspective,
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:43.320]   I think that there is quite a bit in there
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:45.080]   to explore and to learn.
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:47.880]   There is some very interesting work
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:50.440]   from the anthropological perspective.
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:54.900]   So anthropologists and botanists
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:56.380]   that were studying the plants
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:45:01.140]   were exploring the jungles, not only the Amazon,
[01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:04.700]   but Borneo, Sri Lanka, and so on and so forth,
[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:06.100]   and studying the interaction
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:08.140]   of native people with the plants.
[01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:10.660]   And if going through the literature,
[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:13.860]   that literature, there is a pattern that emerges
[01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:16.100]   and like the native people,
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:18.600]   they talk about how it is that they actually learn
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.960]   from the plants, that the plants were the ones
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:23.680]   that will teach them, you know?
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:26.160]   So that's why I said from the biological perspective,
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:28.680]   like, how can we make reconcile that?
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:31.520]   I think that there is still quite a bit to learn.
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:34.240]   - What does that mean to learn from the plants?
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:37.480]   I mean, there's something that intuitively makes sense.
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:41.320]   When you say that, I've heard about, you know,
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:44.440]   looking at plants as teachers, about the local environment,
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:47.140]   you know, when they're open, right, they're light sensing,
[01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:51.540]   when they're closed, but, you know,
[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:55.480]   in terms of translating some of that to, you know,
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:58.860]   how humans have learned to navigate given environments,
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:02.120]   navigate meaning sort of thrive in those environments.
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.140]   How do we go about that?
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:07.060]   Does it mean taking plants, grinding them up,
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:09.600]   and figuring out the constituent parts?
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:11.380]   Or is that too reductionist?
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:13.060]   Is that gonna leave us with a parts list
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:14.160]   that doesn't mean anything?
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:16.940]   Sort of like if I splayed out all the pieces of a car
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:19.420]   or an airplane in front of us,
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:21.780]   it doesn't really tell us anything about that,
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:25.100]   except what parts make up the thing that flies.
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:26.980]   - Yes, and that's why I said, like,
[01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:31.980]   this is more on the anthropological studies that have,
[01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:34.300]   you know, especially from scientists that have gone there,
[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:38.300]   learned the language, live with the natives as natives,
[01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:41.020]   you know, and then start to understand the dynamic
[01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:43.300]   of their culture and their interactions.
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:46.600]   Then that's when, like, for instance,
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:48.960]   how it is that they classify plants.
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:51.560]   The way that they classify plants is like
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:56.040]   several levels more richer than our classification,
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:00.880]   our scientific classification by the two-name system
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:01.840]   or the variety, right?
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:03.280]   Like, for instance, they take into account
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:07.160]   not only the flavor, but also the shape,
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:11.600]   the location, how they interact over the year,
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.960]   how they react over the year.
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:16.080]   For instance, there is this beautiful plant
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:21.080]   that people call it the lips plant.
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:23.680]   I don't know if you have, but if you Google it,
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:25.200]   you will see it.
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.280]   - Looks like lips?
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.480]   - Literally like lips.
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:31.680]   It has, like, these red, beautiful lips, like the plant.
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:32.980]   It just looks like lips.
[01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:37.640]   And then people use it for pain, for some rashes,
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:40.960]   skin rashes, and also, like, in some rituals.
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:43.680]   And, like, most of these plants,
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:46.200]   the way that the natives interact with the plants
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:48.280]   is in a sacred level.
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:51.820]   You know, there is this respect for the plant, right?
[01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:57.160]   So, yeah, I think that biologically,
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:58.720]   I think that there is quite a bit in there
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:03.080]   to understand and explore and define.
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:04.440]   I do agree with you that, like,
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.320]   just thinking about grinding it up
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:08.320]   and, like, just putting it in a tea,
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:10.700]   perhaps is too reductionist.
[01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:13.840]   It could be a beginning of understanding,
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:15.480]   but it is reductionist.
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:19.040]   - Seems like nowadays, in the field of biomedical research
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:22.500]   and clinical research, that there's a lot of interest
[01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:24.780]   in plant-based psychedelics.
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:31.160]   You know, LSD from ergot and psilocybin,
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:35.420]   mushroom, and so on and so forth, ayahuasca.
[01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:37.100]   Iboga.
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:40.320]   So it seems like science and plants
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:42.600]   have merged at that level
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:44.000]   in terms of clinical implications.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.200]   Of course, there are entire fields of plant biology
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:47.180]   that are extremely important.
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:49.020]   I think most people probably don't realize this,
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:51.960]   but a lot of what we understand about circadian rhythms
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:55.880]   grew, no pun intended,
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:59.240]   out of our understanding of plant circadian rhythms first,
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:01.040]   and then it was translated to mammals.
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:04.400]   You know, beautiful work by Steve Kay and others,
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:07.620]   seeing the circadian rhythms in leaf opening
[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:09.620]   and the orientation of the whole plant
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:11.140]   and other features of plants
[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:14.020]   that are mirrored by the changes
[01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:17.780]   in arousal level in mammals, including us,
[01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:18.940]   which is why I'm always telling people
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:20.740]   to get sunlight in their eyes early in the day
[01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:24.580]   and to avoid bright light in the evening and nighttime.
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:30.500]   So what are your thoughts on plants as a source of medicine,
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:33.100]   psychedelic or otherwise?
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:35.160]   - I think that, well, traditionally,
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:38.760]   that's where medicine was developed from.
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:42.920]   I was at the Oxford Botanical Gardens
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:44.360]   last year with the family,
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:46.820]   and we went into the gardens,
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:48.120]   and they have a beautiful garden.
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:49.840]   It was established in 1621.
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:53.760]   I think it was the first botanical gardens in England,
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:57.360]   and they have a beautiful medicinal plant collection,
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:49:58.960]   and there was this very humble,
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:05.640]   what are we, little sign with a description in there
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:09.520]   that said in there that about 80% of medicine
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:12.160]   still comes straight from plants.
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:13.000]   - Really?
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.720]   - Yes, and if you think about it,
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.120]   it kind of makes sense, right?
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:19.840]   Because when we think about the medicines
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:21.000]   that we have been able to develop,
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.600]   which have been phenomenal,
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:24.900]   especially for certain chronic diseases,
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:31.200]   but we don't have a broad repertoire of it, right?
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:36.000]   So I think that has been, obviously,
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.320]   a great advance in our society
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:41.720]   that we have been able to identify the molecules,
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:45.720]   synthesize the molecules, package the molecules,
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:48.840]   render them bioavailable in specific sites,
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:51.400]   and I think that when we are able to couple that
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:53.840]   with the rest of the molecules that the plants,
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:56.220]   through their, I keep saying, their wisdom,
[01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:58.680]   because somehow they develop their ability
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:00.800]   to have not only one molecule,
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:03.200]   but like a combination of other things
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:07.720]   that will provide the full experience of the plant, right?
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:12.720]   For instance, yerba mate, it's not only caffeine, right?
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:16.880]   Because it's very different than a shot of espresso.
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:20.600]   If you take the whole thing, it not only gives you energy,
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:23.120]   but it gives you a full range of an experience
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:25.000]   that is specific to the yerba mate,
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.920]   which is a leaf, right?
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:31.600]   - Yeah, it's a distinctly different subjective experience
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:33.880]   than coffee, and I enjoy both,
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:36.880]   coffee and espresso and yerba mate.
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:40.760]   You were the one who introduced me to guayusa.
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:44.680]   - Guayusa, yeah, which is a cousin of yerba mate,
[01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:47.400]   because yerba mate is Ilex paragensis,
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:50.080]   guayusa is Ilex guayusa.
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:52.880]   And it's not as bitter as mate,
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:56.440]   but it has almost as much caffeine as coffee,
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:00.320]   and it has antioxidants and other compounds,
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:03.800]   which give you these very smooth experience.
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:06.560]   So natives in the Amazon,
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:11.560]   they take a drink of guayusa every morning around 4 a.m.,
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:14.600]   between 4 and 6 a.m.
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:15.840]   - But they wake up early.
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:17.200]   - They actually call it, yes.
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:18.880]   - It was like Jocko Willink early.
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:19.720]   - Yeah.
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:20.840]   - Some people understand that joke.
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:23.480]   He wakes up every morning and he posts a picture
[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:26.720]   of his Casio watch, yep, and he's already training 4.30,
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:29.480]   so no guayusa required for Jocko.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:35.440]   - And they call it the guaysa upina ura,
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:40.960]   the hour of the guayusa,
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:45.960]   and is a ritualistic drinking of the guayusa in the morning,
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:48.560]   and where they talk as a family
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:52.000]   of the issues that they have had the days before
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.800]   or the weeks before, like either with other communities,
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:57.160]   within the family, if they have to reprehend
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:52:59.360]   or reprimand one of the children,
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:02.360]   or talk to them about some mistakes that they're making,
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:05.800]   and then they plan the full day of activities
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:11.680]   by drinking guayusa, and around 5.30,
[01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:14.000]   because they will boil the guayusa, right,
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.360]   and they keep boiling the guayusa,
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:17.800]   and they just keep adding water to it,
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:19.880]   and then around 5, 5.30,
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:24.880]   then they will have what is called a bowl of chonta,
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:33.160]   and chonta is this palm date,
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:36.400]   very rich in lipids and fibers,
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.840]   so they will have the guayusa,
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:41.760]   because the guayusa, they say, that gives them energy,
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:46.760]   it heals any pain, it shuts down appetite,
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:49.040]   so they will eat at like 3 p.m.,
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:51.480]   you know, shuts down or modulates appetite.
[01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:52.680]   - As does yerba mate.
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:54.760]   That's one of the more potent effects, actually,
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:56.840]   of mate and guayusa,
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:00.120]   is a mild to moderate appetite suppression.
[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:02.440]   - And then if you combine that to chonta,
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:04.360]   which gives you the lipids,
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:06.860]   and then it's like a full meal until 3 p.m.,
[01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:09.520]   and then they go and work in the fields.
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:11.560]   - Interesting, so they're essentially starting the day
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:13.640]   with hydration, caffeine, and then they,
[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:16.300]   what in some circles they call fat fasting,
[01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:20.060]   meaning consuming lipids in order to stave off hunger.
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:23.800]   I mean, it's the highest density source of calories
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:25.360]   among the macronutrients.
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:29.580]   - And it's a vegetable-based diet, I guess you're right.
[01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:31.800]   - Are they a healthy culture?
[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:33.400]   Do they live a long time?
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:38.400]   - I am not, and I should probably do more reading that,
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:42.220]   I'm not well-educated in what are the studies
[01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:47.220]   that have follow-up on the health status of the communities.
[01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:52.000]   But what I can tell you is that, at least colloquially,
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.520]   I will say that diabetes, those type of issues,
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:57.500]   are not as prevalent.
[01:54:57.500 --> 01:55:00.800]   But they do have, obviously, through social exposure,
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:02.120]   they have other things.
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:08.520]   - Fascinating, this morning ritual of conversation
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:11.200]   about family and culture and what's needed
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:12.300]   and planning the day.
[01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:16.380]   We had on this podcast as a guest, Dr. Sachin Panda,
[01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:19.460]   who is at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies,
[01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:21.400]   often known for his work on intermittent fasting,
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:22.240]   time-restricted feeding,
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:25.200]   but also has done beautiful circadian biology.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:28.980]   And he talked about the use of fireside chats,
[01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:34.940]   not the sort on stage, but gathering around fire at night
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:36.900]   is something that has existed in many cultures
[01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:41.020]   where people reflect on the previous day and discuss issues.
[01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:44.600]   Social and work issues and sort of dissect what's happened
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:48.900]   and talk and it's about building
[01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:51.400]   and repairing relationships.
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:55.100]   Sounds like in this, is it, what is this group?
[01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:56.720]   Is it a rural, is this a--
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:58.760]   - Yeah, native community.
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:03.160]   Because there are like about 70 or so communities
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:06.760]   that have been documented in the Amazonia
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:09.060]   with their own language, with their own traditions.
[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:13.600]   And many of them share the same type of traditions.
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:14.440]   And if you think about it,
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:17.360]   like a podcast is one way of an evolution
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:18.560]   of that conversation, right?
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:20.680]   Like where we can have this extended conversation
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:23.960]   and get these, the more primordial things,
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:26.240]   the ones that we have them in the prefrontal cortex
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:27.880]   right away and like discuss about like,
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:30.840]   well, you know, this discovers these identifications.
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:33.880]   But then we get to the part of like,
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:36.360]   what does it mean for the whole community?
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:39.700]   - Yeah, there's doing, there's reflecting,
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:42.860]   and then there's resting and recovering, right?
[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:44.300]   - And there is something about like,
[01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:46.740]   living that for the next generation, right?
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:49.180]   - Yeah, passing on of-- - Passing on.
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:51.860]   - Lessons, but better learn from the mistakes
[01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:55.940]   and successes of others if you can as you go forward.
[01:56:55.940 --> 01:56:57.040]   Very interesting.
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:01.940]   If we could, I'd like to now return to the biology,
[01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:03.980]   the nervous system. - Absolutely.
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:06.360]   And thank you for that voyage through
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:08.640]   some of your background in Ecuador.
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:09.480]   Fascinating.
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:13.000]   I do for a mug of guayusa.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.040]   Sometimes I'll mix the two,
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:17.680]   the loose leaf yerba mate and the guayusa.
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:19.480]   And as you said, what's-- - How does it feel?
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:20.960]   - I really like it.
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:23.600]   Most of the time it's loose leaf yerba mate
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:25.060]   or cold brew yerba mate.
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:29.220]   But sometimes I'll mix in the guayusa leaves.
[01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:31.920]   And what I do like, as you mentioned,
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:34.680]   is you can continue to pour water over them for many hours
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:37.040]   and it tastes different as the time goes on.
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:39.680]   And my guess is you're extracting different things from it
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:42.000]   in different concentrations as time goes on.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.160]   I realize it's not a precise science.
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:45.920]   It's interesting, today we're talking about
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:49.580]   very precise neurons and methods of tracing neurons
[01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:53.480]   and sensing of specific amino acids and lipids
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:54.320]   at the level of the gut.
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:58.000]   And then we're also going to more macroscopic view,
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.600]   a kind of broader scale view of the plants
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:04.360]   having many things that need to coexist
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:08.000]   in certain ratios that the plants have evolved
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.600]   to create for us.
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:14.120]   So we're sort of straddling both ends of the continuum.
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:16.400]   - And if I could fit in there a story,
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.480]   not long ago, I visited a friend, a native friend
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:24.480]   in a nearby town and he produces some of the best chocolate,
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:29.660]   what I will say in the planet,
[01:58:29.660 --> 01:58:34.660]   because actually the plants of Theobroma cacao,
[01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:38.240]   it was recently documented, there was a paper in Science
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:41.640]   not long ago that it was domesticated in Ecuador
[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:46.340]   in near where I grew up and they have done some tracing
[01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:47.280]   and genetic tracing.
[01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:50.880]   And so he produces some of the best chocolate,
[01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:53.440]   like literally he harvested in there
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:56.120]   and then he roasted, grinded,
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:58.880]   and then he prepared it for us in there.
[01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:01.460]   And the Swiss are saying, or the Belgians, right?
[01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:04.400]   I claim the best chocolate, but now we know Ecuador
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:05.740]   is the place for the best chocolate.
[01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:08.080]   I think I just got a lot of Swiss and Belgians angry at me
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:12.040]   for saying that, but do they have a very dark variety?
[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:15.800]   I like the extreme dark varieties, 95%.
[01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:17.100]   Even a hundred percent chocolate,
[01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:19.860]   if it comes from a really quality source
[01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:21.620]   can be absolutely delicious.
[01:59:21.620 --> 01:59:24.260]   - It's like milk straight from the cow, right?
[01:59:24.260 --> 01:59:26.500]   And what he did is like, he said like,
[01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:31.160]   Diego, you have to try it with guayusa.
[01:59:31.160 --> 01:59:34.280]   And he mixed the chocolate with guayusa.
[01:59:34.280 --> 01:59:36.240]   - As a drink?
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:37.440]   - Like as a drink.
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:40.320]   Boy, like that will give you wings, you know?
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:41.840]   - Guayusa hot chocolate.
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:46.640]   - Yes, and it's a very smooth experience, right?
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:49.920]   Like you're mixing this tea, which is for energy,
[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:53.520]   with chocolate, you know, of the best quality.
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.980]   - So we're not talking about eating chocolate
[01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:57.920]   and drinking tea, we're talking about melting the chocolate
[01:59:57.920 --> 02:00:00.440]   in the guayusa.
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:03.760]   - It was something like one of a kind, you know?
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:06.120]   Then of course I couldn't sleep until like 3 a.m., I think.
[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:07.220]   - Right, there's something to do.
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:11.000]   Maybe this is why these groups drink the guayusa
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.100]   so early in the day.
[02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:12.940]   - That's right.
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:15.820]   - Yeah, and I have to imagine I would need caffeine
[02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:20.400]   at 4 a.m., 5 a.m., otherwise I'd be falling back asleep.
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:26.560]   - So back in the gut and nervous system,
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:27.960]   in particular within the brain,
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:29.760]   we haven't talked about the brain so much.
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:30.640]   - We kind of haven't talked.
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:32.080]   - So the information from the gut
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:35.720]   is sent via these neuropod cells up to,
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:37.800]   you mentioned the no-dose ganglion,
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:40.740]   such a cool name for a brain.
[02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:44.280]   And a ganglion in this instance is an aggregate of neurons,
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:46.680]   so it's like a batch of neurons,
[02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:49.440]   that then send a connection into the brain.
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:52.500]   What brain areas do they send it to?
[02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:54.480]   And maybe we could describe these by name,
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:58.340]   but also by function, what they generally are responsible for.
[02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:01.620]   - And probably should be prefaced with,
[02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:04.060]   ultimately will go to the entire brain.
[02:01:04.060 --> 02:01:05.980]   - Right, everything ultimately connects to everything.
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:08.180]   It's like Google Maps, everything connects to everything.
[02:01:08.180 --> 02:01:10.860]   But what are some of the primary recipients
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:11.700]   of that information?
[02:01:11.700 --> 02:01:16.700]   - Some of the first hubs of sensor integration
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:20.900]   are in the brainstem.
[02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:25.700]   You know, and for instance, the nucleus tractus solitarius
[02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:28.500]   is in a specific region within the brain.
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:31.100]   The caudal is one area.
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:33.100]   - And NTS, for those that don't know,
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:35.420]   is involved in regulating hunger and appetite.
[02:01:35.420 --> 02:01:36.260]   - That's correct.
[02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:40.780]   Other functions perhaps, but like for instance,
[02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:43.580]   that seems to be an area of sensory integration
[02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:45.420]   for nutrients.
[02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:47.720]   - And when we say drives hunger or appetite,
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:49.280]   sensory integration for nutrients,
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:51.660]   I mean, what would be great is if, you know,
[02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:53.160]   people could understand, you know,
[02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:54.380]   the language of the nervous system
[02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:55.580]   is chemical and electrical.
[02:01:55.580 --> 02:01:58.060]   So when these neurons are active,
[02:01:58.060 --> 02:02:01.100]   we tend to crave certain foods, you know, seek them,
[02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:03.540]   literally go to the refrigerator,
[02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:06.340]   among the different choices, go to that thing
[02:02:06.340 --> 02:02:09.780]   and select that and put it into our mouth.
[02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:14.780]   So presumably it's driving reward systems, motor systems.
[02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:19.320]   - I mean, what we call hunger and appetite
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:23.000]   is really a kind of a domino effect
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.680]   of a lot of different brain circuits.
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:29.680]   Do we know whether or not the nucleus tractus solitarius
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:31.960]   projects to the areas of the brain
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:34.680]   involved in dopamine release and craving?
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:38.240]   - Yes, and there has been some elegant work
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:41.200]   from several different neuroscientists in this area,
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:45.440]   like tracking the circuitry from there
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:48.340]   on to many other different areas.
[02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:50.400]   The hypothalamus, for instance,
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:52.580]   very basic behavioral functions.
[02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:57.260]   And the striatum, where there is dopamine release,
[02:02:57.260 --> 02:03:01.900]   and then there is this pleasurable sensation and reward.
[02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:03.940]   There are several other areas in there
[02:03:03.940 --> 02:03:06.900]   that are involved in this sensory integration.
[02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:10.220]   There is quite a bit of work still to be done
[02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:13.300]   from specifically from the neuropods.
[02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:15.780]   There is like some evidence that they are connecting
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:20.660]   directly to, or there are, if you put two papers together,
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:22.300]   it's obvious that they are connecting
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:25.300]   to like some of these areas of dopamine release,
[02:03:25.300 --> 02:03:27.820]   basal ganglia in the brain.
[02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:34.460]   And that's why they are causing this reinforcing effect
[02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:38.540]   like in the lateral hypothalamus and other areas.
[02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:40.120]   I do think that ultimately,
[02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:43.380]   there is quite a bit of a gap
[02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:46.800]   in like different regions of the digestive tract.
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:50.300]   Today, we just talked about the esophagus, right?
[02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:52.380]   Like the esophagus, I think that it's still,
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:54.740]   there is a little bit of work.
[02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:56.580]   Perhaps I think that Steve Liberlis
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:04:01.140]   has work in that area, another great neuroscientist,
[02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:04.580]   doing some very fine detail work
[02:04:04.580 --> 02:04:08.260]   in sensory biology in the esophagus.
[02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:13.260]   There is quite a bit of lack of precise biology
[02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:16.900]   in how it is that the esophagus,
[02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:20.060]   the specific cells of the esophagus are innervated
[02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:22.320]   or like making sense of the environment.
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:24.420]   Same thing for the stomach and how it is
[02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:26.920]   that ultimately each one of those regions
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:29.820]   are feeding into different regions of the brain.
[02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:34.780]   Even then, how each one of these valves,
[02:04:34.780 --> 02:04:36.900]   I'm fascinated by each one of the valves
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:41.900]   that we talked early on, like the gastroesophageal sphincter
[02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:47.140]   or the pylorus or the ileocecal junction.
[02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:49.300]   - Yeah, we should illustrate for people,
[02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:51.540]   I'm not an expert in the gut by any means,
[02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:54.300]   but what Dr. Borges is referring to
[02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:59.300]   is that the gut, as it extends from the mouth to the rectum,
[02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:04.500]   is not just a series of tubes of different diameters,
[02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:07.460]   but rather they have valves, chambers,
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:09.420]   and these sphincters that cut off,
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:10.700]   you know, everyone hears the word sphincter
[02:05:10.700 --> 02:05:12.420]   and they always think, "Oh, you know, anal sphincter."
[02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:13.840]   And then they, "Oh, you know, it's like, you know,
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:16.160]   "elementary school, middle school humor."
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:19.740]   But sphincters, they literally can close and open
[02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:24.360]   to varying extent in order to allow passage
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:27.680]   or prohibit passage from one compartment to the next,
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:31.020]   such that certain things can take place over time
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:33.700]   in one region, like the esophagus
[02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:35.200]   or within the stomach or, you know,
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:37.820]   before passing to other chambers.
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:41.920]   And so I hear you saying that critical processing
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:44.360]   is happening at each of these chambers.
[02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:45.660]   The sphincters are determining
[02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:47.620]   how long that processing occurs,
[02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:50.780]   and that distinct sets of neuropod cells
[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:54.500]   are likely detecting distinct qualities
[02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:56.080]   and quantities within the food,
[02:05:56.080 --> 02:05:58.100]   chemical qualities and quantities within the food,
[02:05:58.100 --> 02:06:00.460]   and relaying that to the brain.
[02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:01.300]   - That's correct.
[02:06:01.300 --> 02:06:02.900]   And here's something that since we're getting
[02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:05.160]   into the future of this area,
[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:11.700]   and while there is not direct published evidence yet,
[02:06:11.700 --> 02:06:14.260]   I think that is gonna be a fun area.
[02:06:14.260 --> 02:06:19.180]   So the gut as the brain
[02:06:19.180 --> 02:06:22.100]   also generates these electrical patterns.
[02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:25.260]   Those electrical patterns change
[02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:29.260]   depending on fasting versus feeding and circadian rhythms.
[02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:32.020]   Probably can realize jet lag.
[02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:34.420]   The gut is asking you for a burger at 3 a.m.,
[02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:37.260]   and your brain is telling the gut, you know,
[02:06:37.260 --> 02:06:38.960]   can you please go to sleep, right?
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:43.300]   So these electrical patterns,
[02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:45.820]   these electrical waves that are going into,
[02:06:45.820 --> 02:06:50.440]   that are being propagated by the gastrointestinal tract,
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:52.660]   there are like several different cells,
[02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:57.660]   like the enteric neurons are coordinating these cells.
[02:06:57.900 --> 02:07:02.660]   There are also these interstitial cells of Cajal.
[02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:05.580]   So Santiago Ramon Cajal.
[02:07:05.580 --> 02:07:07.500]   - The greatest neurobiologist of all time.
[02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:10.220]   - That's right, it was named after him.
[02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:13.460]   He actually has, I think it was like in the second volume
[02:07:13.460 --> 02:07:17.780]   of his classic book on the histology of the nervous system,
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:19.260]   one of the last figures talks about
[02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:22.020]   like the innervation of the villi in the intestine,
[02:07:22.020 --> 02:07:23.860]   some beautiful.
[02:07:23.860 --> 02:07:24.700]   - For those that don't know,
[02:07:24.700 --> 02:07:28.660]   Cajal shared the Nobel prize with Camillo Golgi in 1906.
[02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:31.420]   They together developed tools
[02:07:31.420 --> 02:07:34.460]   and mapped the structure of the nervous system.
[02:07:34.460 --> 02:07:36.980]   And it's fair to say that Cajal
[02:07:36.980 --> 02:07:40.980]   had supernatural levels of insight into the nervous system.
[02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:42.040]   He looked at the nervous systems
[02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:46.620]   of so many different animals in dead specimens.
[02:07:46.620 --> 02:07:51.420]   The joke, even though it's not funny,
[02:07:51.420 --> 02:07:54.340]   is that many animal species entered his laboratory,
[02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:56.040]   very few walked out.
[02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:58.580]   But by looking at fixed specimens under the microscope
[02:07:58.580 --> 02:08:02.100]   and then drawing them in select elements within them,
[02:08:02.100 --> 02:08:05.180]   essentially came up with most of the major hypotheses
[02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:06.740]   about how the nervous system works,
[02:08:06.740 --> 02:08:09.300]   not just its structure, but neuroplasticity,
[02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:12.320]   the failure of mammalian central nervous system neurons
[02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:13.160]   to regenerate.
[02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:15.200]   This is why after traumatic brain injury or stroke,
[02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:17.260]   there's often loss of function that doesn't recover.
[02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:18.300]   Sometimes it recovers.
[02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:21.340]   And that people who have injuries younger
[02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:23.580]   often can recover certain functions.
[02:08:23.580 --> 02:08:27.000]   Everything from the direction of electrical flow
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:27.840]   through the nervous system,
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:30.620]   all from looking at tissue that was not alive,
[02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:32.940]   no electrophysiology, no behavioral experiments,
[02:08:32.940 --> 02:08:37.940]   just raw, but incredible, supernatural,
[02:08:37.940 --> 02:08:41.660]   seemingly, levels of intuition and insight.
[02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:42.620]   Amazing.
[02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:45.580]   - Yes, there is some quote in one of his books
[02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:50.260]   that when he got invited to one of his friends to England,
[02:08:50.260 --> 02:08:54.060]   I don't remember, it was a famous neuroscientist
[02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:55.780]   at the time in the late 1800s
[02:08:55.780 --> 02:09:00.780]   who had helped him to expose his work to other audiences
[02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:03.960]   and invited him to England.
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:06.660]   So he said in there that it took like three months
[02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:08.620]   to go to that podcast, right?
[02:09:08.620 --> 02:09:09.820]   (laughs)
[02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:11.460]   It was a three-month trip.
[02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:15.820]   So he said that he brought his microscope.
[02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:17.020]   - With him. - With him.
[02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:19.100]   - Of course, that's very cool. - And in the room,
[02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:23.420]   he will be able to do some of these observations.
[02:09:23.420 --> 02:09:24.380]   - Yeah, peculiar guy,
[02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:28.300]   also known for carrying a very heavy iron umbrella
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:31.060]   in order to do physical exercise on the way to the lab.
[02:09:31.060 --> 02:09:34.260]   He was a very, very fit physical specimen.
[02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:39.260]   Also, reportedly, I don't know, pick which one,
[02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:45.420]   a pretty gruff person, not terribly pleasant to be around,
[02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:47.180]   ran a tight ship.
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:51.180]   But in any event, so the cells of the gut are named after,
[02:09:51.180 --> 02:09:52.660]   some of them are named after Cajal,
[02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:54.700]   interstitial cells of Cajal. - Cells of Cajal.
[02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:56.340]   - There, you just got a waltz
[02:09:56.340 --> 02:10:01.100]   into some neuroscience history, but critical history.
[02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:05.940]   - So they have this emanating electricity, right?
[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:10.940]   And so far, these, and it seems like the sphincters
[02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:14.460]   modulate the emanation of this electricity.
[02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:16.200]   - Oh, like an instrument. - Yeah.
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:20.840]   And you probably think like that is because the intestine,
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:24.120]   and maybe here we get a little bit even deeper into these.
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:29.120]   And I read some work from a philosopher in the UK,
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:33.800]   who was, and I'm gonna paraphrase it very largely,
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:35.200]   so please don't quote me,
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:37.840]   but it's something along the lines
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:40.320]   that if we are what we eat,
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:43.240]   the place where food becomes us and we become food
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:44.520]   should be the intestine, right?
[02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:48.920]   Because that is where food is actually absorbed, right?
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:51.760]   So that is a very fascinating point.
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:56.760]   Number two is that the food enters us at a frequency
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:11:00.560]   that it will modulate the entire body, right?
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:06.200]   Therefore, like the body through this electricity,
[02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:08.240]   these electrical waves should be in sync
[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:11.440]   with also the electricity of the entire nervous system.
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:14.000]   So I think that here's where in the future,
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.440]   I think that there's gonna be a fascinating realm
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:19.520]   of understanding how it is that these waves
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:24.520]   of the body and the brain are synchronized with each other.
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:27.520]   Because as we know, like for instance,
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:31.440]   sometimes when we don't, we are hungry,
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:36.240]   we become hangry, you know, like we become irritated
[02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:38.120]   by the fact that we don't have food,
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:40.480]   and perhaps it's this dissonance
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:42.640]   in the emanation of the electrical waves
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:45.760]   between the digestive tract and the nervous system.
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:49.960]   So I think that that is just like one of the realms
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:55.360]   of how it is that the brain is connected to the gut
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:12:00.080]   at a more organ to organ level
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:02.760]   to be able to make us function ultimately, right?
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:07.760]   Because that's how we are integrating the outside world,
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:09.960]   the food, into our entire system
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:12.960]   so we can maintain the entire organism.
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:15.120]   - Well, certainly our level of alertness
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:18.040]   is linked to our level of anticipation,
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:20.760]   and a lot of our food anticipation
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:26.560]   impacts our levels of arousal, aka alertness.
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:30.000]   So as you mentioned, we're a diurnal species,
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.560]   so in the middle of the night, it's unusual to get hungry,
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:35.480]   right, a lot of these pathways are shut down,
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:37.480]   digestion is happening at different rates,
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:40.120]   and typically our appetite is greater during the day
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:42.120]   than it is in the middle of the night.
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:43.240]   - That's right.
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:46.960]   - But in addition to that, it makes good sense to me
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:50.440]   that what is going on at the level of our gut
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:53.080]   is going to tell the brain,
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:55.520]   did we get enough nutrients from the previous day?
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:58.400]   Are we in a place of abundance?
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:01.440]   There's also the psychological aspect of gut sensing,
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:03.720]   and we haven't really touched on that.
[02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:05.680]   What are your thoughts as both a scientist
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:08.560]   and a human with a gut-brain axis
[02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:11.100]   on this notion of kind of gut intuition?
[02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:13.520]   You meet certain people, and it sort of relaxes
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:15.520]   and warms you, and you want to get to know them more.
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:19.480]   Other people, for whatever reason, you just feel like,
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:21.240]   I don't know, something doesn't feel quite right,
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:24.200]   that we can sense things at the level of the body
[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:25.840]   that inform our brain,
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:30.600]   and no one really understands that process yet,
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:32.560]   but we do know that the vagus nerve,
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:37.560]   which is a multi-pronged pathway, big pathway,
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:39.760]   it's probably its own major branch
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:41.760]   of the nervous system, really,
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:44.160]   is sending bidirectional communication
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:45.920]   between brain and body,
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:48.680]   and presumably, when we're around somebody
[02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:51.240]   or something that doesn't quote-unquote feel right,
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:53.600]   the vagus is involved.
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:59.200]   - A few interesting things in that area.
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:02.840]   I mean, in the work of Carl Jung talks about it,
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:05.440]   about the subconscious and how it is
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:07.760]   that we are accumulating all of these experiences
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:10.800]   that we have been passing through in life
[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:12.680]   is not that they are not a story anymore,
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:15.200]   it's just that they are back in the subconscious,
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:16.880]   and then, ultimately, they become part
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:20.120]   of this so-called intuition.
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:22.760]   We have this gut feeling that...
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:32.280]   We analyze some of the languages.
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:34.560]   I think that in the past,
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:36.920]   people have told me in so many different languages
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:40.320]   that there is this phrase for gut feelings in so many,
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:42.280]   like, for instance, I think in Portuguese,
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:44.280]   it's "frio de barriga," you know?
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:48.280]   Like, it's cold in the stomach.
[02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:49.320]   You get a cold.
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:53.800]   In Spanish, we call it a "presentimiento,"
[02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:56.720]   like a pre-feeling, you know?
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:14:59.640]   Or, yeah, pre-sensation or feeling.
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:02.360]   It would be more feeling if you translate that.
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:04.480]   - As if it arrives first.
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:07.640]   - Yes, before you're able to articulate it, right?
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:10.600]   So, there is this storage in the entire body
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:13.560]   that gives you, like, depending on the context,
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:17.200]   it gives you a certain type of feeling, right?
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:20.680]   And that's why we talk about intuition.
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:24.520]   There is also, like, this other aspect
[02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:29.200]   of how it is that food
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:34.680]   synchronizes that intuition.
[02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:39.640]   It seems to synchronize that intuition
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:41.960]   among two or more people.
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:44.080]   'Cause if you think about it,
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:48.800]   we have this ritualistic way of serving something
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:52.200]   when we commonly say, or colloquially say,
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:53.680]   let's go for a cup of coffee.
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:56.920]   And often what we mean is let's go and talk about business,
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:15:59.200]   the future, resolve an issue.
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:00.600]   But we're talking about the cup of coffee
[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:02.080]   and we have to share.
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:04.040]   And people, I think that there are some psychologists
[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:06.720]   that have run some of these studies
[02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:10.560]   in which they say that if the food that we eat
[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:13.280]   is more alike, we are more likely to connect,
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:15.160]   at least on the moment, right?
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:16.680]   So, there is this aspect.
[02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:19.320]   And that's why we share, you know, the food.
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:20.160]   - Interesting.
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:22.640]   So, is the idea that it's the actual chemical constituents
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:25.640]   of the food that's creating a common experience
[02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:28.200]   that then allows people to bond more readily?
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:33.200]   Or is it that the specific constituents of the food
[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:36.600]   are actually driving bonding per se?
[02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:37.440]   I mean, it- - Yeah.
[02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:40.600]   And we go back to, if we are what we eat,
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:42.040]   then if we eat the same thing,
[02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:45.240]   we should be more alike to each other, right?
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:47.920]   That's why, you know, like in communities,
[02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:48.960]   you share the food.
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:53.960]   In fact, in like, if you go into certain specific communities
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:58.520]   you pass around the food, you pass around the drinks,
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:02.280]   you know, and it's very common to share, right?
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:04.880]   - Yeah, and certainly in romantic bonding,
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:06.520]   there are many factors, of course,
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:11.520]   but the kind of more basic functions of food, sex, and sleep
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:17.960]   represent the common places of bonding initially, right?
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:20.660]   And conversation, of course, and values, et cetera, right?
[02:17:20.660 --> 02:17:23.160]   Not to dismiss any of those, they're essential as well.
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:27.280]   But in terms of, you know, feelings of safety.
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:28.120]   - That's right.
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:32.600]   - Feelings of communing with somebody, right?
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:35.880]   These very basic biological functions.
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:37.520]   - Yeah, and in business too, right?
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:39.760]   Like people, there has been a study
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:42.080]   in like behavioral economists.
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:44.040]   They talk about how it is that business
[02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:47.080]   are more likely to happen when they are like made over food
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:48.600]   or launch or things like that, right?
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:51.280]   Like there's this synchronicity in the decision making.
[02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:56.400]   And here is a third dimension in this area
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:59.600]   that it has not been well explored,
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:01.720]   but I suspect that in the near future
[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:03.960]   it will begin to be explored.
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:08.960]   I read a while ago a very elegant paper from Walter Cannon.
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:16.320]   So you may want to expand on who Walter Cannon was,
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:21.320]   but one of the founding figures
[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:23.760]   of the study of physiology.
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:25.360]   - Yeah, autonomic physiology.
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:26.720]   - Autonomic physiology, right?
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:30.980]   Chair of physiology at Harvard in 1920s, 1930s.
[02:18:30.980 --> 02:18:35.660]   Author of "The Wisdom of the Body."
[02:18:35.660 --> 02:18:40.520]   He has a paper, or he published a paper,
[02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:44.160]   I believe in the 1930s.
[02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:47.040]   It's called "Voodoo Death."
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:49.760]   Voodoo Death.
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:51.560]   And I remember when I found that title,
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:56.360]   I was like, ooh, this is something to sit down and dissect.
[02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:57.200]   - Yeah, good title.
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:18:58.020]   - Good title.
[02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:00.080]   - If you want somebody to read it, good title.
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:02.480]   - And he essentially, the gist of it,
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:06.080]   let me see if I can do a little bit of justice,
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:08.520]   but obviously I will chop most of the details.
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:13.520]   But the gist of the paper is that
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:17.120]   in some observations, in some native tribes,
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:19.500]   I believe it was in Africa,
[02:19:19.500 --> 02:19:25.680]   that if young people, especially young, youngsters,
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:34.000]   if they were frightened by a shaman
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.920]   that they will not perform a certain thing,
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:38.800]   a certain task, right?
[02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:43.880]   They enter a level of psychosis, so to speak,
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:48.880]   that could cause death, like the custom spell, right?
[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:52.720]   And that's why it's called Voodoo Death.
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:56.440]   What Cannon goes and describes is there is an activation
[02:19:56.440 --> 02:19:59.920]   of the vagus nerve and the peripheral nervous system
[02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:02.520]   that is a hyperactivation that is going
[02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:05.560]   through the sub-threshold level of consciousness.
[02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:08.560]   And in some of these tribes,
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:12.000]   at least that's what he explains that is happening.
[02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.080]   And I believe that he did some experiments in some animals.
[02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:18.320]   But what he was saying is that there's a hypertonic
[02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:20.480]   activation of the peripheral nervous system
[02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:24.400]   when there are these spells that are casted
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:27.560]   by a member of the tribe that is in a higher
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:31.480]   or more superior or more influential position.
[02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:34.880]   That if the other member,
[02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:37.280]   especially if it is paired with something, right?
[02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:40.960]   Like if you say, like, if you go outside
[02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:43.520]   and don't listen to what I just told you
[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:48.520]   and you see a black cat, those two things match together
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:50.640]   and now you're hyperactivated, right?
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:52.320]   And become superstitious about it.
[02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:55.280]   But it is, what Walter Cannon goes to explain
[02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:56.760]   is there is a hyperactivation
[02:20:56.760 --> 02:20:58.000]   of the peripheral nervous system.
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.960]   Obviously, there's probably more details in there.
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:05.760]   But the paper really highlights an area of exploration
[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:06.680]   that we don't know about.
[02:21:06.680 --> 02:21:10.640]   There's a threshold of subconsciousness
[02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:12.720]   of the nervous system, how it is driving us
[02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:17.720]   to have superstition, to drive instinctively
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:21.320]   to go and consume certain things
[02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:24.400]   or behave in certain ways, right?
[02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:28.080]   - Yeah, so it sounds like it's paired association learning
[02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:30.080]   through statements, cognition,
[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:31.800]   but that's enacted through the vagus
[02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:34.880]   in order to control the organs of their periphery.
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:38.240]   That's nerd speak for if we hear and believe
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:41.360]   that certain events will cause certain changes
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:45.400]   in our physiology, they can, in some instances,
[02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:46.760]   become capable of that.
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:49.880]   Eat this food at this location and you'll get sick.
[02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:52.120]   Eat this food at this location, you'll feel better.
[02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:52.960]   - That's correct.
[02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:54.400]   - And it's learned association.
[02:21:54.400 --> 02:21:56.400]   And ultimately it's physiological,
[02:21:56.400 --> 02:22:00.180]   but it sounds like it's subject to a lot of learning effects.
[02:22:00.180 --> 02:22:01.480]   As long as we're talking about the vagus,
[02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:04.500]   I think it's a great opportunity to just mention
[02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:07.240]   that a lot of people understandably think
[02:22:07.240 --> 02:22:09.120]   that the vagus nerve activation
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:11.600]   is always about calming of the nervous system.
[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:15.800]   And indeed, the vagus is placed under the umbrella
[02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:18.720]   of a parasympathetic pathway.
[02:22:18.720 --> 02:22:21.200]   But I think it's very important for people to know
[02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:24.400]   that both experimentally and clinically,
[02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:26.360]   if the vagus nerve is stimulated,
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:28.320]   you get exactly the opposite effect.
[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:30.320]   You get arousal effects.
[02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:32.840]   This is commonly known in labs
[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:36.060]   that do physiology of different kinds.
[02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:37.460]   It's in the clinical context,
[02:22:37.460 --> 02:22:39.460]   people with depression are sometimes treated
[02:22:39.460 --> 02:22:41.420]   with vagal nerve stimulators,
[02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:43.420]   and it certainly isn't driving more sedation,
[02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:45.380]   more depression of the nervous system.
[02:22:45.380 --> 02:22:47.460]   It drives alertness and arousal.
[02:22:47.460 --> 02:22:50.820]   So we have to, I think, make sure that we look
[02:22:50.820 --> 02:22:54.780]   at the vagus system and describe the vagal pathway
[02:22:54.780 --> 02:22:58.140]   as one that can both induce states of calm,
[02:22:58.140 --> 02:22:59.820]   of ease, rest, and digest,
[02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:00.740]   as it's sometimes called,
[02:23:00.740 --> 02:23:04.680]   but also states of arousal and alertness, even fear.
[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:07.820]   And so I think of the vagus as a superhighway
[02:23:07.820 --> 02:23:09.220]   of a bunch of different pathways
[02:23:09.220 --> 02:23:10.640]   with lots of inputs and outputs
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:12.740]   that's highly subject to learning.
[02:23:12.740 --> 02:23:16.020]   And indeed, the vagus can slow heart rate,
[02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:17.840]   you know, down through a number of things
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:19.540]   like long exhale breathing.
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:21.500]   Earlier, we were talking about stress modulation,
[02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:23.280]   something my labs worked on.
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:26.900]   Extend your exhales, that's the most basic way.
[02:23:26.900 --> 02:23:28.380]   Physiological size, two inhales
[02:23:28.380 --> 02:23:30.980]   followed by a full exhale to lungs empty.
[02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:33.180]   These are core physiological mechanisms
[02:23:33.180 --> 02:23:35.240]   known to activate the vagus and lead to calming.
[02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:37.620]   But the vagus, I look at the vagus
[02:23:37.620 --> 02:23:42.140]   as kind of including both an accelerator of sorts,
[02:23:42.140 --> 02:23:45.940]   accelerator-based pathways in terms of arousal and breaks.
[02:23:45.940 --> 02:23:50.480]   And probably our basal level of vagal activation
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:52.660]   reflects sort of the RPM of our system.
[02:23:52.660 --> 02:23:54.900]   How much, are we calm?
[02:23:54.900 --> 02:23:57.660]   Are we humming at a higher level of activity?
[02:23:57.660 --> 02:23:59.340]   - Such an interesting pathway,
[02:23:59.340 --> 02:24:01.020]   such an interesting area of the nervous system.
[02:24:01.020 --> 02:24:04.260]   And we don't really understand yet.
[02:24:04.260 --> 02:24:05.100]   - No, because like-
[02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:07.940]   - Even the major branches and pathways
[02:24:07.940 --> 02:24:11.480]   are just now finally beginning to be understood.
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:16.980]   We're on virgin beaches.
[02:24:16.980 --> 02:24:19.780]   - Yes, and right now that I hear you
[02:24:19.780 --> 02:24:21.380]   bringing up the humming, for instance,
[02:24:21.380 --> 02:24:23.100]   there is a branch of the vagus
[02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:27.100]   that innervates the ear, the inner ear, you know?
[02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:28.860]   And that's why it is believed,
[02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:31.140]   and I think that there is a little bit of evidence out there
[02:24:31.140 --> 02:24:33.940]   that how it is certain music at a certain frequency
[02:24:33.940 --> 02:24:36.940]   will calm you down because it is immediately like,
[02:24:36.940 --> 02:24:41.940]   brings the, it starts to make the vagus vibrate
[02:24:41.940 --> 02:24:43.800]   at a certain frequency.
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:47.280]   - Yeah, and humming has been linked to vasodilation,
[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:49.700]   which is associated with a calming effect,
[02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:52.340]   whereas activation of the sympathetic arm
[02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:53.620]   or the autonomic nervous system,
[02:24:53.620 --> 02:24:55.820]   or the kind of what sometimes is referred to
[02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:58.180]   as fight or flight, but it's involved in other things,
[02:24:58.180 --> 02:24:59.780]   causes vasoconstriction.
[02:24:59.780 --> 02:25:00.620]   - And if you think about it,
[02:25:00.620 --> 02:25:02.860]   like in several religious practices,
[02:25:02.860 --> 02:25:04.620]   there is the humming, right?
[02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:07.700]   There is the singing, there is the sound,
[02:25:07.700 --> 02:25:09.460]   the sound plays a big role.
[02:25:09.460 --> 02:25:11.420]   In running, there is a certain frequency
[02:25:11.420 --> 02:25:13.900]   that makes you run, calms you more
[02:25:13.900 --> 02:25:15.780]   and makes you run better, you know?
[02:25:15.780 --> 02:25:16.620]   - Is that right?
[02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:19.580]   - Yeah, there is some evidence, at least among runners,
[02:25:19.580 --> 02:25:22.540]   that they prefer a certain type of frequency
[02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:24.100]   for the running, right?
[02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:27.260]   So a certain pace of running or breathing.
[02:25:27.260 --> 02:25:30.300]   - And the sound, specifically the sound.
[02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:31.300]   - The sound of their feet.
[02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:33.060]   - Yeah, no, the sound of the music,
[02:25:33.060 --> 02:25:36.660]   like if you play a certain music, right?
[02:25:36.660 --> 02:25:38.540]   And probably the sound of their feet too, right?
[02:25:38.540 --> 02:25:41.340]   Like it's just, it has not been explored, right?
[02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:43.380]   - It's fascinating.
[02:25:43.380 --> 02:25:45.660]   And you know, so much of what I think about
[02:25:45.660 --> 02:25:46.940]   when I think about the nervous system
[02:25:46.940 --> 02:25:49.900]   is the fine grain processing of, you know,
[02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:51.460]   of color, of light or what,
[02:25:51.460 --> 02:25:53.760]   but when it comes to our feelings of wellbeing,
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:56.660]   our levels of arousal, sleep, et cetera,
[02:25:56.660 --> 02:25:59.420]   it's the rather, I don't want to call them crude
[02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:00.800]   because they're really sophisticated.
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:01.980]   They evolved to be sophisticated,
[02:26:01.980 --> 02:26:04.660]   but these kind of macroscopic signals
[02:26:04.660 --> 02:26:07.180]   like light coming in in the morning
[02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:10.020]   has these, you know, long wavelength
[02:26:10.020 --> 02:26:12.020]   and short wavelength contrast.
[02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:14.740]   That's what tells our brain it's morning.
[02:26:14.740 --> 02:26:15.580]   - That's right.
[02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:17.260]   - It's the orange, red, blue contrast.
[02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:18.340]   Even if there's cloud cover,
[02:26:18.340 --> 02:26:20.660]   it's the difference between those two
[02:26:22.060 --> 02:26:25.200]   different qualities of light that says it's morning.
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:26.600]   And when the sun is overhead,
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:28.560]   you don't see that yellow, blue,
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:30.680]   or orange, blue, red, blue contrast,
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:32.680]   but you see it again at sunset and it informs.
[02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:35.620]   So it sounds like the combination
[02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:38.800]   of specific chemicals in the gut tell us this is good.
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:39.640]   Pursue more of this.
[02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:43.240]   And maybe even the place where you found it is a good place
[02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:45.840]   as opposed to, and the opposite is probably also true.
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:46.680]   - Yes.
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:50.660]   Like that's an entire new domain of the digestive,
[02:26:50.660 --> 02:26:53.680]   the sensory system in the digestive tract
[02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:56.680]   that we haven't even begin to articulate yet.
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:00.600]   Memory.
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:03.640]   How do we remember, like what was that first meal?
[02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:06.800]   Like in the Ratatouille movie (laughs)
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:08.200]   from when we were children, right?
[02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:11.560]   Like it was very different, like I still remember
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:14.760]   like some of the very simple, humble meals
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:15.880]   that my mother would make,
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:17.840]   but it's just priceless for me, right?
[02:27:19.100 --> 02:27:22.100]   Whenever I go home, it's like I especially,
[02:27:22.100 --> 02:27:23.580]   without asking sometimes,
[02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:26.860]   my mother will prepare those for me
[02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:30.060]   and it's like, it just brings you back
[02:27:30.060 --> 02:27:32.300]   when you were that age, right?
[02:27:32.300 --> 02:27:34.100]   - Yeah, the memory system is tightly linked
[02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:35.940]   to taste and smell.
[02:27:35.940 --> 02:27:37.220]   There's no question about it.
[02:27:37.220 --> 02:27:39.720]   - And then like how it is that the gut triggers
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:44.620]   those sensations or farther reinforces those sensations.
[02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:46.860]   We haven't even begin to articulate.
[02:27:46.860 --> 02:27:48.140]   And when I said articulate,
[02:27:48.140 --> 02:27:50.020]   because we don't even have the language
[02:27:50.020 --> 02:27:52.660]   to refer to these things, you know?
[02:27:52.660 --> 02:27:54.420]   That's why at the very beginning we were talking
[02:27:54.420 --> 02:27:57.820]   over there in our conversations about the axis, you know?
[02:27:57.820 --> 02:28:02.140]   And that we don't say like the nose brain axis, right?
[02:28:02.140 --> 02:28:05.700]   Like we just went for what we had at that time.
[02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:08.100]   And I do think that the language will continue to evolve
[02:28:08.100 --> 02:28:11.860]   for us to be able to articulate more precisely,
[02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:15.260]   more richly, more elegant, more, you know,
[02:28:15.260 --> 02:28:18.340]   in so many different ways, how it is that
[02:28:18.340 --> 02:28:23.340]   the organs communicate with each other
[02:28:23.340 --> 02:28:25.220]   to make us who we are.
[02:28:25.220 --> 02:28:29.060]   And in there, in one of our papers,
[02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:32.740]   we quoted these beautiful passages
[02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:37.240]   from the book, "Memoirs of a Stomach."
[02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:41.340]   It was written in 1853--
[02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:43.660]   - By a French person?
[02:28:43.660 --> 02:28:46.820]   - By, what it says in the first page,
[02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:48.740]   by the minister of interior,
[02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:52.060]   because all of those who eat may read
[02:28:52.060 --> 02:28:53.460]   or something like that.
[02:28:53.460 --> 02:28:55.900]   And then on page 21, it goes to describe
[02:28:55.900 --> 02:28:58.140]   the dialogue between the gut and the brain.
[02:28:58.140 --> 02:29:00.460]   And it says like that, how it is that the gut
[02:29:00.460 --> 02:29:03.900]   communicates to the brain with a rapidity
[02:29:03.900 --> 02:29:08.180]   through these two sets of electrical wires
[02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:12.260]   that communicate the arrivals of the day,
[02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:16.300]   as we may eat, with a precision and rapidity
[02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:19.140]   to the brain, so the brain will make
[02:29:19.140 --> 02:29:22.700]   its own feelings and impressions.
[02:29:22.700 --> 02:29:27.500]   And then he said that when,
[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:30.060]   he's talking from the perspective of the stomach,
[02:29:30.060 --> 02:29:33.980]   it says like, when I grew morose,
[02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:37.180]   like meaning I'm not working in digestion,
[02:29:37.180 --> 02:29:40.900]   then the brain also grew irritable and petulant.
[02:29:40.900 --> 02:29:42.460]   - Hangry. - Hangry.
[02:29:42.460 --> 02:29:45.500]   - It's so interesting to look at human experience
[02:29:45.500 --> 02:29:47.960]   from the directionality of gut to brain
[02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:50.180]   rather than brain to gut.
[02:29:50.180 --> 02:29:51.380]   - That's right.
[02:29:51.380 --> 02:29:55.780]   - And as I do from time to time,
[02:29:55.780 --> 02:29:58.580]   pay attention to what's happening in the landscape
[02:29:58.580 --> 02:30:01.980]   of wellness and mental health and physical health,
[02:30:01.980 --> 02:30:06.480]   a lot of what you see out there
[02:30:06.480 --> 02:30:09.580]   in terms of highly educated people
[02:30:09.580 --> 02:30:12.580]   who have thought very deeply about how to navigate
[02:30:12.580 --> 02:30:15.340]   decision-making in lots of different domains of life
[02:30:15.340 --> 02:30:17.140]   and to do it in a way that really honors
[02:30:17.140 --> 02:30:20.780]   our own individual preferences and needs.
[02:30:20.780 --> 02:30:22.020]   People like Martha Beck,
[02:30:22.020 --> 02:30:22.980]   I don't know if you've heard of her,
[02:30:22.980 --> 02:30:26.120]   but she exists in the, she has triple degreed from Harvard,
[02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:32.220]   but has talked a lot about learning to sense one's way
[02:30:32.220 --> 02:30:36.620]   into and through decisions through intuition
[02:30:36.620 --> 02:30:38.460]   that is more of the body
[02:30:38.460 --> 02:30:42.060]   and is more of particular brain circuits
[02:30:42.060 --> 02:30:46.340]   than our analytic, like pros and cons lists,
[02:30:46.340 --> 02:30:47.620]   because pros and cons lists,
[02:30:47.620 --> 02:30:50.640]   and obviously important metrics like objective metrics,
[02:30:50.640 --> 02:30:52.900]   like, oh, is this the right salary, the right location,
[02:30:52.900 --> 02:30:56.620]   the right, all the things that matter for decision-making,
[02:30:56.620 --> 02:30:59.860]   and we're trained in that in school in the United States
[02:30:59.860 --> 02:31:03.980]   and in many areas of the world as well, of course,
[02:31:03.980 --> 02:31:05.180]   and that's critical,
[02:31:05.180 --> 02:31:06.620]   but that there's this other training,
[02:31:06.620 --> 02:31:08.260]   there's this other learning of self
[02:31:08.260 --> 02:31:09.460]   that can be extremely useful,
[02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:13.480]   and it almost always comes back to body first,
[02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:15.460]   then to cognition and decision-making,
[02:31:15.460 --> 02:31:18.980]   and I feel like modern humans are trying to learn
[02:31:18.980 --> 02:31:23.580]   how to run the analysis of life decision-making
[02:31:23.580 --> 02:31:28.460]   through this, I guess, more ancient axis,
[02:31:28.460 --> 02:31:30.740]   so the, again, the intelligence of these,
[02:31:30.740 --> 02:31:33.080]   what used to be called more primitive systems,
[02:31:33.080 --> 02:31:34.820]   but I don't think they're primitive at all,
[02:31:34.820 --> 02:31:35.860]   and talking with you today,
[02:31:35.860 --> 02:31:39.100]   it's clear to me that these are highly sophisticated systems,
[02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:41.780]   just as sophisticated as any forebrain pathway
[02:31:41.780 --> 02:31:45.980]   involved in analyzing, say, like probability or something.
[02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:47.820]   - And that's why I like to highlight
[02:31:47.820 --> 02:31:54.140]   the example of having a nice meal
[02:31:54.140 --> 02:31:58.100]   and having a nice conversation at the same time.
[02:31:58.100 --> 02:31:59.820]   You know, if you go to a nice restaurant
[02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:00.900]   and you have a nice meal
[02:32:00.900 --> 02:32:03.340]   while you're having a nice conversation,
[02:32:03.340 --> 02:32:05.600]   and you pay attention to it,
[02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:07.780]   then it brings humility to your body
[02:32:07.780 --> 02:32:10.600]   to know how much your body's doing
[02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:13.820]   for you to be able to just express a tiny little bit
[02:32:13.820 --> 02:32:17.340]   and having some sort of highly intellectual,
[02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:19.420]   sophisticated conversation
[02:32:19.420 --> 02:32:22.940]   while you're able to put in the precise amount
[02:32:22.940 --> 02:32:25.060]   of lettuce inside of your mouth
[02:32:25.060 --> 02:32:27.220]   and chew it in the right way,
[02:32:27.220 --> 02:32:29.940]   and adjust it with a little bit of water
[02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:31.520]   and maybe a little bit of wine
[02:32:31.520 --> 02:32:33.620]   and understand what is cleansing your palate
[02:32:33.620 --> 02:32:37.020]   and like, you know, putting down the napkin
[02:32:37.020 --> 02:32:38.940]   and so on and so forth
[02:32:38.940 --> 02:32:40.340]   without going to the restroom
[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:43.300]   every time that you feel like going to it, right?
[02:32:43.300 --> 02:32:46.420]   There is an entire sophistication of the body
[02:32:46.420 --> 02:32:48.100]   just to have something like as simple
[02:32:48.100 --> 02:32:51.580]   as a catch-up conversation, you know?
[02:32:51.580 --> 02:32:53.020]   - Do you think that our ability
[02:32:53.020 --> 02:32:56.160]   to sense into gut sensing more,
[02:32:56.160 --> 02:33:01.100]   to really hear and respond to the signals
[02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:03.740]   from the gut is something that we can learn
[02:33:03.740 --> 02:33:06.620]   even as adults, simply by paying more attention?
[02:33:06.620 --> 02:33:09.460]   - Yes, and I think that here's the concept
[02:33:09.460 --> 02:33:12.060]   that usually, you know,
[02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:15.940]   that when we talk about topics like meditation,
[02:33:15.940 --> 02:33:17.300]   you know, is that self-care,
[02:33:17.300 --> 02:33:20.660]   and that self-care is listening to your own body, right?
[02:33:20.660 --> 02:33:23.180]   How it is that the body is feeling.
[02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:24.620]   Like, I don't know, you know,
[02:33:24.620 --> 02:33:27.700]   I grew up in a, my mother will tell me like,
[02:33:27.700 --> 02:33:29.940]   or, you know, family will tell you,
[02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:31.840]   if you feel like going to the restroom
[02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:36.740]   to pee for a bio break, don't hold it for too long
[02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:38.100]   because it might be bad, right?
[02:33:38.100 --> 02:33:40.420]   Like, and I think that just learning that part
[02:33:40.420 --> 02:33:43.980]   of like listening to the body is an essential aspect.
[02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:46.220]   It's just that we're not constantly doing it
[02:33:46.220 --> 02:33:49.980]   over learning about how we are moving our career forward.
[02:33:49.980 --> 02:33:51.540]   - Yeah, so much of what we're taught
[02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:56.100]   in order to be high-achieving and forward-moving in life
[02:33:56.100 --> 02:33:59.140]   in modern culture is about learning
[02:33:59.140 --> 02:34:01.540]   to override the signals from the body,
[02:34:01.540 --> 02:34:04.420]   but it seems that learning to listen
[02:34:04.420 --> 02:34:05.580]   to the signals from the body
[02:34:05.580 --> 02:34:08.340]   is key to being a healthy human being.
[02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:10.460]   - Yes, and here I have an example.
[02:34:10.460 --> 02:34:13.020]   Years ago, I used to run quite a bit,
[02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:18.500]   and I remember that after I had run a marathon,
[02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:21.660]   I took a break for like a few weeks,
[02:34:21.660 --> 02:34:24.420]   and then I got back on the trail and I began running,
[02:34:24.420 --> 02:34:25.420]   and I was like, you know,
[02:34:25.420 --> 02:34:27.860]   I don't need to warm up for three or four weeks
[02:34:27.860 --> 02:34:30.340]   up to like get back into speed, right?
[02:34:30.340 --> 02:34:32.860]   And I remember that I started to feel like
[02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:36.980]   that my right, the soul of my right foot
[02:34:36.980 --> 02:34:38.500]   was a little bit like bothering me,
[02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:41.300]   like almost imperceptible.
[02:34:41.300 --> 02:34:45.740]   And I was like, no, you just have to keep going, you know?
[02:34:45.740 --> 02:34:47.900]   My wife Elaine told me like, you know,
[02:34:47.900 --> 02:34:50.020]   you should pay attention, take a break, you know?
[02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:51.340]   And I just kept running.
[02:34:51.340 --> 02:34:54.100]   And I remember specifically that one time I went to run
[02:34:54.100 --> 02:34:56.980]   and said like, I can put in 80 miles
[02:34:56.980 --> 02:34:59.180]   that I think that I was running at like seven minutes,
[02:34:59.180 --> 02:35:01.980]   7.15 a mile or something like that.
[02:35:01.980 --> 02:35:03.860]   And I began running.
[02:35:03.860 --> 02:35:07.300]   And then I, after a mile, I was feeling pumped, you know?
[02:35:07.300 --> 02:35:09.660]   I had two miles, three miles, I was like,
[02:35:09.660 --> 02:35:12.140]   and then I usually will go and do four miles
[02:35:12.140 --> 02:35:14.220]   and then turn around and come back.
[02:35:14.220 --> 02:35:18.380]   I got on mile four and I felt crack,
[02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:20.700]   and I could not walk anymore.
[02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:23.780]   There was a hair fracture
[02:35:23.780 --> 02:35:26.460]   that is almost imperceptible in an X-ray,
[02:35:26.460 --> 02:35:29.420]   but boy, you cannot move your foot anymore.
[02:35:29.420 --> 02:35:32.700]   I had to limp for four miles all the way back to the car
[02:35:32.700 --> 02:35:35.500]   because I didn't even have my phone.
[02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:39.220]   And I never forgot that for next time,
[02:35:39.220 --> 02:35:40.820]   you gotta pay attention to your body, you know?
[02:35:40.820 --> 02:35:42.340]   Your body is simply telling you
[02:35:42.340 --> 02:35:45.900]   like something is a little bit off,
[02:35:45.900 --> 02:35:47.860]   just don't keep pushing it, you know?
[02:35:47.860 --> 02:35:50.460]   And I specifically remember because I kept running
[02:35:50.460 --> 02:35:53.660]   and I couldn't, I had to literally limp
[02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:55.980]   all the way back to the car, you know?
[02:35:55.980 --> 02:36:00.540]   - Well, Diego, I must say that among the many things
[02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:02.740]   that you've shared with us today and taught us
[02:36:02.740 --> 02:36:05.980]   about the gut and its ability to influence the brain
[02:36:05.980 --> 02:36:07.820]   and the incredible things that are happening
[02:36:07.820 --> 02:36:10.580]   at the level of biology and physiology of the gut,
[02:36:10.580 --> 02:36:16.200]   chief among them is the message
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:18.900]   that we should all pay more attention
[02:36:18.900 --> 02:36:21.820]   to our sensing at the level of our gut.
[02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:24.800]   And nowadays we hear so much about the gut microbiome
[02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:25.960]   such that fortunately,
[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:27.620]   I think most people are starting to appreciate
[02:36:27.620 --> 02:36:31.820]   that the gut microbiome is vital for all aspects of health
[02:36:31.820 --> 02:36:32.900]   and that there are things that we can do
[02:36:32.900 --> 02:36:34.780]   to feed that microbiome, fiber intake,
[02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:36.980]   fermented food intake and so forth.
[02:36:36.980 --> 02:36:39.900]   But clearly based on what you've told us today
[02:36:39.900 --> 02:36:42.680]   that even just paying a little bit more attention
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:47.680]   to what our gut is telling us at the level of feeling good,
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:49.980]   feeling less good,
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:54.920]   'cause the signs and signals are subtle, I realize,
[02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:57.400]   can really help us make better decisions
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:01.700]   and help us decide not just what foods to eat or not eat,
[02:37:01.700 --> 02:37:03.060]   how much to eat or not eat,
[02:37:03.060 --> 02:37:07.120]   but also how to navigate higher order decisions,
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:10.280]   if you will, about who to spend time with,
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:11.880]   what to do, what not to do,
[02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:15.120]   moving along the decision tree of life.
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:17.240]   And along those lines,
[02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:19.200]   I want to thank you for making the decision
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:20.740]   to come here today.
[02:37:20.740 --> 02:37:24.180]   I certainly am happy that we decided to do it.
[02:37:24.180 --> 02:37:26.020]   It's something that's been a long time coming.
[02:37:26.020 --> 02:37:28.500]   I really see you as one of the true pioneers in this area
[02:37:28.500 --> 02:37:31.380]   of trying to dissect the understanding
[02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:32.660]   of the gut brain axis,
[02:37:32.660 --> 02:37:34.340]   heal the brain through the gut,
[02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:37.180]   understand and modulate our emotions
[02:37:37.180 --> 02:37:38.820]   at the level of gut sensing.
[02:37:38.820 --> 02:37:41.860]   And while there are other researchers in this area,
[02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:44.240]   I refer to you as a pioneer
[02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:47.260]   because you've really undergone this incredible trajectory
[02:37:47.260 --> 02:37:51.240]   from the Amazon through nutrition science into neuroscience.
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:52.860]   And now we're getting a little bit
[02:37:52.860 --> 02:37:54.280]   into psychological science.
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:56.260]   And I'm excited for what comes next.
[02:37:56.260 --> 02:37:58.280]   I only ask one thing,
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:01.400]   which is that as you make these discoveries,
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:03.700]   that you come back and talk to us about them
[02:38:03.700 --> 02:38:07.240]   so that we can learn more about your incredible work.
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:10.020]   - So, Andrew, I want to say a few things.
[02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:12.440]   The first thing is that I feel deeply honored
[02:38:12.440 --> 02:38:14.120]   by your invitation.
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:17.200]   And thank you so much for the opportunity.
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:20.560]   I am just simply a representative
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:25.040]   of the people that work with me
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:28.200]   and work with us.
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:30.440]   You know, I'm just an ambassador
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:33.280]   and they get the majority of the credit
[02:38:33.280 --> 02:38:37.160]   for their dedication to help us understand
[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:40.320]   a little bit more of the body
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:42.800]   and how it has helped us to navigate the world
[02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:44.240]   that we live in.
[02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:47.740]   So I want to thank you for the opportunity.
[02:38:47.740 --> 02:38:51.280]   I want to thank the people that have made this possible.
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:53.960]   Also, like the people that are along the way
[02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:56.560]   or the institutions that are along the way
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:39:01.560]   have helped fund these endeavor.
[02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:05.600]   You know, my home institution at Duke,
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:08.680]   I'm deeply grateful because my career has developed there.
[02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:13.640]   And some of my mentors, Roger Little, Andrew Muir,
[02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:16.560]   and the people that have helped me along the way.
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:21.560]   And then finally, I want to thank you and your team
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:25.000]   and congratulate you for the work that you do
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.560]   and that you have created this window
[02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:30.440]   for us to come and share with the public
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:33.660]   some of the, a little bit of the work that we do.
[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:39.800]   Perhaps some of that is obviously is based on evidence.
[02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:44.540]   Some portion of that is thinking about the future,
[02:39:44.540 --> 02:39:48.560]   but I do think that through maintaining the dialogue
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:51.680]   with the public, that we can continue to understand
[02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:52.720]   the world that we live in.
[02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:54.300]   And for that, I have to thank you
[02:39:54.300 --> 02:39:57.880]   for having created this platform.
[02:39:57.880 --> 02:39:59.320]   - Well, it's a labor of love
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:02.240]   and I'm honored to be able to do it.
[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:05.120]   And in no small part, because I get to sit down
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:08.280]   and have beautiful, intimate conversations
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:10.860]   about biology and life with you.
[02:40:10.860 --> 02:40:12.260]   So thank you so much.
[02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:13.200]   - Thank you.
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:15.080]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion

[02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:58.200]   I do read all the comments.
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:00.240]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:03.080]   I am HubermanLab on all social media platforms.
[02:41:03.080 --> 02:41:05.880]   So that's InstagramX, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:07.880]   LinkedIn threads, and Facebook.
[02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:09.200]   And on all of those platforms,
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:11.240]   I cover science and science-based tools,
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:12.720]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:13.960]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:15.920]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:17.360]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:20.520]   Again, that's HubermanLab on all social media channels.
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:22.760]   If you're not already following our newsletter,
[02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:24.280]   the Neural Network Newsletter
[02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:27.260]   is the Huberman Lab zero cost monthly newsletter
[02:41:27.260 --> 02:41:28.760]   that includes podcast summaries
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:32.040]   as well as protocols in the form of one to three page PDFs.
[02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:34.400]   The protocols cover topics such as how to improve
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:36.120]   and even optimize your sleep,
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:38.840]   how to regulate dopamine, deliberate cold exposure,
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:39.800]   deliberate heat exposure.
[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:41.940]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[02:41:41.940 --> 02:41:43.800]   that includes everything including schedules
[02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:46.040]   and sets and reps and cardiovascular training.
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:49.160]   We also have a neuroplasticity and learning super protocol.
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:51.400]   Again, all of which is available zero cost.
[02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:54.240]   You go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu tab,
[02:41:54.240 --> 02:41:56.560]   scroll down to newsletter and enter your email.
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:41:58.880]   And I should mention that we do not share your email
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:41:59.720]   with anybody.
[02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:02.120]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:03.640]   with Dr. Diego Borges.
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:06.080]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:08.080]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:10.660]   [upbeat music]
[02:42:10.660 --> 02:42:12.720]   you
