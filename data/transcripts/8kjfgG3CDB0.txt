[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Is the Christian's heart deceitfully wicked?
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.760]   You've heard that phrase, "deceitfully wicked" from the Old Testament, but is such an indictment
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.000]   actually applicable to the regenerated Christian heart?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.080]   The question is from a podcast listener named Micah.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.080]   "Pastor Jon, hello.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.680]   I was recently in a debate with a friend over Jeremiah 17.9.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.320]   The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately sick.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.040]   Who can understand it?
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.720]   I applied it to the ongoing sin blindness in the heart of the Christian.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.480]   My friend said I was taking a passage about unbelieving hearts and misapplying it to the
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.480]   Christian heart.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.920]   However, in returning to the bigger context of Jeremiah 17 verses 5-13, I find myself
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.960]   even more convinced verse 9 is equally applicable to believers, especially in light of verses
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.200]   7 and 8.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.200]   What do you think?
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.800]   Is Jeremiah 17.9 about believers, unbelievers, or both?
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.760]   Pastor Jon, how would you process this text and this context?
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.160]   Let me walk quickly through the flow of thought from verse 1 of Jeremiah 17 down through verse
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.200]   9, and I think everybody will be able to see how the verse is functioning if we do that,
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.800]   how verse 9 is functioning.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.320]   Jeremiah begins with an indictment of Judah and a warning of destruction.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.840]   It says, "The sin of Judah is engraved on the tablet of their heart while their children
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.920]   remember their altars and their asherim."
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.120]   Those are other gods, so idolatry is the issue here.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.800]   "Your wealth and all your treasures I will give as spoil and as a price of your high
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.520]   places for sin."
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.240]   So he's going to bring judgment upon them for the sin of their heart and the idolatry
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.280]   of their worship.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.240]   And then he says what's beneath that.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:04.160]   He says in verse 5, "Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes the flesh his strength,
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.200]   whose heart turns away from the Lord.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.600]   He is like a shrub in the desert and shall not see any good come."
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.920]   Now, that's the root problem of the idolatry and the sin.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.240]   The root problem is they are trusting in man, not in God.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.680]   And then he describes what alternatively ought to be the opposite of this and the benefits
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.280]   that would come if it were the case.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.800]   Blessed is the man—not cursed is the man who trusts in man—but blessed is the man
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.320]   who trusts in the Lord, whose trust is in the Lord.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.520]   He's like a tree planted by water that sends out its roots by the stream and does not fear
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.360]   when heat comes, for the leaves remain green.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.960]   And he's not anxious in the year of drought, for it does not cease to bear fruit.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.200]   Now, that leaves us with this question.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:07.480]   Well, if trusting in self results in such misery, "no good shall come," and trusting
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.080]   in God results in such fruitfulness, you can prosper.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:21.480]   Why in the world is a whole nation acting so suicidally in self-trust and sin and idolatry?
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.560]   And his answer is verse 9, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.200]   sick who can understand it."
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.300]   So the human heart is diseased with sin and in the sway of deceit, and that's why people
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.800]   act suicidally in preferring self-trust over God-trust.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.240]   So the overall point of the passage seems to be that the root of sin and idolatry is
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.640]   a failure to trust in God rather than self, and the root of that failure is a deceitful
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.960]   and depraved heart.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.960]   So I think Jeremiah—indeed, I think all the biblical writers—would say that's
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:12.400]   the root problem ever since the fall of man into sin and corruption.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:20.800]   All human beings, no exceptions, are born with this kind of fallen, diseased, deceived,
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.280]   self-exalting, God-opposing heart.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:32.960]   So the question is, when a person experiences the new birth, becomes a Christian, what happens
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.800]   to that diseased, deceived, self-exalting, God-opposing heart?
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.640]   And here are some verses that describe what happens.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.960]   So Ezekiel 36, the new covenant, described like this, "I will give you a new heart
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.840]   and a new spirit I will put within you, and I will remove the heart of stone from your
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.840]   flesh and give you a heart of flesh."
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:05.440]   Or Romans 6:17, "Thanks be to God that you who once were slaves of sin have become obedient
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.320]   from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed."
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:18.640]   Or Acts 15:9, "God made no distinction between Jew and Gentile, having cleansed their hearts
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.440]   by faith."
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:28.520]   Or John 7:38, "Whoever believes in me," Jesus says, "as the Scripture has said,
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.480]   out of his heart will flow rivers of living water."
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.480]   Oh, amazing!
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.080]   I want to be like that, right?
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.760]   I just want to have a kind of new heart that doesn't just enjoy water, it flows to other
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.760]   people.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.840]   So I'm going to read the next verse now, John 7:39, "Now this he said about the Spirit,
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.000]   whom those who believed in him were to receive."
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.360]   Or 1 Timothy 1:5, "The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart."
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.340]   Or 2 Corinthians 5:17, "If anyone is in Christ, he's a new creation."
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:15.680]   So my conclusion is that we can say that Jeremiah 17:9, "Deceitful above all things and desperately
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.080]   sick," the human heart, is true of the human heart, all of them.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:31.040]   But that where God is applying the blood-bought purchase of the new covenant, there is a new
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.960]   creation.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.960]   Sins are forgiven, Holy Spirit is poured in, new nature is brought into being.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:48.520]   That newness consists in the presence of the heart influencing Holy Spirit and in the new
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:56.880]   nature—you might call it the divine-like DNA—that is more and more being conformed
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.880]   to Christ.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.960]   So maybe a good verse to end on would be 2 Corinthians 3:18, "Beholding the glory of
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.800]   the Lord, we are being," I would say this old, horrible, self-exalting, God-opposing
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:18.760]   heart of mine, "is being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.760]   another."
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.320]   Really good and careful exegesis of these Old Testament texts and of key New Testament
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.320]   texts as well.
