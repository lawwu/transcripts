[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   (slow hip hop music)
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:10.920]   - Welcome to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.800]   I'm here with my guy.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.840]   Why don't you introduce yourself to the people?
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.840]   - My name's Josh Findley.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.640]   I'm a retired special agent from Homeland Security.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.560]   - Got you.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.840]   And the way this interview came about
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.200]   is actually kind of unique.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.160]   You ran into my brother on a plane
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.440]   and he, I guess you guys,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.480]   had the most interesting conversation
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.200]   and he texted me right when he landed.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.000]   He texted our family group chat and was like,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.600]   "I just met the most interesting guy.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.400]   "He had the craziest stories."
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.200]   Like, "Mike, you need to get him on your podcast."
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.760]   So how did you, so you and my brother just
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.920]   were sitting next to each other on the airplane?
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.760]   How'd that go?
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.400]   - Yeah, I was flying from Portland to Washington, D.C.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.760]   with a layover in Chicago
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.600]   and Jonte's team had just played in Portland
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.000]   the night before and they were flying to Chicago
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.600]   and he was sitting next to me
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.120]   and I just recently retired.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.080]   Like, when we were on the plane,
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.840]   I'd probably been like less than two weeks
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.000]   that I'd retired and it's kind of nice
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.480]   that I get to talk about stuff now
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.040]   'cause when you're working for the government,
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.520]   you know, there's a lot of stuff you can't talk about
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.520]   and so we started talking and I was telling him some stories
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.920]   and he was asking me questions
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.040]   and he was like, "Dude, my brother just had this girl
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.600]   who's a survivor of human trafficking on his podcast.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.040]   Like, I think you'd be like great for that."
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.880]   And so we talked about that and I was like,
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.000]   "Yeah, dude, I'd be happy to do it."
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.360]   And I had no clue that you were his brother, you know?
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.600]   So all I knew him was as Jonte at that point, so.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.960]   - Right, that's awesome.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.440]   Nah, I was super excited to talk to you.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.760]   For the people listening, like and for honestly me,
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.280]   what exactly is Homeland Security?
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.120]   I know I've heard the name, but what exactly is that job?
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.640]   - So there's, it would be similar
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.920]   to what you would think as an FBI agent, right?
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.920]   So after 2001, 9/11, the government reorganized
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.680]   and created the Department of Homeland Security in 2003.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.120]   So it has many different factions.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.400]   The Secret Service is under Homeland Security,
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.140]   the Border Patrol, Customs,
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.200]   all those are under Homeland Security.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.060]   Well, prior to 2003, there had been special agents
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.440]   for U.S. Customs, there had been special agents
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.680]   for immigration, there had been all these different
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.800]   special agents in Homeland Security.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.560]   So they brought them together to be one group,
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.320]   which eventually became Homeland Security Investigations.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.680]   And it brought together all those authorities
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.160]   to investigate crimes.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.760]   And so it has one of the broadest set of authorities
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.620]   to investigate crimes in the U.S.
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.400]   - How did you find yourself wanting
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.960]   to be in that line of work?
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.400]   - So ever since I was a kid,
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.480]   I thought I wanted to be an FBI agent.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.160]   I ended up joining the Army, became a military policeman.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.320]   And then I switched over to something that's called
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.600]   the Army Criminal Investigation Division,
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.480]   Army CID that does felony investigations,
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.680]   which then kind of led me
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.500]   into being a civilian federal agent.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.840]   I started off with the Treasury Department
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.760]   and then switched over to Homeland Security.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.360]   And then that's when I started working
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.440]   child exploitation cases.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.520]   And it's interesting, everybody's like,
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.880]   why would Homeland Security ever investigate
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.420]   child exploitation?
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.680]   And I'll just clarify this up front that,
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.680]   so what was referred to as child pornography
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.040]   has been kind of reclassified
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.400]   as child sexual abuse material,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   as it is better for the morale of survivors of exploitation.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:57.320]   And so if I say CSAM or any of those kinds of things
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.160]   that I'm talking about what you or many of your followers
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.640]   would think of as child pornography would be CSAM.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.640]   So historically, CSAM would come into the United States
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.320]   through the mail.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.360]   And so it would get intercepted by US Custom Service
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.280]   and it would be usually worked with Postal Service
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.600]   and Custom Service.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.980]   And so that's how Homeland Security
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.920]   kind of became a leader in CSAM investigations.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.920]   - Talk about your first story where you really realized
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.160]   like, man, this world is straight up evil.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.920]   Well, actually before we get into that,
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.840]   I wanna talk about when you decide to be a Homeland Security
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.120]   and be in a line of work,
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.560]   what is the things that you have to like sign
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.520]   or the things that you have to say,
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.580]   I'm not gonna speak on like,
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.020]   'cause you said this is one of your first interviews
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.860]   since you've retired.
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.680]   - It is.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.040]   - Is there things that you are not allowed to like,
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.000]   what's the--
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.560]   - So there are things that I had to sign
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.560]   a non-disclosure agreement about
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.240]   that are ongoing criminal investigations
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.200]   that I was involved in prior to my retirement.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.560]   I'm allowed to talk about things
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.100]   that have gone through the court system
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.160]   and stuff like that.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.760]   Then I was involved in some undercover things
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.140]   that if I were to talk about them,
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.440]   I think it would put myself and my family in jeopardy.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.040]   So I wouldn't talk about those.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.240]   - Right, wow.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.880]   Yeah, I wanna get into some of that later.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.240]   But yeah, talk about that first story
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.240]   where you were like, man, like this job is insane,
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.240]   but also the world that I live in like needs this.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.880]   The world that I live in is evil.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.360]   - And I can remember the first time
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.000]   that my eyes were completely open to it.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And this was a young girl, she was 10 and 11.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.960]   She was sexually abused by her father.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   It was recorded, put out on the internet.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.760]   Some detectives in Canada found these images
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.660]   and were able to use clues in the background of the images
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.320]   like a cup and a sweatshirt and those kinds of things.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.840]   And they found out that she was located
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.200]   in Northwest, Pacific Northwest.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.400]   And so we started looking for her there.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.680]   So we searched for her for two years.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.440]   And finally, we were able to figure out who she was
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.320]   based largely on the fact that she had reported sex abuse
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.480]   by her father to a local police department.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.880]   He had fled the country and he was featured on the media.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.360]   And that's kind of how we ended up
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.120]   linking those things together.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.120]   But through that process, when a victim is identified
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.820]   of child sexual abuse material,
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.280]   they are allowed to be notified
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.380]   by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.960]   every time someone is caught with their image.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.720]   Now, not every police department,
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.880]   not every federal agency,
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.080]   not everybody submits all their images
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.940]   to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.600]   but a lot of them do.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   And so after we were able to identify her,
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.080]   I started calculating how many times
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.740]   someone was caught with her image.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.100]   So the images were submitted.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.180]   Someone was caught possessing her images
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.600]   of her being raped as a 10-year-old.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:30.140]   It was six times a day, every four hours.
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.140]   So if you can imagine being a 16 or 17-year-old girl,
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.240]   having the worst moments of your life,
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.700]   being raped by your father,
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:44.500]   and knowing that men are being caught on the average
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.940]   of every four hours.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.780]   - Yeah.
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.500]   - To walk out into a grocery store,
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.460]   to walk into an elevator with three grown men
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.020]   and wonder which one of those has seen you.
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.180]   And like, that's the first time that,
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.260]   like when I did that calculation,
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.740]   it's the first time that really opened my eyes
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.860]   to like how screwed up this is.
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.060]   - Yeah, that fetish or whatever you wanna call it,
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.300]   for that to be something that grown men would wanna consume
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.620]   is really honestly strange.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.380]   Have you come to any conclusions on, you know,
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.020]   why that has even become a thing in our society?
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.860]   Like what feeds that desire for grown men
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.060]   not only to want to, you know, abuse young women,
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.620]   but to even consume it?
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.140]   Like have you guys figured that out at all?
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:36.860]   - So I think there's two general issues.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.580]   One is pornography and pornography addictions.
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.420]   - Yeah.
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.340]   - I know you've had a recent guest that talked about that,
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.880]   and you talked about it with her,
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.580]   that once someone has seen a certain type of pornography
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.940]   for so long, then they seek something new,
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.100]   something different, and those kind of things,
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.840]   or something taboo, something that's wrong.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.220]   So that's one way.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.420]   And then pedophilia is the other way,
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:05.040]   that men who are just absolutely attracted to children,
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.040]   and that with the onset of the internet,
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.340]   giving people the ability to be anonymous
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.260]   and hang out in chat rooms and have conversations
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.100]   that they would never have in public,
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.540]   like made it spread, you know, like wildfire.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.060]   - So was this the main, this was the main area of focus
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.320]   that you and your team were involved in?
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.160]   - Yeah.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.280]   So for about 20 years, I was focused
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.280]   on child sexual abuse investigations on a day-to-day basis.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.880]   - Which, you know, the message that I wanna get across
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.520]   to people, and the reason I've had multiple guests on here
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.520]   speaking on this specific issue is because it may not seem
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.320]   like it's the biggest issue in our world today,
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.120]   but almost a million children go missing a year,
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.580]   and no one knows, no one really speaks on it.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.020]   I don't know if it's not on the news
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.900]   because it's a sensitive subject.
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:03.960]   I don't know if it's not on the news
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.820]   because the same people that run these big media outlets
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.220]   are also the same people that are sometimes involved
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.220]   in these pedophilia rings.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.580]   I don't know, but the reason that I think it's important
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.600]   to speak on is because, man, this is happening
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.340]   every single day, like, you know, you can leave your kid
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.780]   in a grocery store for five seconds,
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.060]   they can get snatched up, you know?
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.020]   So I think it's just bringing awareness to it.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.820]   I know you have a lot of things to speak on,
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.140]   and we're gonna speak on a lot of things in this interview,
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.500]   but, you know, working undercover like that,
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.980]   were there ever any scary situations,
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.300]   or was it scary at all being undercover like that?
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.160]   To you, you've said there's been things
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.580]   that you didn't speak on because you were worried
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.620]   about the safety of your family.
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.660]   You know, speak on that whole thing a little bit.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.520]   - So I did a lot of undercover stuff,
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.540]   and I wanna circle back with you at some point
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.400]   about, like, kids getting abducted.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.860]   But, so throughout my career, I think my first time
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:05.480]   I did an undercover deal was in 1996, like a drug deal.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:11.940]   I have done undercover things into white supremacy groups,
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.540]   selling arms overseas,
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:21.100]   into different organizations.
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.580]   I've sold children, I've bought children, all those things.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:30.580]   So when it comes to, like, the fringe organizations,
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.220]   that's, like, where I wouldn't wanna talk about it
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.900]   because, you know, those people have long memories.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.100]   - Wow, okay, you talk about, so undercover,
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.100]   a lot of times you are obviously enacting
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.800]   like you're a part of something that you're not,
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.420]   and that's how you catch the people.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.580]   What is the process of buying or selling a child?
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.540]   - So, like, purchasing a child, like, you know,
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.900]   some of your previous guests have talked about,
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.380]   it's almost as easy as doing online stuff.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:05.380]   And so, to be able to go online and look through
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.860]   these different sites that advertise daily,
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.740]   you know, new to your area, this much an hour,
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.820]   these are the services, I mean, it's super easy to find.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.460]   And we would go on there, we would comb those websites,
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.980]   looking for phone numbers, looking for pictures,
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.980]   all those kind of things, where we could determine
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.180]   if there was a child, and we'd set up a date
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.580]   and then try to arrest the trafficker.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.340]   We did one of those operations and we were able,
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.620]   and it wasn't designed as, like, a prostitution thing
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.020]   to arrest the girl, it was to identify her
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.580]   and get her into victim services and those kind of things,
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.340]   and then to try to follow up and arrest the traffickers.
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:50.540]   And the, there's one operation I remember,
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.100]   it was one of the first ones I did,
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.340]   that we identified, I think it's eight people in one night.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:01.340]   And of those eight people, six of them
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:06.920]   were previously documented survivors of child sex abuse.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.200]   So you see how it feeds into each other.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.860]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.700]   - And then--
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.620]   - So you're saying the same people
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.260]   that were participating in this type of stuff,
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.660]   this same thing happened to them when they were younger?
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.180]   - No, no, no, sorry, the victims that we identified,
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.440]   eight of 'em, the people who find themselves
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.460]   being victimized by human traffickers
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.420]   often are the survivors of child sex abuse.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.360]   - Oh, got you.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.440]   Wow, that's crazy.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.620]   Do you, so some of the more mainstream kind of things
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.340]   that have hit the news in terms of, you know,
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.700]   that whole child trafficking has been the Wayfair thing
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.220]   and the Pizzagate thing, so-called conspiracy theories.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:54.140]   You as an undercover guy, how plausible are those
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.940]   like mega things where they're selling, you know,
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.620]   a piece of furniture but it's disguised as a child,
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.440]   things like that?
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.300]   - So, and I hope I'm not offensive to you at all,
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.360]   but it's complete bullshit and it wastes our time.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.280]   Because congressional people hear that,
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.280]   news media hears that, and then our agency
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.560]   gets all these requests dumped into like,
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.980]   why aren't you doing more about this?
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.320]   Why aren't you doing more about that?
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.280]   And we're answering these questions
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.440]   instead of actually going out and doing our job
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.540]   and finding kids that are being abused.
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.700]   Because unfortunately, like I was saying,
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:38.040]   most of the time, this isn't an abduction off the street.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:43.040]   Like that, if, do you know who Elizabeth Smart is?
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.840]   Have you heard of that story?
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.680]   - I haven't.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.480]   - So, it was in the late '90s, early 2000s,
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.980]   girl kidnapped from her house.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:58.920]   For years, one of the top stories in the media,
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.560]   a girl being kidnapped in Utah.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.320]   If there's a girl in Denver today who got snatched
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.560]   out of a grocery store,
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.140]   what would the local police's response be?
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.080]   - I don't know, you tell me.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.040]   - It would be helicopters, there'd be news media.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:16.880]   - You think?
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.280]   - Every cop around would be searching for this kid.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.600]   - So, what about the Amber Alerts on your phone?
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.880]   - So, most of the Amber Alerts on your phone
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.720]   are parental abductions.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.060]   So, there's a disagreement between parents
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.720]   and one parent who shouldn't have the kid takes the child.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.720]   - Gotcha.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.040]   - That's probably 90% of the Amber Alerts.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.160]   If you look at missing kids in the National Center
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.480]   for Missing and Exploited Children,
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.680]   probably 98% of them are runaways.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:50.840]   And the perception that kids are getting trafficked
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.180]   on Wayfair and stuff like that,
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.880]   it diminishes our capacity to respond
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.720]   to what I believe is the true problem,
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:04.720]   which is kids are getting abused by their father,
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.800]   their priest, their coach, their that,
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.480]   and it sets them into a downward spiral of drug addiction,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.480]   going into being trafficked.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.580]   Like, you know, Kat described a traumatic home life
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.480]   led her into seeking things in other places,
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:26.480]   and she got conned in by a trafficker,
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.280]   and that's 99% of the problem.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.680]   - Okay, so now let's circle back a little bit
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.260]   to just the statistics that come out
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.060]   about all the missing children year after year,
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.260]   not only in the United States, but worldwide.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.260]   So, you kind of are making a sound right now,
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.440]   like if that does happen, it's such an anomaly,
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.520]   and the police react so forcefully,
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.800]   and they get their, you know, the helicopters and things,
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.760]   but when I'm looking up these stats,
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.680]   it seems like it's happening a lot more
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.420]   than people are giving it credit for.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.680]   What are your thoughts on that?
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.680]   - So, I think that statistics drive money,
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:12.560]   and you can make a statistic say what you want it to say,
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.360]   and as far as kids not getting abducted off the streets,
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.160]   I'm specifically talking about the U.S.,
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.480]   and most civilized countries, that in a heartbeat,
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.800]   there would be an enormous law enforcement response.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.400]   Like, I don't know if you have any other friends
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   or cops, just ask 'em, what would happen
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.080]   if a kid got reported abducted, not missing?
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.800]   So, so many kids are reported missing
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.440]   because they didn't come home that night,
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.800]   and a lot of times, that's never cleared off the books
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.360]   if they come back in three days,
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.680]   'cause the parent doesn't report,
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.920]   oh, you know, my child ran away,
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.040]   and so then that's a statistic for a missing child,
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.640]   'cause it never got resolved.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.320]   And so, people look for statistics because,
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.640]   and unfortunately, there's a lot of money
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.160]   that flows to it because of people like you
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.000]   who are genuinely concerned and wanna do something about it,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.200]   and when people are genuinely concerned
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.120]   and they wanna contribute, then there's always people
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.560]   who come in and start these charities or non-profits,
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.680]   and they spin out new statistics to raise money,
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.200]   and so you just have to be really careful
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   on what organizations you try to donate to
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.160]   or support that are actually, I think,
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.040]   combating the real problems of child exploitation.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.080]   - Gotcha.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.440]   Sound of Freedom was a movie that came out recently,
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.920]   and it really caught a lot of people's attention.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.020]   There was a positive and negative response to that movie.
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:50.200]   How kind of accurate is that,
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.240]   and what were your thoughts on that movie as a whole?
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.480]   - So, my thoughts on the movie as a whole
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.640]   was it was a good movie.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:03.880]   Having worked the job, I was able to see that it was a movie.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.720]   - Yeah.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:10.000]   - If you watched a movie about your career last year
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.480]   and winning a championship, there'd be a lot of things
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.560]   that were left out, there'd be some things
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.920]   that maybe were changed a little bit,
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.640]   or those kind of things.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.940]   One of the things that I wish they had done better
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:26.560]   in the movie was that they portrayed Tim Ballard,
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.720]   who was an HSI agent, they portrayed him
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.600]   as doing every step of the investigations,
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.600]   and we are so dependent on being a part of a team
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.720]   that there's forensic interview specialists
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.560]   that interview children, there are analysts
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.520]   that run things for you, there are interview people,
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.000]   there are polygraph people, there are all these different
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.480]   parts of the team that work really, really well together,
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.060]   and for the purposes of that movie,
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.400]   the producers made it look like he did
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.240]   every one of those steps.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.000]   - Yeah, he was just the hero, and he was the only hero.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.120]   - Yeah, and he did great things,
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:11.120]   and his non-profit, Operation Underground Railroad,
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.160]   is still out there today, still trying to help kids
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.200]   all over the world.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.200]   I really endorse their mission and what they're trying
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.360]   to do, but at the end of the day, that was a movie,
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:32.220]   it was based on a true story, and I wish Tim
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.720]   all the luck in the world, and I know he's left
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.360]   Operation Underground Railroad now,
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.000]   and is doing some new things, but yeah,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.680]   I thought it was a great movie, it brought awareness,
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.480]   but it did tend to focus on that child abduction
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:53.480]   end of things, where the real problem is kids getting
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.920]   abused by people they know every day.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.560]   - Yeah, people they trust, teachers, coaches,
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.800]   like you said, even cousins, uncles.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.660]   - Yes, I've had all of those.
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.680]   - Dang.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.640]   So, you're under Homeland Security, I was recently
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.960]   watching an interview by Joe Rogan, actually,
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.080]   and he was talking about how Homeland Security
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.800]   is the team that invaded Diddy's house.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.960]   - Yes.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.920]   - Do you have any knowledge on why they went
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.900]   to his house and invaded it, and do you have
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.680]   any knowledge on that situation?
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.800]   - I have no direct knowledge of the investigation,
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:41.120]   so I have not taken a part in it, and if I had,
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.200]   I would not be able to say it, because it's
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.200]   an ongoing criminal investigation, but what I can say
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:53.400]   is that I believe it involved sex trafficking of minors,
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:59.680]   that the reason it seemed like an overwhelming response
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:05.260]   to a search warrant, deals with the people he has
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.320]   around protecting him and his property,
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.320]   their criminal histories, things like that.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.680]   So, if you have a security guard that has
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.760]   a previous homicide conviction, and he's armed,
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.400]   well, the cops are gonna treat the search warrant
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.320]   in a different way.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:28.200]   I can tell you that the level of probable cause
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.720]   that would go into getting the higher executives
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.960]   at Homeland Security had to sign off on that,
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.000]   judge had to sign off on that, the prosecutor's office
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.920]   had to sign off on that, and knowing that it would
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.280]   be someone that's gonna be high profile,
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.680]   it's gonna be able to hire 20 defense attorneys
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.160]   to try to pick everything apart, that it would have
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.960]   to be a pretty solid affidavit and allegation.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.720]   - For them to even go after him like that.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.840]   - Yeah.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:01.040]   - So, the idea of Hollywood and kind of these people
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.180]   with these pedophilia rings and things like that,
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.160]   and that that truly takes place, you know,
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.800]   you got the Jeffrey Epstein case, what are your thoughts
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.560]   on kind of the, 'cause that also is kind of a conspiracy
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.600]   that people think that kind of these higher up people
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.640]   are involved in these pedophilia rings,
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.400]   and then you know you have the Jeffrey Epstein case
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.180]   and kind of the defendants in his case,
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.320]   which were a lot of really well-known individuals
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.760]   and things like that, like, what are your thoughts on that?
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.080]   - Oh, there's corruption.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.280]   Like, I have no doubt about that.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.460]   That case is just wrought with problems.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:40.460]   Like, I had no involvement in it, none whatsoever, but--
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.440]   - But you've seen enough to know that that's going on.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.960]   - Yeah, it stinks.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.900]   Like, yeah, my question is this.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:54.640]   How do you charge Jelaine Maxwell in human trafficking
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.920]   when you can't prove who she trafficked a human to?
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.880]   You have to have an end user, right, to follow this, right?
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.000]   So if I was gonna sell drugs, you would have to prove
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.720]   that I sold them to a person, right?
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.660]   So if I'm gonna traffic a person, you'd have to prove
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.960]   that I sold it to a person.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.000]   What in any documents came out
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.760]   of who these kids were trafficked to?
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.600]   - So you're saying you think it's false?
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.360]   - No, I think they absolutely trafficked kids,
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.800]   and I think that there's--
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.860]   - Oh, you're saying the people on the receiving end,
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.400]   that's the people we need to be going after as well?
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.040]   - Yes, yes, the people who are having sex
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.320]   with the 14-year-olds or the 16-year-olds,
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.440]   paying for it, flying to an island.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.080]   Like, to cross out of our country
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.960]   with the intent to have sex with a child is a felony.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.120]   You're gonna do 10 years.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:44.960]   - Yeah.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.600]   - Is the idea that there's these very powerful people,
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.280]   whether it's politicians, whether it's Hollywood movie stars
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.640]   or different people of that caliber
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.840]   that are really into this type of stuff,
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.880]   do you think that to be the case?
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.260]   - I don't think so.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.800]   So I think that there is, like,
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:12.180]   true pedophilia is prepubescent, right?
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.760]   That's 11 or under.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.680]   And I think most of the people in the Epstein case,
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.320]   the P. Diddy case, you know, whatever,
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:23.560]   are probably gonna be in that 14 to 18 range,
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.360]   which is more called the hemophilia.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.380]   Somebody after the onset of puberty, but still a child.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.640]   So I think that's, in those circles,
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.800]   what the problem or what their focus is,
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.320]   what they're trying to get access to.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:45.120]   And I think the actual pedophilia,
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.200]   the raping of children, is a completely different thing.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.400]   And I don't think there are big rings
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.320]   where that's happening,
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.560]   where people are trafficking in two-year-olds
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.480]   or one-month-olds or those kind of things.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.600]   - Right.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.620]   Okay, so, 'cause I actually, you know, just being around,
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.240]   I kind of think the opposite.
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.860]   I kind of think there are a lot of people
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.240]   that you would never suspect,
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.660]   and they're powerful people that have a great background,
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.600]   and they will come off as super clean cut or whatever.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.480]   But on the side, they're involved in some crazy things.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.800]   Ryan Garcia, the boxer, recently came out
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   and talked about how the Bohemian Grove,
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.640]   I don't know if you know what that is.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.960]   - I don't.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.960]   - It's basically, yeah, he said he was brought into the woods
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.380]   and forced to watch, you know,
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.840]   some people might call him crazy, whatever.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.640]   The Bohemian Grove is a real place
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.220]   and kind of forced to watch, you know,
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.680]   people partaking, you know, this type of stuff with children
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.100]   and he said himself, he was raped as a young child.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:49.520]   But I think it's interesting talking to someone
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.280]   who works certain of these cases.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.600]   And I don't know if it's that these people are so high up
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.800]   and so protected that they get away with it,
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.200]   and, you know, the people that are kind of messy with it
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.540]   and the ones that are kind of like leave too many things
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.280]   behind are the ones that get caught.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.760]   But I kind of think it goes a lot higher and deeper
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.360]   than people suspect.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.360]   - I think that, you know,
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.960]   absolute power corrupts absolutely, right?
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.960]   And I think that powerful people
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.880]   corrupt other powerful people.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.720]   I think, you know, the Epstein thing
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.360]   was probably an intelligence operation
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:36.920]   that he collected evidence of this
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.520]   and it was, you know, given to different intelligence
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.480]   agencies to further their mission
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.880]   and to further push people in power
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.160]   to make decisions that were beneficial to them.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.520]   I absolutely believe that.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.360]   - Do you think Epstein, is the story that he killed himself?
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.520]   - Yeah, that's the story.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.640]   - Do you think that's what happened?
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.480]   - No.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.520]   - Do you think he knew too much and they killed him?
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.480]   - Yeah, there's too many anomalies there.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.600]   You know, one of your most high profile people
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.040]   would be arrested, right?
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.680]   And then you look at Dr. Michael Batten
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.120]   looking at the autopsy that it wasn't a typical hanging.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.960]   I've worked suicides, I've worked hangings.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.580]   I know what ligature marks are.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.760]   Like, I know all those things.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.040]   It's not gonna be on your, you know, high bone.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:27.040]   And it's, the cameras didn't work that night.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.560]   Both guards fell asleep.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.000]   Like, how many coincidences before you're like,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.440]   probably wasn't a coincidence?
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.680]   - Yeah.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.160]   - So how, what do you think you need to,
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.360]   like, how much do you need to know
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.120]   for them to come get you?
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.480]   I know there's been individuals in the past
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.160]   that just know too much and they're,
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.960]   it's a risk that they'll expose too much
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.520]   so they're just kind of shut up.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.840]   First of all, who does the shutting up?
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.720]   And why, what are the type of stuff that you need to like,
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.800]   know for them to even go to those lengths?
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.200]   - I have absolutely no clue.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.360]   I can tell you it's definitely not the men and women
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.720]   of Homeland Security Investigations that we're out there
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.560]   to do our jobs every day and to help people.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.480]   - Well, I'm thinking more it's like the people
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.520]   that are involved higher up.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.440]   Like, I don't know if it's like government,
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.680]   like, I don't know if it's like the same type of people
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.880]   that are involved that would, but I know, like you said,
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.720]   if you know too much, your life could be in danger.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.600]   Like you said, like even you were scared at times,
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.720]   you know, and you didn't want to reveal too much
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.920]   when you were working the job for fear of your life.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.320]   Like, who would you be afraid of?
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.880]   - So in undercover situations, it's criminal organizations.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.200]   And I'll start this off by saying,
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.000]   I never worked an undercover job
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.800]   on a motorcycle gang in my whole life.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.840]   I know several people who have,
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.640]   but if that gets out that the outlaw motorcycle gang
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.520]   figures out that you were an undercover,
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.560]   like they're going to hurt you and your family.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.400]   - Yeah.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.200]   Wow.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.040]   That's crazy.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.840]   Man, I got a lot of questions just about like what it is
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.160]   being an undercover kind of agent.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.400]   What's like one of your biggest kind of stories?
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.080]   I want to hear like a specific story
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:14.440]   of where like you had to pretend to be someone
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.640]   and you, like, tell me one of your big stories.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.480]   - I don't know.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.320]   Do you want to hear something related
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.360]   to like human trafficking or?
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.200]   - Anything, anything that's kind of like a crazy story
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.840]   as someone who is now retired that you can,
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.240]   yeah, talk about.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.840]   So I had one case where a guy met a couple online
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.720]   and he was in an online chat room and he found a couple
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.520]   or a guy who was looking to purchase access
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.080]   to have sex with a kid.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.640]   And so he started chatting with the guy
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.200]   and in our agency, you can chat online undercover,
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.040]   but in order to actually physically meet,
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.000]   you have to be certified.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.080]   You have to go through training, all those kinds of things.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.760]   So he passed it off to me.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.760]   So I started talking with this guy
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.760]   and he was into having sex
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.800]   with what he perceived to be my six-year-old daughter
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.520]   and he wanted to bring his wife along
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.400]   so they could both have sex with her and film it.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:15.120]   And so I, one of the things I would do
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.960]   if I'm having an undercover phone call would be,
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.760]   I would jump in a car with another agent.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.600]   I would have them turn their phone off
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.400]   and I would just say drive and I'll have my conversation.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.560]   And then if I needed to stop or think
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.760]   or something like, you know, I would just honk the horn.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.680]   I'd be like, oh man, this guy just cut me off in traffic.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.120]   You know, he just gave me that chance.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.240]   So I talked with this guy and he starts telling me
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.960]   about how he's been abusing his nine-year-old niece.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:45.960]   And so we end up making a date for him to come
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.600]   and molest my daughter.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.200]   And so he drives from Oregon into Washington State
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.640]   with his wife, with cameras and weed and toys.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.240]   And then once they arrived at the hotel
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.580]   then they were arrested and taken to jail.
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.840]   - That's crazy.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.120]   - And his nine-year-old niece was rescued
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.360]   and no longer subject to his abuse.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:17.920]   - I feel like, man, so how long does someone do time
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.000]   for something like that?
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.640]   Is he still behind bars?
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.160]   - Uh, man, he's going to be getting close.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.760]   I think he got 25 years.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.160]   - 25 years as well as the wife or what?
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.520]   - The wife got much less.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:34.240]   The court found that she had kind of a diminished capacity
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.800]   and that he was taking advantage of her.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.940]   So she got less time.
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.760]   - That is so crazy.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.080]   I was, I have interviewed a group
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.120]   called the Child Rescue Coalition.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.600]   - CRC, yeah, I know them well.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.440]   - I don't know if you're aware of them.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.680]   - Bill Wiltsy, the founder of the CRC is a former--
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.080]   - Is that who we interviewed?
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:51.960]   Is that who we interviewed?
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.880]   - Yeah, the CRC.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:53.880]   - But like, who was the lady?
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.600]   - I think her dad was the founder.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.080]   Carly was her dad.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.040]   - I know Bill.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.240]   I know Glenn Pounder.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.520]   - Bill, we talked on the phone with.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.400]   - Yeah, so he was a detective in Albany, Oregon.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.240]   - Okay.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.880]   - Before he went and founded the CRC.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.720]   Good group.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.280]   I've worked with many of 'em.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.500]   - Yeah.
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.220]   - I think I heard you talk about that
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.520]   on one of your other podcasts.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.600]   - Yeah, so they were just telling me the technology
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.440]   they used to kind of go into the dark web
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.360]   and these places on the internet
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.800]   that are kind of hard to reach
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.720]   and they'll find all the information they'll like.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.160]   Where the traffickers think things are untraceable,
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.480]   they can get that information.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.480]   And they kind of were talking about how
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.000]   they will give all this information to the police,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.580]   you know, of even like straight up like addresses,
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.920]   like go investigate this place.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.200]   But it's kind of like, it's not on the back burner
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.240]   but the police force, like there's not enough people
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.560]   working this specific issue.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.800]   So a lot of cases are dragged out
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.160]   and just kind of like got to when they can get to 'em.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.600]   Do you feel like enough is being done
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.800]   for this specific issue?
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.880]   - Absolutely not.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.480]   I definitely don't think so.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.480]   And I know exactly what you're talking about.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:09.480]   So we can take a photo down into what we call a hash ID,
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:13.900]   which is if you just think of a fingerprint
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:17.760]   that we can identify that photo from any other photo, right?
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.760]   And so that's with this alphanumeric code.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.840]   And so one of the things that CRC does
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:27.840]   is they'll track who's trading these images of CSAM, right?
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:32.060]   And so it's millions.
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.060]   So cops don't have enough time to work it.
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:39.060]   So if you're in, you know, Fort Smith, Arkansas,
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:45.280]   and you get a lead that one guy had three images of CSAM
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.200]   on his computer on November 9th,
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:53.760]   like is that the priority or is it the robbery
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.680]   at the gas station that's going on right now?
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   And with, and I don't mean this to be political at all,
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.880]   but with the defund the police movement
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.120]   and taking funds away from cops,
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.920]   they didn't take it away from patrol units.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.720]   They took it away from specialized units
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.880]   because that's what's expendable.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.200]   'Cause what the community expects
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.520]   is you to respond when I call, right?
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.160]   That's number one job.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.560]   Now this three CSAM image thing,
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.760]   that can be gotten to later, right?
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.520]   So when the police department shrunk,
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.280]   they took from all those specialized units,
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.840]   drug units, child exploitation units,
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.920]   all those things to fill in the patrol jobs.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:43.920]   So it really took it away from the specialized things
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.360]   and we don't have enough people to go out and do it.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.200]   - Man, that's crazy.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.840]   Yeah, when they were showing me the technology,
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.600]   like she was showing me in her computer
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.160]   how she could type in Denver
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.280]   and it shows all the dots or whatever
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.400]   where some stuff is going on
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.400]   that police haven't necessarily got to yet.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.680]   But she was typing in every city
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.480]   and I was like, man, this is crazy.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.880]   And she would just show me the scale
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.640]   of how big this problem is.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.120]   And so we triage those cases though, right?
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:11.960]   - Yeah.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:16.360]   - I'll tell you a good story
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.640]   that will make you feel better, right?
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.900]   We had an undercover agent in North Carolina.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:27.920]   He was on a chat room and engaged with a guy
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.480]   who said he was abusing his two-year-old daughter
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.120]   and sent the undercover pictures of it.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.040]   So you have to go through a lot of steps
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.760]   from you have a name of someone online
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.520]   to getting to doing a search warrant on their house, right?
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.680]   So you have to figure out
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.840]   what internet service provider
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.700]   is funding this person who's chatting, right?
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.600]   Get their name, do a background on them,
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.440]   all those kind of things.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.200]   Well, he found out that that guy was in Oregon.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.360]   So he sends it out to us.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.520]   So then we have to do a search warrant application,
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.760]   go to judges, go to all those kind of things.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   We did all that, arrested the guy, rescued his daughter.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.840]   She was wearing the same clothes
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.600]   that she was in when she was abused.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.880]   It took seven hours and 26 minutes
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.120]   to get from when he abused her and sent the picture
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.440]   for him to be in handcuffs
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.540]   and her to be in the back of a police car.
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:27.640]   So it does work, but we have to triage those, right?
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.520]   That is the allegation of a child actively being abused
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.860]   and everybody dropped everything, right?
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:39.520]   When it's, you know, this 19 year old kid
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.600]   has three images of 17 year olds on his computer
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.320]   that are actually CSAM because they're under 18.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.800]   Like that's not gonna get investigated.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.480]   It's not gonna be gone out on.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.520]   But that's again, where you can play with statistics.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.880]   On average, when you do catch these guys,
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   like I feel like that sentence should be a while.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.900]   - Is it normally like a long time?
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.380]   Like that's--
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:10.180]   - My biggest sentence was 270 years.
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.940]   - What was that for specifically?
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:18.580]   - This guy abused several young children,
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:24.940]   the youngest of which were two years old
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:29.500]   and he would torture them.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:34.500]   So just think of like the worst prisoner of war movie,
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:39.600]   torturing somebody, he would do that to two year old babies
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.040]   and then rape them.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:46.040]   - That's crazy, I can't believe people like that exist.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.900]   I always think that no human in their rational mind,
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.280]   I don't know if you're a religious person.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.120]   - I am.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.200]   - But I feel like that's almost like,
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.680]   that's demonic activity.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.960]   Like you can't do that as a rational human.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.960]   You gotta have like a demon in you or something, I think.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.560]   Like the stuff that you see would make me lose hope
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.280]   for some of these people.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   But I look at some of these people and I almost feel bad
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.680]   because it's like, how did you get to this point
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.480]   where that's like pleasurable to you?
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   - Yeah, I have no clue.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.360]   And I'll tell you what does give you hope
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:25.360]   is getting to see victims, survivors of this abuse
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.760]   come out of it and be better people.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.760]   And I've seen that and that's really inspiring.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:39.960]   And Kat is a beautiful example of somebody coming out
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.720]   of abuse and turning things around.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:46.680]   It doesn't happen enough and most of them,
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.800]   most of them it torments them their whole lives
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.840]   and they always struggle with those demons.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.160]   - Yeah, man.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.800]   So you watched the Kat episode and I asked her
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.380]   a lot of questions about this whole type of topic
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:06.220]   which she didn't really have answers for that you do.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.300]   Were there anything in that interview
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.200]   that you kinda wanna touch on in terms of like,
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.720]   yeah, that you saw or the questions that were asked?
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.040]   - So first of all, the first thing I thought
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.360]   was I wanted to give her a hug, right?
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.500]   And be like, hey, I'm sorry if law enforcement
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.520]   let you down, I'm sorry if you perceive
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.000]   that law enforcement let you down
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.400]   and that's never our intent.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:34.200]   But one of the things that I saw in that interview
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.840]   was like when she actually finally did go and tell the police
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.200]   and they asked her for a written statement
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.600]   that she didn't wanna provide a written statement.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   She wasn't at that point yet in her healing
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.800]   and I get that, right?
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.880]   For police officers that are investigating sex trafficking,
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:58.400]   oftentimes a victim survivor will be being re-victimized
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:03.580]   by somebody new before they can even file charges
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:06.580]   on the first person that victimized them.
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.660]   And then they don't cooperate, they don't show up for court,
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:10.860]   they don't do this.
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:14.220]   So it's frustrating for those cops
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.940]   'cause they wanna do the right thing,
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.620]   they wanna put somebody in jail,
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.580]   they wanna get the victim services.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.800]   But because of what those victims got going on in their lives
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.420]   and their minds and those things,
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.560]   they're just not able to put themselves in that situation,
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.400]   they find themselves back in drugs,
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.620]   back in being trafficked, all those things.
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.360]   So it's almost like this revolving door
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.520]   and it's really difficult for police officers
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.680]   and so they really have to lock somebody in
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.960]   on their statement and they're like,
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.400]   hey, this is what you're gonna testify to,
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.000]   you're gonna show up for court, right?
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.520]   Because how many times can you get burned
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.960]   and somebody get let off
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.880]   and then you're just throwing your hands up,
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.560]   like, what do you do?
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.400]   - Yeah.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.180]   Yeah, that's, I mean, so they,
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:02.040]   so it's better if they can pretty much cooperate and--
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:07.040]   - It's huge and I had, it was a really weird case.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.520]   I got asked to do an undercover deal
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.600]   with a girl who was being trafficked
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:17.080]   and I knew her.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.240]   I knew her mom and I knew her grandma
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.240]   and so-- - So you had to act
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.320]   like you were gonna buy this girl
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.680]   that you knew pretty much?
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.400]   - I had back out of it.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.780]   I couldn't do it. - Yeah, you had just had
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.620]   someone else do it?
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.840]   - Yeah, and so we ended up contacting her,
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.880]   interviewing her, she's doing really well right now
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:39.500]   but you could see the progression
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.280]   of just her going from one abuser
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.400]   to another abuser to another abuser
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.640]   and how many times her family tried to pull her out
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.200]   and took her away from it
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.640]   and she would just slide back to it.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.760]   - Yeah, yeah, when I was talking to Kat,
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.160]   what really caught my attention was the fact that,
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.760]   you know, the dude who was doing the selling,
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.160]   he got caught.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.760]   All those men with weird fetishes
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.640]   that buy these young women,
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.040]   they, a lot of times, get away with it
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.640]   and they could be just regular married guys
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.960]   with a family at home that are showing up
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.640]   to a hotel room to molest a kid or whatever.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.960]   Is there a lot of so-called normal people
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.480]   with normal lives that are involved in this type of stuff?
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:29.120]   - So, and one of the reasons that's so difficult
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:33.680]   is because once we know a 14-year-old's being trafficked,
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.680]   we have to do everything to stop it, right?
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.740]   It's not like you can see how many.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:41.880]   And so, the amount of different layers
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.400]   they put to protect themselves on
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.480]   who they trafficked the person to
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.880]   versus the protections that the people
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.440]   who the 14-year-old got trafficked to took,
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.440]   it makes it really hard to go back and do those.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.640]   - To retrace kind of the conversation
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.880]   they had with what people?
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.480]   - Yeah, and having been undercover
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.240]   as someone who's purchasing that,
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.320]   it's just so sad.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:13.260]   It was funny, I would just sit in a room and talk to 'em.
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:18.160]   It's like, I don't know, $300 for an hour or whatever.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:22.480]   And they wanted to do everything but have sex.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.740]   And if they thought they could get away
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.000]   with just talking to you for an hour,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.800]   they would just be like, "This is easy money."
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.440]   - So, you had to talk to the children?
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.320]   - Yeah, the girls, as an undercover?
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.600]   - Yeah.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:39.040]   So, a lot of times when you identify yourself as police,
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.400]   all those kind of things, then they clam up.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.360]   But if you're a John and you're just sitting there
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.400]   and you're asking 'em about their life,
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.060]   then they're willing to tell you anything
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.780]   to not have to perform a sex act.
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.360]   So, they'll sit there and talk to you.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.280]   So, it's a completely consensual conversation.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.000]   So, there's no rights violations or anything like that.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   So, I would try to get as much,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.360]   if we're gonna meet with girls that night,
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.720]   why don't I sit in the room with 'em
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.960]   and talk to 'em for 30 or 45 minutes
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.920]   and see how much information I can gain from them
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.040]   before the police come in and they arrest the pimp outside,
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:15.160]   all those kind of things.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.520]   Because she might be more willing
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.400]   to tell me a lot of information.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.560]   Or if not, I can get a lot of information
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:24.080]   that then when she's interviewed by a forensic specialist,
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.120]   then they're gonna be able to use
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.080]   a lot of that information and have a lot more knowledge
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:31.000]   when they try to engage with her and get her services.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.280]   - So, as an undercover agent,
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:37.160]   why can't you meet with these children?
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.680]   Is this talking to 'em in person or is it online?
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.500]   - In person.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.400]   - So, why can't you just walk into a room
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:47.120]   and see that this guy has these children and on the spot?
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:47.960]   - So, they do it all.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:48.960]   It's all outcalls.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.840]   So, we'll either set up a house or a hotel room
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.100]   and those kind of things.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:58.540]   The child will come to the front door.
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:01.960]   There's a car sitting three blocks away.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.000]   You got a surveillance team watching that.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:04.840]   Bring the kid in.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.640]   And then you have to make sure that they're there
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   to perform a sex act.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.720]   - You have to get certified proof.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.840]   - Right, so you're just making all those steps.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.720]   And so, my thought when doing that was,
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.920]   why not get as much information while I can?
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.120]   'Cause the car's sitting there outside.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.280]   Nothing's gonna happen.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:24.000]   - Dang, that is crazy to me.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.360]   - I had a 16-year-old girl with a pistol in her pocket.
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.560]   I was pretty sure she was gonna try to rob me.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.400]   - Really?
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.720]   - Yeah.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:35.200]   - Dude, that is a crazy job to work in.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.600]   Like, that is, do you have a lot of trauma now about that?
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.080]   Or it just, like, not?
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:45.040]   - I don't have a lot of trauma about it.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:50.440]   I know a lot of people who have done what I do
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.680]   have a lot of trauma.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.720]   I feel fortunate.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.160]   I feel like I have a great family.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.480]   I have great friends that understand what I go through.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.920]   - I don't need people like you, you know what I mean?
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.960]   Like, if there was no guys like you willing
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:07.640]   to put themselves in these situations, you know,
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:11.120]   we wouldn't rescue these kids in the first place.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.600]   What is your thought on corrupt cops?
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.680]   Is there, or corrupt, like, special agents?
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.200]   I've always wondered that because, like, you know,
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:21.880]   you hear the stories about the same guys
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.600]   that are supposed to be, you know, saving people
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.080]   are also involved in the same thing
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.600]   that they're trying to help or whatever.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.120]   Is that common or no?
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:28.960]   Have you seen that?
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.920]   - I've never seen that.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.720]   I mean, I've seen corruption.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:36.720]   Like, you know, I work for the Treasury Department
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.760]   and see people that would, you know,
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:42.040]   inappropriately access IRS data or whatever,
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.880]   you know, on their ex-spouse or something like that, right?
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.040]   That's corruption.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:50.000]   I haven't seen any widespread corruption.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.160]   I know that it occurs.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.320]   I'm not naive to that fact.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.280]   In the federal government, I think it happens way, way less
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.680]   than in certain, like, local police departments.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.840]   I know people in local police departments
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.440]   where there has been some widespread corruption.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.560]   And it's disheartening.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.200]   It becomes a culture.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.600]   With the federal government,
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:15.200]   the prerequisites in getting into it,
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.120]   the amount of training, the amount of moving around,
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:21.120]   the amount of just time it takes to get it done
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.040]   is, I think, you know, restrictive.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.040]   A lot of smaller police departments, you know,
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.440]   you're hiring somebody for $40,000 a year.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.160]   Federal agents making $120,000 a year, you know?
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:35.600]   So it's a lot easier to fall into corruption
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.800]   when you're in tough times yourself.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.200]   - Yeah.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.520]   I mean, yeah.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.480]   I totally agree with that.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:47.320]   What is the way that these people communicate
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.440]   to where it's untraceable?
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.280]   Is it through the dark?
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.920]   'Cause I think a lot of people have these,
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.040]   like, these thoughts about the dark web.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:56.200]   Like, what can you communicate on with someone
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.920]   to where you can never be traced?
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.240]   - So the dark web was,
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.880]   do you know why the dark web exists?
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.400]   - I mean, I'll say is I've gotten on the dark web
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.920]   before I had a brother who somehow downloaded the server.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.200]   I'm not a tech-savvy dude,
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.480]   but he somehow got me on the dark web.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.480]   And, like, the stuff that was accessible on there,
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.720]   the links you could click, it was crazy.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.120]   - Drugs, fake IDs, girls, all that kind of stuff.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:20.520]   - It was the craziest stuff.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.640]   Like, I remember clicking one link
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.480]   where it was just, like, I just wanted to see.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:29.120]   It was, like, I think it was, like,
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.000]   there was all these different links,
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.120]   and one of them was, like, videos about,
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.920]   I don't even know, suicide videos,
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.800]   just stuff that could never be on the regular internet.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.320]   Or it might be, like, torturing videos,
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:42.560]   or, you know, you can buy, like, guns or whatever it is.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.760]   But I couldn't believe the stuff that was on there.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.440]   But is that the avenue these guys use to communicate,
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:49.280]   or what?
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.320]   - I would say probably less than 50% of them
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.320]   use the dark web.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:58.560]   The dark web was created by the US government.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.760]   And what it was created for
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:06.760]   was to allow, like, dissidents in Iran or in China
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:11.040]   to be able to communicate without it being traced
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.480]   or intercepted by those foreign governments, right?
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.080]   So that's why it was created.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.320]   And you have your user,
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.440]   then you have these nodes that it goes through.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.040]   Like, it's complicated.
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:27.040]   But the biggest way,
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.720]   and probably something we haven't even touched on yet
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.640]   is these people are acting,
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.920]   is on online platforms where kids are at.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:41.160]   They're stalking kids on, you know, all these different,
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:45.280]   you know, I don't wanna throw any certain one out there,
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.200]   but there's all these different pages,
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.200]   you know, where kids congregate
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.360]   and they stay things and do things.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.560]   And that's where they're going
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.400]   and they're getting kids to produce material.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.400]   And one of the biggest trends,
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.800]   one of the biggest upsetting things
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.800]   is what's called sextortion,
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:04.760]   which is getting a kid to take a nude photo,
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.880]   pretending to be a kid their same age
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.320]   and be in love with them.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.880]   And then they send the photo
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.160]   and then they find out that that's an adult male.
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.720]   And now that they have one nude photo,
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.960]   they say, "I'm gonna send this to all your friends,
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.200]   "everybody in your school.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.000]   "Gonna give it to your parents, your church,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.880]   "if you don't take more nude photos for me."
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.800]   And so then they force these kids
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:29.680]   into abusing themselves for their pleasure
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.200]   on these online platforms.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.040]   - Dang, yeah.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.400]   I remember talking to the CRC and they were like,
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.560]   you know, these guys will even go on,
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.400]   say, like a Fortnite video game
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.160]   or whatever it is where kids just get on
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:43.040]   and, you know, get cool with them,
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.160]   make them feel comfortable,
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.400]   and then the stuff can start to happen.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.680]   - I'll tell a personal story.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:53.960]   I have, in my family, we call,
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.920]   my cousin's kids call me uncle
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.160]   and I call them my nieces and nephews.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:04.160]   Probably about 15 years ago,
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:07.000]   I got a call from my niece
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.920]   and said that there's a creepy guy at my house.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.920]   So it's like eight o'clock in the morning.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:15.480]   I grab my gun, jump in my truck,
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.160]   head to her house, nobody's there.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.240]   I go knock on the door, she opens the door,
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.360]   I talk to her and I say, "What's going on?"
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.440]   She's like, "I met this guy online."
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:28.520]   And I was like, "Why does he know your address?"
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.360]   She's like, "Well, I gave him my address."
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:33.560]   And I'm like, "Oh, first problem, right?"
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:36.160]   And, you know, this guy had started out
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:38.680]   pretending he was like 26
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.080]   and she was like 17 or whatever, 16.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:44.680]   And so they started this relationship.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.480]   Well, by the time it got to the end
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.600]   when he showed up at the house,
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:51.320]   it's a 53-year-old dude and she doesn't let him in.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.840]   And so I'm talking to her
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:56.520]   and she gets a message from the guy
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.040]   and he says, "It's okay, baby.
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.960]   "We can just have phone sex instead."
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.260]   And so I was like, "No, tell him to come back.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.520]   "Tell him you were in the shower and come back."
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:11.520]   So this six-foot-three, 350-pound, 53-year-old
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.280]   shows up at my aunt's door
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.040]   to have sex with my 16-year-old niece.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.120]   - And you got him right there.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.120]   - Oh yeah. - Yeah.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.040]   - Yeah, we had a talk.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.320]   I called the police and while we waited for them to come,
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:29.160]   we had a discussion about how sorry he was.
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.880]   And I told him, "Yeah, you're only sorry
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.520]   "'cause you got caught."
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.920]   - And he went to jail.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.520]   - Yeah.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:37.920]   - Dang, man.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:38.740]   - But--
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:43.000]   - Did she say how her and that dude met?
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.020]   - It was on just a internet chat program.
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:51.860]   But no matter who you are,
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:54.480]   this is where kids are getting abused
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.880]   is by people they trust, right?
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:01.880]   And pedophiles are creating trust online to abuse your kids.
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.580]   - Have you ever had to shoot one of these dudes?
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.640]   - No, I've never shot anybody in my life.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:07.480]   - Really? - Yeah.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:08.480]   - You're lucky.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:09.320]   - Yeah.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:11.600]   - Yeah, our team security was telling me a story
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.880]   'cause they also, the guy that does our team security
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.820]   also had to do some undercover stuff just here in Denver
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.840]   with normal, I don't think it was,
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.480]   it definitely wasn't child trafficking,
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.600]   but it was prostitution and he would undercover,
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.040]   like he was meeting up with these girls
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.680]   and then he would, same type of thing,
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:29.240]   and he was telling me some of those stories.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:34.240]   So yeah, I bet there's some crazy situations
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:36.020]   you ran into.
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.260]   - There are, there are.
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:38.280]   - How old are you now?
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.140]   - I'm 50 years old.
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:42.300]   - So you were just, it's time to give this up.
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.380]   - Well, I became eligible to retire at 50.
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.220]   - Yeah.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:49.180]   - And so on the very first day I was eligible to retire,
[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:50.260]   I retired.
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:51.100]   - Yeah.
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:56.100]   - And I took three new jobs within 10 days of retiring.
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:01.260]   So I work for the Indomitian Sioux Family Foundation
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:05.520]   and a company called, or a non-profit
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.120]   called Operation Light Shine.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.160]   And Operation Light Shine works with the Thiebaud Foundation
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:13.100]   to build out centers and pay for cops
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:16.280]   to get the best technology and to pay for the salaries
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.320]   of cops to work together in collaboration centers
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:23.520]   to combat the problem of child exploitation.
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.680]   And then I took a job with a private company
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:29.400]   who does facial recognition technology.
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:34.700]   And through my career, I can absolutely say
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:39.060]   that I'm aware of over a thousand children
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:41.820]   that were identified by using this technology.
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.940]   And so I was really excited to get to go work
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.060]   for that company too.
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:47.700]   - Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.960]   Is there any, 'cause my big thing that I like to talk about
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.900]   is just the things that go on in this world,
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:57.100]   the conspiracy theories, I guess is what you would say.
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:01.940]   Is there any that you are kind of like knowledgeable
[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:03.020]   or passionate about or some things
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:06.140]   that you didn't really get to speak on during your career
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:11.140]   that you can tell us about or things like that?
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:13.680]   - No.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.660]   - Things that'll blow our mind?
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:15.860]   - No.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:18.340]   - The world is what it seems.
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:22.020]   - No, it isn't, but there's none that I can comment on.
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.920]   - But there's things you know.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.060]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:27.100]   - You just can't talk about 'em for what,
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:30.100]   more safety on your family's side
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.460]   or is it things that you just--
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.140]   - No, it's ongoing.
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:35.700]   - Oh, ongoing things, got you.
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:36.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.460]   - Well, when it's not, well, I need to hear,
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.140]   I need to hear stuff off camera.
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:42.300]   (laughing)
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:45.220]   But man, no, I really appreciate you getting on here.
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:50.860]   And you know, this, as someone who this issue,
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.060]   for some reason, it's always kind of like,
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:55.540]   it's something that's kind of touched my heart.
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:57.620]   I appreciate you doing your job
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:02.180]   and helping so many people and kind of sharing your story.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:06.020]   And yeah, man, I wish you all the best in retirement.
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:08.580]   I wish you, you know, a lot of peace
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:10.060]   and a lot of joy in the rest of your life.
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:11.180]   - I appreciate it.
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:12.580]   - Yeah, man, is there anything else
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:13.700]   you wanna get off your chest?
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:15.140]   Or I feel like we covered a lot.
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:15.980]   I feel like that--
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:16.940]   - Yeah, if you ever wanna have me back,
[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.660]   if you come up with like 10 more guests
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:20.060]   and you got questions that you wanna kind of
[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:22.980]   wrap back around to, or maybe some of these investigations
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:24.780]   get over with and we can talk again.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:26.220]   - 100% man, thank you.
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:27.440]   Curious Mike out.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:30.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:31.660]   Thank you, bro.
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.540]   - Wait, I have some questions.
[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:36.980]   One, the guy that was abusing the two-year-olds,
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:39.420]   how did he get two-year-olds?
[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:41.660]   - Mom was an alcoholic and a prostitute.
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:45.700]   She would go out and drink and run tricks.
[00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:48.820]   And he offered to stay back there with her babies,
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:49.660]   two-year-olds.
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:50.900]   - He would just like babysit people's kids?
[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:51.900]   'Cause it wasn't just those two.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:52.980]   - It was just her kids.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:56.740]   He kind of had like a friendship relationship with her.
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:00.580]   He actually did kidnap one girl off of a playground
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.920]   outside of his apartment building and abuse her.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.660]   But then he let her go and she went home
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:06.540]   and didn't tell anybody.
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:09.620]   So we only knew that he did it because of the pictures.
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:11.940]   He abused the nine-year-old older sister
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:13.540]   of the two-year-olds.
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:15.580]   He would feed her, like cough syrup
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:18.420]   and get her to fall asleep and then abuse her.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.940]   I forget who else he abused, but--
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:22.300]   - Oh, it's so disgusting.
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:25.540]   - Did you hear about the Drake and Josh documentary?
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:27.820]   The Nickelodeon, have you seen that?
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:29.180]   - I haven't seen it yet.
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:33.260]   - The Nickelodeon documentary,
[00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:37.260]   just about how many of those dudes in that,
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:40.700]   man, they were, like the guy at Drake and Josh,
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:42.420]   that dude was getting molested.
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:44.620]   But like a lot of them in Nickelodeon
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:48.320]   were like doing that to these kids on these child shows.
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:49.160]   It was like a big thing.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.100]   A lot of these kids are messed up now.
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:52.500]   - 'Cause of that.
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:54.300]   - That's why I think it's so much bigger,
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.960]   like that's why I think there's higher things
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:01.100]   that are running some weird organized ring type stuff.
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:02.580]   - I wonder if it's organized or if they just like--
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:03.420]   - Hunter Biden.
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:06.140]   - That's the son of Joe Biden, right?
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:08.860]   You wanna know a crazy story about him?
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:09.700]   - Yeah.
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:11.900]   - This dude, 'cause I know a girl, right,
[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:16.540]   who was telling me about these sex parties in LA.
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:20.040]   This dude got kicked out of this sex party in LA.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.860]   She was telling me kinda what goes on,
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:23.480]   how they're doing like all this.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.540]   You walk from room to room
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.840]   and you see different celebrities, different politicians.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.240]   You know, a lot of them have the masks on.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.320]   But you know, the girl I was talking to is pretty famous
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:31.400]   and she was telling me what goes on
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.320]   at these sex parties in LA.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.560]   That same dude, Hunter Biden, was at the same one
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:38.320]   and he got kicked out of the sex party,
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.800]   of the sex club because he,
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.000]   I guess one of the rules is you have to ask before you touch
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.640]   and he was like disrespecting the women in there or whatever
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.780]   but yeah, that's a bad guy right there.
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:50.900]   - Yeah, he is and he's got some younger people
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:54.660]   than were 18 on the list there too.
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:55.500]   - Really?
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.320]   - Yeah.
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:57.160]   - Okay, I have more questions.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.700]   'Cause you were in the Pacific Northwest, right?
[00:59:58.700 --> 00:59:59.540]   - Yes, ma'am.
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.220]   - This guy that I knew,
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:04.480]   'cause at the time I had a boyfriend up there
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:07.340]   and his father worked at this church.
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:08.180]   He worked at the church,
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:09.620]   he worked with like college-age students.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:12.020]   Like he was like a seemingly great guy,
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.500]   had a YouTube talking about God,
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.440]   talking about Jesus, da, da, da, da.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.600]   A year or two now ago, he got arrested for,
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.360]   have you heard of Isaac Chirac?
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.880]   He got arrested for trafficking girls into Seattle.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.640]   He was like someone like we kicked it with.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.560]   Like we knew him, he was like normal, nice,
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.760]   like worshiped Jesus.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.600]   - Really?
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.420]   - Yes.
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:32.840]   - I arrested a guy who, he molested his daughter.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.440]   She was like 10 or 11.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.560]   He got sent to prison for 10 years.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.160]   He got out, joined a church,
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.360]   got on the missionary group for the church,
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.540]   went to Africa, found a lady there to marry
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.460]   who had two daughters and started abusing
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:50.220]   both of her daughters in Kenya.
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:53.700]   - So people just really use the church as a cover,
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.540]   which leads me to my last question.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:57.540]   Why do you think it's so prevalent with like
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:58.720]   Catholic priests?
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.540]   - I have no clue.
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.740]   Like I think that's just child rape.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:05.580]   You know what I mean?
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.340]   I don't think they're filming it, they're doing anything.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:10.620]   I haven't had any investigations into the Catholic church,
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.140]   but I totally agree with you.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.260]   And I think it's just like,
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:16.860]   once that kind of infection starts
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.780]   and you keep those people on
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:22.220]   and they bring on other people, it's like, just.
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.660]   - So do you think it's like--
[01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:25.700]   - You're right though, bro.
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.020]   It is the porn because like,
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:31.580]   you get desensitized to normal stuff
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.060]   and you need weird stuff.
[01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:36.300]   And then I bet you that's not how this stuff happens.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.460]   - The Catholic priest, do you think that there's a part
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.900]   that's like, because of the job,
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.140]   where they're not allowed to get married,
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:42.300]   they're not allowed to have sex with women?
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:43.340]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:45.980]   They, they, they, it's gotta be.
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.420]   They can't-- - It's gotta be.
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.100]   - Yeah, it's gotta be.
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.820]   They're supposed to be celibate for life,
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.740]   but those people who are supposed to be celibate,
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:54.340]   they end up doing wild stuff.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:57.500]   - (laughs) That's always the most wild ones
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.460]   are the ones that are the quietest, shy ones.
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:02.540]   - It's just wild to me that this is such a,
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.460]   like you would think this is like a freak issue
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:07.660]   that only like a very few number of people deal with,
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:09.620]   but like you said, it's just so widespread
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:11.660]   and I think that's the scariest part.
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:13.660]   - Oh. - Like an hour.
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:14.500]   - That was good, man.
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.340]   I thought it was good.
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.180]   What'd you think, Steve?
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.020]   - Yeah, I thought it was good.
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.660]   I thought you, I thought it was like super natural
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:19.500]   to just blow everything up.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.580]   - Yeah, I did, too.
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:21.780]   Good, good, good.
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.580]   - You're good at talking.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:26.900]   - Oh, try being an undercover for a few years.
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.460]   - Oh yeah, you gotta-- - You gotta bullshit yourself
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:29.820]   out of a few situations.
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:31.060]   - Give your P's and Q's.
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.860]   - I have something that's called essential tremor syndrome
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:36.180]   and it's been getting worse as I get older, so I'll shake.
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.020]   - Yeah.
[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:40.220]   - And so, when I'm under a lot of stress,
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:43.380]   it gets really bad, like it'll be really noticeable.
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:48.380]   And so, I had to buy a bunch of fentanyl last year,
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:51.140]   so I had to go meet this dude to buy, you know,
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:54.260]   couple thousand pills of fentanyl and I'm like, fuck,
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:56.220]   I'm just gonna be shaking like a motherfucker.
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.260]   So I'm texting with him beforehand.
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.980]   I'm like, hey dude, I can't do this shit
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.700]   'cause I have early onset Parkinson's
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.100]   and it'll fuck with my medication, stuff like that,
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.380]   so I just threw it in this subtle text.
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:10.820]   And so then, when I went, I noticed myself shaking.
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:13.900]   I'm like, fucking Parkinson's, man, this shit's gonna be bad.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:16.900]   And I'm just like, it's not, it's not Parkinson's at all,
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.300]   but it's like, you know what I mean?
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:19.940]   Let me use my weakness as my strength.
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:21.980]   Like, who's thinking that somebody's gonna be a cop
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:22.900]   and has Parkinson's?
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.060]   - Right. - Right.
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:27.460]   - Nah, dude, I bet it is crazy
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.420]   having to work undercover and just put on that persona,
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.340]   like you're one of these freaks, you know?
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.660]   - Yeah, they have to watch every minute of it.
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:36.700]   You're literally an actor.
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:37.940]   You're like a professional actor.
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.820]   - I would just take confessions that I got
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:41.380]   'cause I love to do interviews.
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:43.340]   I would interview, and so I had a bunch of people
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:45.140]   that I interviewed and they would confess everything to me
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:47.100]   and tell me all about abusing.
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:49.980]   Like the guy from Africa, he confessed everything.
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:50.820]   - Yeah.
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:53.420]   - And so I would just make their story my own
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:55.420]   and I would just, that would be my story.
