[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   (slow hip hop music)
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:10.860]   - Welcome to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.780]   I'm here with my guy.
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.780]   Why don't you introduce yourself to the people?
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.820]   - My name's Josh Findley.
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.580]   I'm a retired special agent from Homeland Security.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.500]   - Got you.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.780]   And the way this interview came about
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.140]   is actually kind of unique.
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.100]   You ran into my brother on a plane
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.420]   and I guess you guys had the most interesting conversation
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.180]   and he texted me right when he landed.
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.980]   He texted our family group chat and was like,
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.560]   "I just met the most interesting guy.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.280]   "He had the craziest stories.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.180]   "Like Mike, you need to get him on your podcast."
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.700]   So how did you, so you and my brother just
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.900]   were sitting next to each other on the airplane?
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.740]   How'd that go?
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.340]   - Yeah, I was flying from Portland to Washington, D.C.
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.980]   with a layover in Chicago and Jontae's team
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.340]   had just played in Portland the night before
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.980]   and they were flying to Chicago
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.540]   and he was sitting next to me
[00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.940]   and I just recently retired.
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.860]   When we were on the plane, I'd probably been
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.980]   less than two weeks that I'd retired
[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.460]   and it's kind of nice that I get to talk about stuff now
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.520]   'cause when you're working for the government,
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.460]   there's a lot of stuff you can't talk about
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.460]   and so we started talking and I was telling him some stories
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.920]   and he was asking me questions and he was like,
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.000]   "Dude, my brother just had this girl
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.120]   "who's a survivor of human trafficking on his podcast.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.060]   "I think you'd be great for that."
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.880]   And so we talked about that and I was like,
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.020]   "Yeah, dude, I'd be happy to do it."
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.780]   And I had no clue that you were his brother.
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.620]   So all I knew him was as Jontae at that point.
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.980]   - Right, that's awesome.
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.460]   Nah, I was super excited to talk to you.
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.780]   For the people listening and for honestly me,
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.300]   what exactly is Homeland Security?
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.140]   I know I've heard the name but what exactly is that job?
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.660]   - So there's, it would be similar
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.940]   to what you would think as an FBI agent, right?
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.940]   So after 2001, 9/11, the government reorganized
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.700]   and created the Department of Homeland Security in 2003.
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.140]   So it has many different factions.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.400]   The Secret Service is under Homeland Security,
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.140]   the Border Patrol, Customs,
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.220]   all those are under Homeland Security.
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.060]   Well, prior to 2003, there had been special agents
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.700]   for US Customs, there'd been special agents for immigration,
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.380]   there'd been all these different special agents
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.820]   in Homeland Security.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.540]   So they brought them together to be one group
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.340]   which eventually became Homeland Security Investigations.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.680]   And it brought together all those authorities
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.180]   to investigate crimes.
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.740]   And so it has one of the broadest set of authorities
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.620]   to investigate crimes in the US.
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.420]   - How did you find yourself wanting
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.960]   to be in that line of work?
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.380]   - So ever since I was a kid,
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.500]   I thought I wanted to be an FBI agent.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.180]   I ended up joining the Army, became a military policeman.
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.340]   And then I switched over to something that's called
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.820]   the Army Criminal Investigation Division,
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.480]   Army CID that does felony investigations,
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.700]   which then kind of led me
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.500]   into being a civilian federal agent.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.260]   I started off with the Treasury Department
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.780]   and then switched over to Homeland Security.
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.340]   And then that's when I started working
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.460]   with child exploitation cases.
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.540]   And it's interesting, everybody's like,
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.940]   why would Homeland Security ever investigate
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.420]   child exploitation?
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.700]   And I'll just clarify this up front that,
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.700]   so what was referred to as child pornography
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.060]   has been kind of reclassified
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.420]   as child sexual abuse material,
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.420]   as it is better for the morale of survivors of exploitation.
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:57.360]   And so if I say CSAM or any of those kinds of things
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.900]   that I'm talking about what you or many of your followers
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.700]   would think of as child pornography, would be CSAM.
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.700]   So historically, CSAM would come into the United States
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.380]   through the mail.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.380]   And so it would get intercepted by U.S. Customs Service.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.300]   And it would be usually worked with Postal Service
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.640]   and Customs Service.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.020]   And so that's how Homeland Security
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.940]   kind of became a leader in CSAM investigations.
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.700]   - Talk about your first story
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.860]   where you really realized like,
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.180]   man, this world is straight up evil.
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.980]   Well, actually, before we get into that,
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.860]   I wanna talk about when you decide to be a Homeland Security
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.140]   and be in the line of work,
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.580]   what is the things that you have to like sign
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.540]   or the things that you have to say,
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.580]   I'm not gonna speak on like,
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.020]   'cause you said this is one of your first interviews
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.860]   since you've retired.
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.680]   - It is.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.020]   - Is there things that you are not allowed to like,
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.980]   what's the--
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.540]   - So there are things that I had to sign
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.540]   a non-disclosure agreement about
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.260]   that are ongoing criminal investigations
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.220]   that I was involved in prior to my retirement.
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.540]   I'm allowed to talk about things
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.100]   that have gone through the court system
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.140]   and stuff like that.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.740]   Then I was involved in some undercover things
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.140]   that if I were to talk about them,
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.460]   I think it would put myself and my family in jeopardy,
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.060]   so I wouldn't talk about those.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.220]   - Right, wow.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.860]   Yeah, I wanna get into some of that later.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.260]   But yeah, talk about that first story
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.220]   where you were like, man, like this job is insane,
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.260]   but also the world that I live in like needs this.
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.900]   The world that I live in is evil.
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.340]   - And I can remember the first time
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.980]   that my eyes were completely open to it.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.740]   And this was a young girl.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.500]   She was 10 and 11.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.980]   She was sexually abused by her father.
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.980]   It was recorded, put out on the internet.
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.780]   Some detectives in Canada found these images
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.660]   and were able to use clues in the background of the images
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.320]   like a cup and a sweatshirt and those kind of things,
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.820]   and they found out that she was located
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.180]   in Northwest, Pacific Northwest.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.380]   And so we started looking for her there.
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.660]   So we searched for her for two years,
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.460]   and finally we were able to figure out who she was
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.300]   based largely on the fact that she had reported sex abuse
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.460]   by her father to a local police department.
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.860]   He had fled the country and he was featured on the media,
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.380]   and that's kinda how we ended up
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.100]   linking those things together.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.460]   But through that process,
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:45.580]   when a victim is identified of child sexual abuse material,
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.300]   they are allowed to be notified
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.380]   by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.960]   every time someone is caught with their image.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.720]   Now, not every police department,
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.880]   not every federal agency,
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.080]   not everybody submits all their images
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.940]   to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.600]   but a lot of 'em do.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   And so after we were able to identify her,
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.080]   I started calculating how many times
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.740]   someone was caught with her image.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.100]   So the images were submitted.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.180]   Someone was caught possessing her images
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.600]   of her being raped as a 10-year-old.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:30.140]   It was six times a day, every four hours.
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.140]   So if you can imagine being a 16 or 17-year-old girl,
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.240]   having the worst moments of your life,
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.700]   being raped by your father,
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:44.500]   and knowing that men are being caught, on the average,
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.940]   of every four hours.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.780]   - Yeah.
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.500]   - To walk out into a grocery store,
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.460]   to walk into an elevator with three grown men,
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.020]   and wonder which one of those has seen you.
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.460]   And that's the first time that,
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.260]   when I did that calculation,
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.740]   it's the first time it really opened my eyes
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.900]   to how screwed up this is.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.180]   - Yeah, that fetish, or whatever you want to call it,
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.300]   for that to be something that grown men would want to consume
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.620]   is really, honestly, strange.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.140]   Have you come to any conclusions
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.180]   on why that has even become a thing in our society?
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.860]   What feeds that desire for grown men,
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.060]   not only to want to abuse young women,
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.620]   but to even consume it?
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.140]   Like, have you guys figured that out at all?
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:36.860]   - So, I think there's two general issues.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.620]   One is pornography and pornography addictions.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.460]   - Yeah.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.340]   - I know you've had a recent guest that talked about that,
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.860]   and you talked about it with her,
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.580]   that once someone has seen a certain type of pornography
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.940]   for so long, then they seek something new,
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.100]   something different, and those kind of things,
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.860]   or something taboo, something that's wrong.
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.180]   So, that's one way.
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.380]   And then pedophilia is the other way,
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.020]   that men who are just absolutely attracted to children,
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:10.020]   and that with the onset of the internet,
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.300]   giving people the ability to be anonymous
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.220]   and hang out in chat rooms and have conversations
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.060]   that they would never have in public,
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.540]   like, made it spread like wildfire.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.060]   - So, was this the main area of focus
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.340]   that you and your team were involved in?
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.180]   - Yeah.
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.300]   So, for about 20 years, I was focused
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.020]   on child sexual abuse investigations
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.620]   on a day-to-day basis.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.900]   - Which, you know, the message that I wanna get across
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.060]   to people, and the reason I've had multiple guests
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.900]   on here speaking on this specific issue
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.500]   is because it may not seem like it's the biggest issue
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.380]   in our world today, but almost a million children
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.780]   go missing a year, and no one knows.
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.580]   No one really speaks on it.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.020]   I don't know if it's not on the news
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.900]   because it's a sensitive subject.
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:03.980]   I don't know if it's not on the news
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.820]   because the same people that run these big media outlets
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.220]   are also the same people that are sometimes involved
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.220]   in these pedophilia rings.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.580]   I don't know, but the reason that I think it's important
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.620]   to speak on is because, man, this is happening
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.460]   every single day.
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.340]   Like, you know, you can leave your kid
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.740]   in a grocery store for five seconds.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.060]   They can get snatched up, you know?
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.020]   So I think it's just bringing awareness to it.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.820]   I know you have a lot of things to speak on,
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.140]   and we're gonna speak on a lot of things in this interview,
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.500]   but, you know, working undercover like that,
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.980]   were there ever any scary situations,
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.740]   or was it scary at all being undercover like that?
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.100]   You said there's been things that you didn't speak on
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.640]   because you were worried about the safety of your family.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.660]   You know, speak on that whole thing a little bit.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.500]   - So I did a lot of undercover stuff,
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.540]   and I wanna circle back with you at some point
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.380]   about, like, kids getting abducted.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.140]   But, so throughout my career,
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.060]   I think my first time I did an undercover deal
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.480]   was in 1996, like a drug deal.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:11.940]   I have done undercover things into white supremacy groups,
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.540]   selling arms overseas.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:21.040]   Into different organizations, I've sold children,
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.600]   I've bought children, all those things.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.580]   So when it comes to, like, the fringe organizations,
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.220]   that's, like, where I wouldn't wanna talk about it
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.900]   because, you know, those people have long memories.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.100]   - Wow, okay, you talk about, so undercover,
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.100]   a lot of times you are obviously enacting
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.780]   like you're a part of something that you're not,
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.380]   and that's how you catch the people.
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.500]   What is the process of buying or selling a child?
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.660]   - So, like, purchasing a child,
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.820]   like some of your previous guests have talked about,
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.300]   it's almost as easy as doing online stuff.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.180]   And so to be able to go online
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.500]   and look through these different sites
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.540]   that advertise daily, you know,
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.660]   new to your area, this much an hour,
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.740]   these are the services, I mean, it's super easy to find.
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.380]   And we would go on there, we would comb those websites,
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.900]   looking for phone numbers, looking for pictures,
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.900]   all those kind of things where we could determine
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.100]   if there was a child, and we'd set up a date
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.500]   and then try to arrest the trafficker.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.260]   We did one of those operations and we were able,
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.460]   and it wasn't designed as, like,
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.660]   a prostitution thing to arrest the girl.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.940]   It was to identify her and get her into victim services
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.500]   and those kind of things.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.220]   And then to try to follow up and arrest the traffickers.
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:50.420]   And there's one operation I remember,
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.980]   it was one of the first ones I did,
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:56.220]   that we identified, I think it's eight people in one night.
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.740]   And of those eight people,
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:04.660]   six of them were previously documented
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.820]   survivors of child sex abuse.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:11.100]   So you see how it feeds into each other.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.820]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:13.660]   - And then--
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.580]   - So you're saying the same people
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.220]   that were participating in this type of stuff,
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.620]   this same thing happened to them when they were younger?
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.140]   - No, no, no, sorry, the victims that we identified,
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.380]   eight of 'em, the people who find themselves
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.420]   being victimized by human traffickers
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.380]   often are the survivors of child sex abuse.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.300]   - Oh, got you.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.380]   Wow, that's crazy.
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:39.580]   So some of the more mainstream kind of things
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.020]   that have hit the news in terms of that whole
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.540]   child trafficking has been the Wayfair thing
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.220]   and the Pizzagate thing, so-called conspiracy theories.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.580]   You as an undercover guy,
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:55.180]   how plausible are those mega things
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.860]   where they're selling a piece of furniture
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.420]   but it's disguised as a child, things like that?
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.300]   - So, and I hope I'm not offensive to you at all,
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.380]   but it's complete bullshit and it wastes our time.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.300]   Because Congressional people hear that,
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:16.300]   news media hears that, and then our agency
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.580]   gets all these requests dumped into like,
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.980]   why aren't you doing more about this,
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.300]   why aren't you doing more about that?
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.260]   And we're answering these questions
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.420]   instead of actually going out and doing our job
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.540]   and finding kids that are being abused.
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.740]   Because unfortunately, like I was saying,
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:38.300]   most of the time, this isn't an abduction off the street.
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:43.300]   That, if, do you know who Elizabeth Smart is?
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.820]   Have you heard of that story?
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.660]   - I haven't.
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:51.460]   - So, it was in the late '90s, early 2000s,
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.960]   girl kidnapped from her house.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.900]   For years, one of the top stories in the media,
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.520]   a girl being kidnapped in Utah.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.980]   - Yeah.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.460]   - If there's a girl in Denver today
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.540]   who got snatched out of a grocery store,
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.140]   what would the local police's response be?
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.420]   - I don't know, you tell me.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.060]   - It would be helicopters, there'd be news media.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:16.900]   - You think?
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.740]   - Every cop in, around, like,
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.260]   would be searching for this kid.
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.580]   - So, what about the Amber Alerts on your phone?
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.900]   - So, most of the Amber Alerts on your phone
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.700]   are parental abductions.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.060]   So, there's a disagreement between parents
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.740]   and one parent who shouldn't have the kid takes the child.
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.740]   - Gotcha.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.040]   - That's probably 90% of the Amber Alerts.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.580]   If you look at missing kids in, like,
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.500]   the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.680]   probably 98% of them are runaways.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:50.860]   And the perception that kids are getting,
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.180]   you know, trafficked on Wayfair and stuff like that,
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.860]   it diminishes our capacity to respond
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.720]   to what I believe is the true problem,
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:04.720]   which is kids are getting abused by their father,
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.800]   their priest, their coach, their, that,
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.480]   and it sets them into a downward spiral of drug addiction,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.480]   going into being trafficked.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.580]   Like, you know, Kat described a traumatic home life
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.480]   led her into seeking things in other places,
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:26.480]   and she got conned in by a trafficker,
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.280]   and that's 99% of the problem.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.480]   - Okay, so now let's, yeah,
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.380]   let's circle back a little bit to the,
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.260]   just the statistics that come out
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.920]   about all the missing children, you know,
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.200]   year after year, not only in the United States,
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.100]   but worldwide.
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.260]   So, you kind of are making a sound right now,
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.440]   like, if that does happen, it's such an anomaly,
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.520]   and, like, the police react, like, so, like, forcefully,
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.880]   and, you know, they get their, you know,
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.800]   the helicopters and things,
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.760]   but, like, when I'm looking up these stats,
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.680]   it seems like it's happening a lot more
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.420]   than people are giving it credit for.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.680]   What are your thoughts on that?
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.680]   - So, I think that statistics drive money,
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:12.560]   and you can make a statistic say what you want it to say,
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.360]   and as far as kids not getting abducted off the streets,
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.160]   I'm specifically talking about the US,
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.060]   and most civilized countries,
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.460]   that, in a heartbeat,
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.820]   there would be an enormous law enforcement response.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.780]   Like, I don't know if you have any other friends or cops,
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.420]   just ask 'em, what would happen
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.100]   if a kid got reported abducted, not missing?
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.860]   So, so many kids are reported missing
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.480]   because they didn't come home that night,
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.820]   and a lot of times, that's never cleared off the books
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.420]   if they come back in three days,
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.740]   'cause the parent doesn't report,
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.940]   oh, you know, my child ran away,
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.060]   and so then, that's a statistic for a missing child,
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.680]   'cause it never got resolved.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.380]   And so, people look for statistics because,
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:03.380]   and unfortunately, there's a lot of money that flows to it
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.260]   because of people like you who are genuinely concerned
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.020]   and wanna do something about it,
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.220]   and when people are genuinely concerned
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.760]   and they wanna contribute,
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.780]   then there's always people who come in
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.620]   and start these charities or non-profits,
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:21.700]   and they spin out new statistics to raise money.
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.220]   And so, you just have to be really careful
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:29.220]   on what organizations you try to donate to or support
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.140]   that are actually, I think,
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:36.040]   combating the real problems of child exploitation.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.080]   - Gotcha.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.460]   Sound of Freedom was a movie that came out recently,
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.940]   and it really caught a lot of people's attention.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.000]   There was a positive and negative response to that movie.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   How kind of accurate is that,
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.940]   and what were your kind of thoughts
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.260]   on that movie as a whole?
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.740]   - So, my thoughts on the movie as a whole was
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.740]   it was a good movie.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.720]   Having worked the job,
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.060]   I was able to see that it was a movie.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:04.900]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.740]   - Yeah.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.980]   - If you watched a movie about your career last year
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.640]   and winning a championship,
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.360]   there'd be a lot of things that were left out,
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.940]   there'd be some things that maybe were changed a little bit
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.680]   or those kind of things.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.960]   One of the things that I wish they had done better
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.600]   in the movie was that they portrayed Tim Ballard,
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.360]   who was an HSI agent.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.060]   They portrayed him as doing every step
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.640]   of the investigations.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.640]   And we are so dependent on being a part of a team
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.760]   that there's forensic interview specialists
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.120]   that interview children.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.140]   There are analysts that run things for you.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.540]   There are interview people.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.100]   There are polygraph people.
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.940]   All these different parts of the team
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.460]   that work really, really well together.
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.060]   And for the purposes of that movie,
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.900]   the producers made it look like
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.540]   he did every one of those steps.
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.020]   - He was the hero and he was the only hero.
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.140]   - Yeah, and he did great things.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:11.140]   And his non-profit, Operation Underground Railroad,
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.540]   is still out there today,
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.200]   still trying to help kids all over the world.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.720]   I really endorse their mission
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.280]   and what they're trying to do.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:27.220]   But at the end of the day, that was a movie.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.120]   It was based on a true story.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:34.360]   And I wish Tim all the luck in the world.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.340]   And I know he's left Operation Underground Railroad now
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.040]   and is doing some new things.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.360]   But yeah, I thought it was a great movie.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.680]   It brought awareness.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.160]   But it did tend to focus on
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.520]   that child abduction end of things,
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.520]   where the real problem is kids getting abused
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.920]   by people they know every day.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.200]   - Yeah, people they trust.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.040]   - Yes.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.520]   - Teachers, coaches, like you said.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.800]   Even cousins, uncles.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.660]   - Yes, I've had all of those.
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.680]   - Dang.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.040]   So you're under Homeland Security.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.480]   I was recently watching an interview
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.960]   by Joe Rogan, actually.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.080]   And he was talking about how Homeland Security
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.800]   is the team that invaded Diddy's house.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.960]   - Yes.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.920]   - Do you have any knowledge on why they went
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.120]   to his house and invaded it?
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.680]   And do you have any knowledge on that situation?
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.800]   - I have no direct knowledge of the investigation.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.480]   So I have not taken a part in it.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.760]   And if I had, I would not be able to say it
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.760]   because it's an ongoing criminal investigation.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.600]   - Yeah, right.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.240]   - But what I can say is that I believe
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.660]   it involved sex trafficking of minors.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:59.640]   That the reason it seemed like an overwhelming response
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.300]   to a search warrant, like why you bring,
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:08.280]   deals with the people he has around protecting him
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   and his property, their criminal histories,
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.320]   things like that.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.680]   So if you have a security guard that has
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.760]   a previous homicide conviction and he's armed,
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.400]   well, the cops are gonna treat the search warrant
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.360]   in a different way.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:28.200]   I can tell you that the level of probable cause
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.740]   that would go into getting the higher executives
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.000]   at Homeland Security had to sign off on that.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.480]   Judge had to sign off on that.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.560]   The prosecutor's office had to sign off on that.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.440]   And knowing that it would be someone
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.320]   that's gonna be high profile,
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.720]   it's gonna be able to hire 20 defense attorneys
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.480]   to try to pick everything apart,
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.320]   that it would have to be a pretty solid affidavit
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.160]   and allegation.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.760]   - For them to even go after him like that.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.080]   - So the idea of Hollywood and kind of these people
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.200]   with these pedophilia rings and things like that,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.200]   and that that truly takes place.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.880]   You got the Jeffrey Epstein case.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.680]   What are your thoughts on kind of the,
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.600]   'cause that also is kind of a conspiracy
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.640]   that people think that kind of these higher up people
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.680]   are involved in these pedophilia rings.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.440]   And then you got the Jeffrey Epstein case
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.240]   and kind of the defendants in his case,
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.360]   which were a lot of really well-known individuals
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.200]   and things like that.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.800]   Like, what are your thoughts on that?
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.120]   - Oh, there's corruption.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.280]   Like, I have no doubt about that.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.440]   That case is just wrought with problems.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.440]   Like, I had no involvement in it, none whatsoever, but--
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.400]   - But you've seen enough to know that that's--
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.960]   - Yeah, it stinks.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.800]   Like, yeah.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.920]   My question is this.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:54.640]   How do you charge Jelaine Maxwell in human trafficking
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.920]   when you can't prove who she trafficked a human to?
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.240]   You have to have an end user, right?
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.880]   To follow this, right?
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.360]   So if I was gonna sell drugs,
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.720]   you would have to prove that I sold them to a person, right?
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.040]   So if I'm gonna traffic a person,
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.800]   you'd have to prove that I sold it to a person.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.400]   - Yeah.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.000]   - What in any documents came out
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.760]   of who these kids were trafficked to?
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.600]   - So you're saying you think it's false?
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.360]   - No, I think they absolutely trafficked kids.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.800]   And I think that there's--
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.840]   - Oh, you're saying the people on the receiving end,
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.400]   that's the people we need to be going after as well?
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.040]   - Yes, yes, the people who are having sex
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.440]   with the 14-year-olds or the 16-year-olds,
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.440]   paying for it, flying to an island.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.080]   Like, to cross out of our country
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.960]   with the intent to have sex with a child is a felony.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.120]   You're gonna do 10 years.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:44.960]   - Yeah.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.840]   - Like, do you, is the idea
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.600]   that there's these very powerful people,
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.720]   whether it's politicians,
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.280]   whether it's Hollywood movie stars,
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.640]   or, you know, different people of that caliber
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.840]   that are really into this type of stuff,
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.840]   do you think that to be the case?
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.280]   - I don't think so.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:09.120]   So I think that there is, like, true pedophilia,
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.200]   so, is prepubescent, right?
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.760]   That's 11 or under.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.680]   And I think most of the people in the Epstein case,
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.320]   the P. Diddy case, you know, whatever,
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:23.560]   are probably gonna be in that 14 to 18 range,
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.400]   which is more called hemophilia,
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.640]   that somebody after the onset of puberty,
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.400]   but still a child.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.680]   So I think that's, in those circles,
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.840]   what the problem, or what their focus is,
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.360]   what they're trying to get access to.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:44.840]   And I think in the actual pedophilia,
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.240]   the raping of children is a completely different thing,
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.440]   and I don't think there are big rings
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.360]   where that's happening,
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.600]   where people are trafficking in two-year-olds,
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.520]   or one-month-olds, or those kind of things.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.640]   - Right.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.320]   Okay, so, 'cause I actually, you know,
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.280]   just being around, I kind of think the opposite.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.880]   I kind of think there are a lot of people
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.280]   that you would never suspect,
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.680]   and they're powerful people that have a great background,
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.640]   and they will come off as super clean-cut or whatever,
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.520]   but on the side, they're involved in some crazy things.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.800]   Ryan Garcia, the boxer, recently came out
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   and talked about how the bohemian growth,
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.680]   I don't know if you know what that is.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.960]   - I don't.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.200]   - It's basically, yeah,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   he said he was brought into the woods and forced to watch.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.840]   You know, some people might call him crazy, whatever.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.640]   The bohemian growth is a real place,
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.200]   and kind of forced to watch, you know,
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.680]   people partaking, you know, this type of stuff with children,
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.080]   and he said himself, he was raped as a young child.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.400]   But I think it's interesting,
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.280]   talking to someone who works certain of these cases.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.840]   And I don't know if it's that these people
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.640]   are so high up and so protected
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.800]   that they get away with it,
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.200]   and you know, the people that are kind of messy with it,
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.680]   and the ones that are kind of like,
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.280]   leave too many things behind are the ones that get caught.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.240]   But I kind of think it goes a lot higher
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.360]   and deeper than people suspect.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.360]   - I think that, you know,
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.480]   absolute power corrupts absolutely, right?
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.320]   - Yeah.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.960]   - And I think that powerful people
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.880]   corrupt other powerful people.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.720]   I think, you know, the Epstein thing
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.360]   was probably an intelligence operation
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:36.920]   that he collected evidence of this,
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.320]   and it was, you know,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.120]   given to different intelligence agencies
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.440]   to further their mission,
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.840]   and to further push people in power
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.120]   to make decisions that were beneficial to 'em.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.520]   I absolutely believe that.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.700]   - Do you think Epstein,
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.360]   is the story that he killed himself?
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.560]   - Yeah, that's the story.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.640]   - Do you think that's what happened?
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.480]   - No.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.520]   - Do you think he knew too much, and they killed him?
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.480]   - Yeah, there's too many anomalies there.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.640]   You know, one of your most high-profile people
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.040]   would be arrested, right?
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.680]   Then you look at Dr. Michael Baden,
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.120]   looking at the autopsy,
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.120]   that it wasn't a typical hanging.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.960]   I've worked suicides, I've worked hangings.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.580]   I know what ligature marks are.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.760]   Like, I know all those things.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.320]   It's not gonna be on your, you know,
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.740]   high-owed bone, and it's,
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.200]   the cameras didn't work that night.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.560]   Both guards fell asleep.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.000]   Like, how many coincidences before you're like,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.440]   probably wasn't a coincidence?
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.680]   - Yeah.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.160]   So, what do you think you need to,
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.380]   like, how much do you need to know
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.120]   for them to come get you?
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.480]   I know there's been individuals in the past
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.760]   that just know too much,
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.940]   and it's a risk that they'll expose too much,
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.520]   so they'll just kinda shut up.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.840]   First of all, who does the shutting up,
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.720]   and what are the type of stuff that you need to, like,
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.800]   know for them to even go to those lengths?
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.200]   - I have absolutely no clue.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.760]   I can tell you it's definitely not
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.280]   the men and women of Homeland Security Investigations
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.280]   that we're out there to do our jobs every day,
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.120]   and to help people.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.200]   - Well, I'm thinking more it's, like,
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.560]   the people that are involved higher up.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.520]   Like, I don't know if it's, like, government,
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.800]   like, I don't know if it's, like,
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.880]   the same type of people that are involved
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.920]   that would, but I know, like you said,
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.760]   if you know too much, your life could be in danger.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.640]   Like, you said, like, even you were scared at times,
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.760]   you know, and you didn't wanna reveal too much
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.960]   when you were working the job for fear of your life.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.360]   Like, who would you be afraid of?
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.880]   - So, in undercover situations, it's criminal organizations,
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.240]   and I'll start this off by saying
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.040]   I never worked an undercover job
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.840]   on a motorcycle gang in my whole life.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.880]   I know several people who have,
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.680]   but if that gets out, that the Outlaw Motorcycle Gang
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.560]   figures out that you were an undercover,
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.600]   like, they're gonna hurt you and your family.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.440]   - Yeah. - So.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.240]   - Wow.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.080]   That's crazy.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.640]   Man, I got a lot of questions just about, like,
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.200]   what it is being an undercover kinda agent.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.440]   What's, like, one of your biggest kinda stories?
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.120]   I wanna hear, like, a specific story
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:14.480]   of where, like, you had to pretend to be someone,
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.680]   and you, like, tell me one of your big stories.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.880]   - I don't know, do you wanna hear something
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.400]   related to, like, human trafficking, or?
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.240]   - Anything, anything that's kinda like a crazy story
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.880]   as someone who is now retired that you can,
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.280]   yeah, talk about.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.880]   - So, I have one case where a guy met a couple online,
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.760]   and he was in an online chat room, and he found a couple,
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.560]   or a guy who was looking to purchase access
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.120]   to have sex with a kid.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.680]   And so, he started chatting with the guy,
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.240]   and in our agency, you can chat online undercover,
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.080]   but in order to actually physically meet,
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.000]   you have to be certified, you have to go through training,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.120]   all those kinda things.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.800]   So, he passed it off to me.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.800]   So, I started talking with this guy,
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.800]   and he was into having sex with what he perceived
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.840]   to be my six-year-old daughter,
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.560]   and he wanted to bring his wife along
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.440]   so they could both have sex with her and film it.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:15.160]   And so, I, one of the things that I would do
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.360]   if I'm having an undercover phone call
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.800]   would be I would jump in a car with another agent,
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.640]   I would have them turn their phone off,
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.640]   and I would just say, "Drive,"
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.440]   and I'll have my conversation.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.600]   And then, if I needed to stop or think,
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.800]   or something like, you know, I would just honk the horn.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.600]   I'd be like, "Oh, man, this guy just cut me off in traffic.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.160]   "You know, he just gave me that chance."
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.280]   So, I talked with this guy, and he starts telling me
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.960]   about how he's been abusing his nine-year-old niece.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:45.960]   And so, we end up making a date for him to come
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.600]   and molest my daughter.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.200]   And so, he drives from Oregon into Washington State
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.680]   with his wife, with cameras, and weed, and toys.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.240]   And then, once they arrived at the hotel,
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.600]   then they were arrested and taken to jail.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.840]   - That's crazy.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.120]   - And his nine-year-old niece was rescued
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.360]   and no longer subject to his abuse.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.680]   - I feel like, man, it...
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.040]   So, how long does someone do time for something like that?
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.600]   Is he still behind bars?
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.160]   - Man, he's gonna be getting close.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.760]   I think he got 25 years.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.160]   - 25 years as well as the wife, or what?
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.520]   - The wife got much less.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:34.240]   The court found that she had kind of a diminished capacity
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.800]   and that he was taking advantage of her.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.960]   So, she got less time.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.680]   - That is so crazy.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.080]   I have interviewed a group
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.120]   called the Child Rescue Coalition.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.600]   - CRC, yeah, I know him well.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.440]   - I don't know if you're aware of that.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.840]   - Bill Wiltsy, the founder of the CRC, is a former...
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.080]   - Is that who we interviewed?
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:51.920]   Is that who we interviewed?
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.840]   - Yeah, CRC.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.840]   - But, like, who was the lady?
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.560]   - I think her dad was the founder.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.080]   Carly was her dad.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.040]   - I know Bill.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.280]   I know Glenn Pounder.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.480]   - Bill, we talked on the phone once.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.840]   - Yeah, so he was a detective in Albany, Oregon
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.880]   before he went and founded the CRC.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.720]   Good group.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.280]   I've worked with many of them.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.200]   I think I heard you talk about that
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.520]   on one of your other podcasts.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.560]   - Yeah, so they were just telling me the technology
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.440]   they use to kind of go into the dark web
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.360]   and these places on the internet
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.800]   that are kind of hard to reach
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.640]   and they'll find all the information.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:28.160]   Where the traffickers think things are untraceable,
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.480]   they can get that information.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.480]   And they kind of were talking about how
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.560]   they will give all this information to the police
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.600]   of even like straight up like addresses,
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.920]   like go investigate this place.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.200]   But it's kind of like, it's not on the back burner,
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.480]   but the police force,
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.560]   like there's not enough people working this specific issue.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.800]   So a lot of cases are dragged out
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.160]   and just kind of like got to when they can get to 'em.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:55.960]   - Yeah.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.600]   - Do you feel like enough is being done
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.800]   for this specific issue?
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.440]   - Absolutely not, I definitely don't think so.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.440]   And I know exactly what you're talking about.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   So we can take a photo down into what we call a hash ID,
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.880]   which is if you just think of a fingerprint
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.760]   that we can identify that photo from any other photo, right?
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.760]   And so that's with this alphanumeric code.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.840]   And so one of the things that CRC does
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:27.840]   is they'll track who's trading these images of CSAM, right?
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.060]   And so it's millions.
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.040]   So cops don't have enough time to work it.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:39.040]   So if you're in Fort Smith, Arkansas,
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:45.280]   and you get a lead that one guy had three images of CSAM
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.200]   on his computer on November 9th,
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.520]   like is that the priority
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.520]   or is it the robbery at the gas station
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.680]   that's going on right now?
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.480]   - Yeah.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:02.080]   - With, and I don't mean this to be political at all,
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.880]   but with the defund the police movement
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.640]   and taking funds away from cops,
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.920]   they didn't take it away from patrol units.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.120]   They took it away from specialized units.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:12.960]   - Right.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.880]   - Because that's what's expendable.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.200]   'Cause what the community expects
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.520]   is you to respond when I call, right?
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.160]   That's number one job.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.560]   Now this three CSAM image thing,
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.320]   that can be gotten to later, right?
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.160]   - Yeah.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.520]   - So when the police department shrunk,
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.280]   they took from all those specialized units,
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.840]   drug units, child exploitation units,
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.920]   all those things to fill in the patrol jobs.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:43.920]   So it really took it away from the specialized things
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.360]   and we don't have enough people to go out and do it.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.200]   - Man, that's crazy.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.840]   Yeah, when they were showing me the technology,
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.600]   like she was showing me in her computer
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.160]   how she could type in Denver
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.280]   and it shows all the dots or whatever
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.440]   where some stuff is going on
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.400]   that police haven't necessarily got to yet.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.680]   But she was typing in every city
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.480]   and I was like, man, this is crazy.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.880]   And she would just show me the scale
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.640]   of how big this problem is.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.080]   - And so we triaged those cases though, right?
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:11.920]   - Yeah.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.520]   - I'll tell you a good story
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.600]   that will make you feel better, right?
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.880]   We had an undercover agent in North Carolina.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.920]   He was on a chat room and engaged with a guy
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.480]   who said he was abusing his two-year-old daughter
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.120]   and sent the undercover pictures of it.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.040]   So you have to go through a lot of steps
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.760]   from you have a name of someone online
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.520]   to getting to doing a search warrant on their house, right?
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.840]   So you have to figure out what internet service provider
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.700]   is funding this person who's chatting, right?
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.600]   Get their name, do background on them,
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.440]   all those kind of things.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.200]   Well, we found out that that guy was in Oregon.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.360]   So he sends it out to us.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.520]   So then we have to do a search warrant application,
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.760]   go to judges, go to all those kind of things.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:10.280]   We did all that, arrested the guy, rescued his daughter.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.840]   She was wearing the same clothes
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.600]   that she was in when she was abused.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.880]   It took seven hours and 26 minutes
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.120]   to get from when he abused her and sent the picture
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.440]   for him to be in handcuffs
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.520]   and her to be in the back of a police car.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.600]   So it does work, but we have to triage those, right?
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.480]   That is the allegation of a child actively being abused
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.820]   and everybody dropped everything, right?
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:39.480]   When it's, you know, this 19 year old kid
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.560]   has three images of 17 year olds on his computer
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.280]   that are actually CSAM because they're under 18.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.760]   Like that's not gonna get investigated.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.440]   It's not gonna be gone out on.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.480]   But that's again, where you can play with statistics.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.840]   - On average, when you do catch these guys,
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:00.840]   like I feel like that sentence should be a while.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.880]   Is it normally like a long time?
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.360]   Like that's a-
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.160]   - My biggest sentence was 270 years.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.940]   - What was that for specifically?
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:18.560]   - This guy abused several young children
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.000]   the youngest of which were two years old
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.960]   and he would torture them.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:30.960]   So just think of like the worst prisoner of war movie
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:36.160]   torturing somebody, he would do that to two-year-old babies
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.640]   and then rape them.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.160]   - That's crazy.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.240]   I can't believe people like that exist.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.760]   I always think that no human being
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.800]   in their rational mind,
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.280]   I don't know if you're a religious person.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.120]   - I am.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.080]   - But I feel like that's almost like,
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.680]   that's a demonic activity.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.880]   Like you can't do that as a rational human.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.760]   You gotta have like a demon in you or something, I think.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.360]   Like the stuff that you see would make me lose hope
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.920]   for some of these people.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.760]   But I look at some of these people
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.200]   and I almost feel bad because it's like you,
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.040]   how did you get to this point
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.800]   where that's like pleasurable to you?
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:12.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.120]   I have no clue and I'll tell you what does give you hope
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:21.120]   is getting to see victims, survivors of this abuse
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:25.440]   come out of it and be better people.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:30.440]   And I've seen that and that's really inspiring.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:35.440]   Cat is a beautiful example of somebody coming out of abuse
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.840]   and turning things around.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.400]   It doesn't happen enough and most of them,
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.560]   most of them, it torments them their whole lives
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.560]   and they always struggle with those demons.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:53.000]   - Yeah, man, so you watched the Cat episode
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.240]   and I asked her a lot of questions
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.040]   about this whole type of topic
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.720]   which she didn't really have answers for, that you do.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.480]   Were there any things that you had to do
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:09.320]   that you do, were there anything in that interview
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.200]   that you kind of want to touch on in terms of like,
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.760]   yeah, that you saw or the questions that were asked?
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.080]   - So first of all, the first thing I thought
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.400]   was I wanted to give her a hug, right?
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:24.400]   And be like, hey, I'm sorry if law enforcement let you down.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.000]   I'm sorry if you perceive the law enforcement let you down
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.400]   and that's never our intent.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:34.200]   But one of the things that I saw in that interview
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.840]   was like when she actually finally did go and tell the police
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.200]   and they asked her for a written statement
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.600]   that she didn't want to provide a written statement.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   She wasn't at that point yet in her healing
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.800]   and I get that, right?
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.880]   For police officers that are investigating sex trafficking,
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:58.400]   oftentimes a victim survivor will be being re-victimized
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:03.560]   by somebody new before they can even file charges
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.560]   on the first person that victimized them.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.640]   And then they don't cooperate.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.680]   They don't show up for court.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.840]   They don't do this.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.200]   So it's frustrating for those cops
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.920]   'cause they want to do the right thing.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.620]   They want to put somebody in jail.
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.600]   They want to get the victim services.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.800]   But because of what those victims got going on in their lives
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.400]   and their minds and those things,
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.560]   they're just not able to put themselves in that situation.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.400]   They find themselves back in drugs,
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.620]   back in being trafficked, all those things.
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.340]   So it's almost like this revolving door
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:38.500]   and it's really difficult for police officers.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.660]   And so they really have to lock somebody in
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:42.940]   on their statement and they're like,
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:44.380]   hey, this is what you're gonna testify to.
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.980]   You're gonna show up for court, right?
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.500]   Because how many times can you get burned
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.920]   and somebody get let off
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.840]   and then you're just throwing your hands up?
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.540]   Like, what do you do?
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:54.380]   - Yeah.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.140]   Yeah, that's, I mean, so they,
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:02.020]   so it's better if they can pretty much cooperate in-
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.220]   - It's huge.
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:07.600]   And I had, it was a really weird case.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.520]   I got asked to do an undercover deal
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.700]   with a girl who was being trafficked.
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:17.100]   And I knew her.
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.260]   I knew her mom and I knew her grandma.
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.580]   And so-
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.340]   - So you had to act like you were gonna buy this girl
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.680]   that you knew pretty much?
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.380]   - I had back out of it.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.220]   I couldn't do it.
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.460]   - Yeah, you had just had someone else do it?
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:30.840]   - Yeah, and so we ended up contacting her,
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.940]   interviewing her.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.900]   She's doing really well right now.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:39.500]   But you could see the progression
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.140]   of just her going from one abuser to another abuser
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.380]   to another abuser.
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:47.620]   And how many times her family tried to pull her out
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.180]   and took her away from it
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.600]   and she would just slide back to it.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.180]   - Yeah.
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.740]   Yeah, when I was talking to Kat,
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.140]   what really caught my attention was the fact that,
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.740]   you know, the dude who was doing the selling,
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.140]   he got caught.
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.740]   All those men with weird fetishes
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.580]   that buy these young women,
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.020]   they, a lot of times, get away with it.
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.620]   And they could be just regular married guys
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.780]   with a family at home that are showing up to,
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.600]   you know, a hotel room to molest a kid or whatever.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.940]   Is there a lot of so-called like normal people
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:25.460]   with normal lives that are involved in this type of stuff?
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:29.080]   - So, and one of the reasons that's so difficult
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.640]   is because once we know a 14-year-old's being trafficked,
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.660]   we have to do everything to stop it, right?
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.700]   It's not like you can see how many.
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.860]   And so, the amount of, you know,
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.140]   different layers they put to protect themselves
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:46.440]   on who they trafficked the person to
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.820]   versus the protections that the people
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.380]   who the 14-year-old got trafficked to took,
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.420]   it makes it really hard to go back and do those.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.620]   - To retrace kind of the conversation
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.820]   they had with what people?
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.980]   - Yeah, and, you know, having, you know,
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:05.180]   been undercover as someone who's purchasing that,
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.540]   it's just so sad.
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:10.180]   Like, it was funny, like,
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:13.220]   I would just sit in a room and talk to 'em.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:18.140]   Like, you know, it's like $300 for an hour or whatever.
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:22.420]   And they wanted to do everything but have sex.
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.700]   And if they thought they could get away
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.960]   with just talking to you for an hour,
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.740]   they would just be like, this is, you know, easy money.
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:31.380]   - So, you had to talk to the children?
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.580]   - Yeah, the girls, like, as an undercover.
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:37.820]   But, so, a lot of times when you, you know,
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:39.900]   identify yourself as police, all those kind of things,
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.340]   then they clam up.
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.300]   But if you're a John and you're just sitting there
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.340]   and you're asking them about their life,
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.980]   then they're willing to tell you anything
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.700]   to not have to perform a sex act.
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.300]   So, they'll sit there and talk to you.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.220]   So, it's a completely consensual conversation.
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:58.980]   So, there's no rights violations or anything like that.
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.960]   So, I would try to get as much,
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.320]   if we're gonna meet with, you know, girls that night,
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.700]   why don't I sit in the room with 'em
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:06.940]   and talk to 'em for 30 or 45 minutes
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.900]   and see how much information I can gain from them
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:14.020]   before the police come in and they arrest the pimp outside,
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:15.140]   all those kind of things.
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.480]   Because she might be more willing
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.340]   to tell me a lot of information.
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.540]   Or if not, I can get a lot of information.
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:24.060]   But then when she's interviewed by a forensic specialist,
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.100]   then they're gonna be able to use a lot of that information
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.040]   and have a lot more knowledge
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.980]   when they try to engage with her and get her services.
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:33.260]   - So, as an undercover agent,
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:37.100]   why can't you, you know, meet with these children that you,
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.640]   is this talking to 'em in person or is it online?
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:41.480]   - In person.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.360]   - So, like, why can't you just walk into a room
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:47.100]   and see that this guy has these children and on the spot?
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.900]   - So, they do it all, it's like all outcalls.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.800]   So, we'll either set up a house or a hotel room
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.060]   and those kind of things.
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:58.520]   The child will come to the front door.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.920]   There's a car sitting, you know, three blocks away.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.980]   You got a surveillance team watching that.
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:04.820]   Bring the kid in.
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.620]   And then you have to make sure that they're there
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.580]   to, you know, perform a sex act.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.680]   - You have to, like, get certified proof.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.700]   - Right, so you're just making all those steps.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.700]   And so, my thought when doing that was, like,
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.860]   why not get as much information while I can?
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.820]   'Cause the car's sitting there outside,
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.260]   like, nothing's gonna happen, so.
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.980]   - Dang, that is crazy to me.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.340]   I had a 16-year-old girl with a pistol in her pocket.
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.500]   I was pretty sure she was gonna try to rob me, so.
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.340]   - Really?
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.700]   - Yeah.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:36.260]   - Dude, that is a crazy job to work in, like, that is.
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:38.580]   Do you have a lot of trauma, like, now about that?
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:40.080]   Or it just, like, not?
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.980]   - I don't have a lot of trauma about it.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:50.420]   I know a lot of people who have done what I do
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:51.640]   have a lot of trauma.
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:54.660]   I feel fortunate.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.100]   I feel like I have a great family.
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:00.020]   I have great friends that understand what I go through.
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.900]   - Yeah, we need people like you, you know what I mean?
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.940]   Like, if there was no guys like you willing
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.640]   to put themselves in these situations, you know,
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:11.100]   we wouldn't rescue these kids in the first place.
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:14.620]   What is your thought on corrupt cops?
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:17.660]   Is there, or corrupt, like, special agents?
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.220]   I've always wondered that because, like, you know,
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.860]   you hear the stories about the same guys
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.620]   that are supposed to be, you know, saving people
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:25.100]   are also involved in the same thing
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.620]   that they're trying to help, or whatever.
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.140]   Is that common, or no?
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:28.980]   Have you seen that?
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:29.940]   - I've never seen that.
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.700]   I mean, I've seen corruption.
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:36.700]   Like, you know, I work for the Treasury Department
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.740]   and see people that would, you know,
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.020]   inappropriately access IRS data, or whatever,
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.840]   you know, on their ex-spouse, or something like that, right?
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.020]   That's corruption.
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.940]   I haven't seen any widespread corruption.
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:51.140]   I know that it occurs.
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.300]   I'm not naive to that fact.
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:57.260]   In the federal government, I think it happens way, way less
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:59.660]   than in certain, like, local police departments.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:02.820]   I know people in local police departments
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.400]   where there has been some widespread corruption.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:10.180]   And it's disheartening, it becomes a culture.
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.580]   With the federal government,
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:15.160]   the prerequisites in getting into it,
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.060]   the amount of training, the amount of moving around,
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.060]   the amount of just time it takes to get it done,
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:24.020]   is, I think, you know, restrictive.
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:25.980]   A lot of smaller police departments, you know,
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.400]   they're hiring somebody for $40,000 a year.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.140]   Federal agents make it $120,000 a year, you know?
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:35.580]   So, it's a lot easier to fall into corruption
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.740]   when you're in tough times yourself.
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:39.140]   - Yeah.
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:40.460]   I mean, yeah.
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.420]   I totally agree with that.
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:47.260]   What is the way that these people communicate
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.380]   to where it's untraceable?
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.260]   Is it through the door?
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.900]   'Cause I think a lot of people have these,
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.000]   like, these thoughts about the dark web.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.180]   Like, what can you communicate on with someone
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:57.860]   to where you can never be traced?
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:01.180]   - So, the dark web was,
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:03.860]   do you know why the dark web exists?
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.380]   - I mean, I'll say is I've gotten on the dark web
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:08.860]   before I had a brother who somehow downloaded the server.
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.180]   I'm not a tech-savvy dude,
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.460]   but he somehow got me on the dark web.
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:14.140]   And, like, the stuff that was accessible on there,
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.420]   and the links you could click,
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.580]   it was crazy. - Drugs, fake IDs, girls,
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:19.420]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.460]   - It was the craziest stuff.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:23.620]   Like, I remember clicking one link
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.460]   where it was just, like, I just wanted to see.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:29.120]   It was, like, I think it was, like,
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:29.980]   there was all these different links,
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:32.060]   and one of them was, like, videos about,
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:34.900]   I don't even know, suicide videos,
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.820]   just stuff that could never be on the regular internet,
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.300]   or it might be, like, torturing videos,
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:42.580]   or, you know, you can buy, like, guns or whatever it is.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.740]   But I couldn't believe the stuff that was on there.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:48.420]   But is that the avenue these guys use to communicate,
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.260]   or what?
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:54.300]   - I would say probably less than 50% of 'em use the dark web.
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:58.580]   The dark web was created by the US government.
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:02.900]   And what it was created for was
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:07.900]   to allow, like, dissidents in Iran or in China
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:11.060]   to be able to communicate without it being traced
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:14.460]   or intercepted by those foreign governments, right?
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.060]   So that's why it was created,
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.340]   and you have your user,
[00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:20.460]   and then you have these nodes that it goes through.
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:22.060]   Like, it's complicated.
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:27.060]   But the biggest way,
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.700]   and probably something we haven't even touched on yet,
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.660]   is these people are acting,
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.940]   is on online platforms where kids are at.
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:41.180]   They're stalking kids on, you know, all these different,
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:45.300]   you know, I don't wanna throw any certain one out there,
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.540]   but there's all these different pages, you know,
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:51.380]   where kids congregate and they stay things and do things.
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:54.580]   And that's where they're going,
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.380]   and they're getting kids to produce material.
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.380]   And one of the biggest trends,
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:59.780]   one of the biggest upsetting things
[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:01.780]   is what's called sextortion,
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.740]   which is getting a kid to take a nude photo,
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.860]   pretending to be a kid their same age
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.340]   and be in love with them.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:09.900]   And then they send the photo,
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.140]   and then they find out that that's an adult male.
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:14.740]   And now that they have one nude photo,
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.940]   they say, "I'm gonna send this to all your friends,
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.180]   "everybody in your school.
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:20.980]   "Gonna give it to your parents, your church,
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:23.860]   "if you don't take more nude photos for me."
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.780]   And so then they force these kids
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:29.660]   into abusing themselves for their pleasure
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.220]   on these online platforms.
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.060]   - Dang, yeah.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.380]   I remember talking to the CRC and they were like,
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:36.540]   you know, these guys will even go on,
[00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:39.140]   say, like a Fortnite video game or whatever it is
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:43.020]   where kids just get on and, you know, get cool with them,
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.180]   make them feel comfortable,
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:47.300]   and then the, like, stuff can start to happen.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:50.700]   - I, I'll tell a personal story.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.980]   I have, in my family, we call,
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:55.900]   my cousin's kids call me uncle,
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.140]   and I call them my nieces and nephews.
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:04.140]   Probably about 15 years ago,
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:07.020]   I got a call from my niece
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:09.900]   and said that there's a creepy guy at my house.
[00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:12.900]   So it's like eight o'clock in the morning.
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:16.500]   I grab my gun, jump in my truck, head to her house.
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.140]   Nobody's there.
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:19.460]   I go knock on the door.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:20.300]   She opens the door.
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:22.340]   I talk to her and I say, "What's going on?"
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:24.420]   She's like, "I met this guy online."
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:28.500]   And I was like, "Why does he know your address?"
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.380]   She's like, "Well, I gave him my address."
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:33.540]   And I'm like, "Oh, first problem, right?"
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.140]   And, you know, this guy had started out
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.660]   pretending he was, like, 26,
[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:41.060]   and she was, like, 17 or whatever, 16.
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:44.660]   And so they started this relationship.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:46.460]   Well, by the time it got to the end
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:47.580]   when he showed up at the house,
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:51.300]   it's a 53-year-old dude, and she doesn't let him in.
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:52.820]   And so I'm talking to her,
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:56.500]   and she gets a message from the guy.
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.020]   And he says, "It's okay, baby.
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:00.940]   "We can just have phone sex instead."
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:04.240]   And so I was like, "No, tell him to come back.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:06.500]   "Tell him you were in the shower and come back."
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:11.500]   So this six-foot-three, 350-pound, 53-year-old
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.260]   shows up at my aunt's door
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:17.020]   to have sex with my 16-year-old niece.
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:19.100]   - And you got him right there.
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:20.100]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.060]   Yeah, we had a talk.
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:25.340]   I called the police, and while we waited for them to come,
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:29.180]   we had a discussion about how sorry he was.
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.900]   And I told him, "Yeah, you're only sorry
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:33.500]   "'cause you got caught."
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:34.900]   - And he went to jail?
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:36.500]   - Yeah.
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.860]   - Dang, man.
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:42.940]   Did she say how her and that dude met?
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:45.980]   - It was on just an internet chat program.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:51.820]   But no matter who you are,
[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:54.460]   this is where kids are getting abused,
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.820]   is by people they trust, right?
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:01.820]   And pedophiles are creating trust online to abuse your kids.
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.540]   - Have you ever had to shoot one of these dudes?
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:06.620]   - No, I've never shot anybody in my life.
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:07.460]   - Really?
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:08.300]   - Yeah.
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:09.140]   - You're lucky.
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:09.980]   - Yep.
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:11.620]   - Yeah, our team security was telling me a story,
[00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:14.900]   'cause they also, the guy that does our team security
[00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:17.820]   also had to do some undercover stuff just here in Denver
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.820]   with like normal, I don't think it was,
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:21.500]   it definitely wasn't child trafficking,
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:24.620]   but it was prostitution, and he would, you know, undercover,
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.020]   like he was meeting up with these girls,
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.660]   and then he would, same type of thing,
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.220]   and he was telling me some of those stories.
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:34.220]   So yeah, I bet there's some crazy situations
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:36.020]   you ran into.
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.060]   - There are, there are.
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:38.300]   - Well, how old are you now?
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:40.140]   - I'm 50 years old.
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:42.300]   - So you were just, this is time to give this up.
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.380]   - Well, I became eligible to retire at 50.
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.220]   - Yeah.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:49.180]   - And so on the very first day I was eligible to retire,
[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:53.740]   I retired, and I took three new jobs
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:56.340]   within 10 days of retiring.
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:55:01.260]   So I work for the Indomitian Sioux Family Foundation,
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:05.500]   and a company called, or a non-profit
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.100]   called Operation Light Shine,
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.140]   and Operation Light Shine works with the Thiebaud Foundation
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:13.100]   to build out centers and pay for cops
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:14.740]   to get the best technology,
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:16.700]   and to pay for the salaries of cops
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:19.300]   to work together in collaboration centers
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:23.500]   to combat the problem of child exploitation.
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.660]   And then I took a job with a private company
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:29.420]   who does facial recognition technology,
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:34.700]   and through my career I can absolutely say
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:39.060]   that I'm aware of over 1,000 children
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:41.820]   that were identified by using this technology.
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.940]   And so I was really excited to get to go work
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.060]   for that company too.
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:47.700]   - Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.980]   Is there any, 'cause my big thing that I like to talk about
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:53.900]   is just the things that go on in this world,
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:57.100]   the conspiracy theories, I guess is what you would say.
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:01.300]   Is there any that you are kind of like
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:02.580]   knowledgeable or passionate about,
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:04.620]   or some things that you didn't really get to speak on
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:09.260]   during your career that you can tell us about,
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:11.380]   or things like that?
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:13.660]   - No.
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:14.660]   - Things that'll blow our mind?
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:15.860]   - No.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:18.340]   - The world is what it seems.
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:22.020]   - No, it isn't, but there's none that I can comment on.
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.900]   - But there's things you know?
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.060]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:27.100]   - You just can't talk about 'em for, what,
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:30.100]   more safety on your family's side,
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.460]   or is it things that you just--
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.140]   - No, it's ongoing.
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:34.940]   - Oh, ongoing things. - Investigation, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:35.780]   - Got you.
[00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:36.820]   - Yeah.
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:39.460]   - Well, when it's not, well, I need to hear,
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.220]   I need to hear stuff off camera.
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:42.300]   (laughing)
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:45.260]   But man, no, I really appreciate you getting on here.
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:50.860]   And you know, this, as someone who this issue,
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.100]   for some reason, it's always kind of like,
[00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:55.580]   it's something that's kind of touched my heart.
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:59.380]   I appreciate you doing your job and helping so many people,
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:02.220]   and kind of sharing your story.
[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:06.060]   And yeah, man, I wish you all the best in retirement.
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:08.620]   I wish you, you know, a lot of peace,
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.100]   and a lot of joy in the rest of your life.
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:11.220]   - I appreciate it.
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:12.620]   - Yeah, man, is there anything else
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:13.740]   you wanna get off your chest?
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:15.180]   Or I feel like we covered a lot.
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:16.020]   I feel like that--
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:16.980]   - Yeah, if you ever wanna have me back,
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:18.660]   if you come up with like, 10 more guests,
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:20.100]   and you got questions that you wanna kind of
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:23.020]   wrap back around to, or maybe some of these investigations
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:24.820]   we can get over with, and we can talk again.
[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:26.260]   - 100% man, thank you.
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.460]   Curious Mike out.
[00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:30.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:31.700]   Thank you, bro.
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:33.580]   - Wait, I have some questions.
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:37.020]   One, the guy that was abusing the two-year-olds,
[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:39.460]   how did he get two-year-olds?
[00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:41.700]   - Mom was an alcoholic and a prostitute.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:45.740]   She would go out and drink and run tricks,
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:48.860]   and he offered to stay back there with her babies,
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:49.700]   two-year-olds.
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:50.940]   - He would just like, babysit people's kids?
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:51.940]   'Cause it wasn't just those kids.
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:52.820]   - Just her kids.
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:54.100]   Like, he kind of had like,
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:56.700]   a friendship relationship with her.
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:58:00.580]   He actually did kidnap one girl off of a playground
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.940]   outside of his apartment building and abuse her,
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:04.700]   but then he let her go,
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.540]   and she went home and didn't tell anybody.
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:09.660]   So we only knew that he did it because of the pictures.
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:11.940]   He abused the nine-year-old older sister
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:13.540]   of the two-year-olds.
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:15.580]   He would feed her, like, cough syrup,
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:18.420]   and get her to fall asleep, and then abuse her.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.940]   I forget who else he abused, but--
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:22.260]   - Oh, it was so disgusting.
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:25.500]   - Did you hear about the Drake and Josh documentary?
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.740]   The Nickelodeon, have you seen that?
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:29.180]   - I haven't seen it yet.
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:33.220]   - The Nickelodeon documentary,
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:34.780]   just about how many of those dudes,
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.980]   and how many of those dudes in that,
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:40.660]   that man, they were, like, the guy at Drake and Josh,
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:42.380]   that dude was getting molested.
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:44.580]   But like, a lot of 'em in Nickelodeon
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:48.300]   were like, doing that to these kids on these child shows.
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:49.140]   It was like a big thing.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:50.980]   Like, a lot of these kids are messed up now.
[00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:52.500]   - How is it that?
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:54.300]   - That's why I think it's so much bigger.
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.940]   Like, that's why I think there's higher things
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:59:01.020]   that are running some weird organized ring type stuff.
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.740]   - I wonder if it's organized, or if they just like--
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:04.420]   - Hunter Biden.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:06.100]   - That's the son of Joe Biden, right?
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:08.820]   You wanna know a crazy story about him?
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:09.660]   - Yeah.
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:11.860]   - This dude, 'cause I know a girl, right,
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:16.500]   who was telling me about these sex parties in L.A.
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:20.020]   This dude got kicked out of this sex party in L.A.
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.820]   She was telling me, kind of, what goes on,
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:23.460]   how they're doing, like, all this.
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:24.500]   You walk from room to room,
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.540]   and you see different celebrities,
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:26.780]   and different politicians.
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:28.220]   You know, a lot of 'em have the masks on.
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:30.300]   But, you know, the girl I was talking to is pretty famous,
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:31.380]   and she was telling me what goes on
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:33.300]   at these sex parties in L.A.
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:35.540]   That same dude, Hunter Biden, was at the same one,
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:38.260]   and he got kicked out of the sex party,
[00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:40.740]   or the sex, like, club, because he,
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:42.940]   I guess one of the rules is you have to ask before you touch,
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:44.860]   and he was, like, disrespecting the women in there,
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:45.700]   or whatever.
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:47.780]   But, yeah, that's a bad guy right there.
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:50.940]   Yeah, he is, and he's got some younger people
[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:54.540]   than were 18 on the list there, too.
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:55.380]   - Really?
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:56.220]   - Yeah.
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:57.260]   - Okay, I have more questions.
[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.780]   'Cause you were in the Pacific Northwest, right?
[00:59:58.780 --> 00:59:59.620]   - Yes, ma'am.
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.300]   - This guy that I knew,
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:04.540]   'cause at the time I had a boyfriend up there,
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:07.420]   and his father worked at his church.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.260]   He worked at the church.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.700]   He worked with, like, college-age students.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:12.100]   Like, he was, like, a seemingly great guy.
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.580]   Had a YouTube talking about God,
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.540]   talking about Jesus, da-da-da-da-da.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:18.580]   - A year or two now ago, he got arrested for,
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:20.340]   have you heard of Isaac Chirac?
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.860]   He got arrested for trafficking girls into Seattle.
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.620]   He was, like, someone, like, we kicked it with.
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.460]   Like, we knew him.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.740]   He was, like, normal, nice, like, worshiped Jesus.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.580]   - Really?
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.420]   - Yes.
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:32.820]   - I arrested a guy who, he molested his daughter.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.420]   She was, like, 10 or 11.
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.500]   He got sent to prison for 10 years.
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.140]   He got out, joined a church,
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:41.340]   got on the missionary group for the church,
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.540]   went to Africa, found a lady there
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.740]   to marry who had two daughters
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:50.180]   and started abusing both of her daughters in Kenya.
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:53.660]   - So people just really use the church as a cover,
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.500]   which leads me to my last question.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.900]   Why do you think it's so prevalent
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.660]   with, like, Catholic priests?
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:01.500]   - I have no clue.
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.700]   Like, I think that's just child rape.
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:05.540]   You know what I mean?
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.300]   I don't think they're filming it, they're doing anything.
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.580]   I haven't had any investigations into the Catholic church,
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:12.140]   but I totally agree with you.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.260]   And I think it's just, like,
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:16.820]   once that kind of infection starts
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:18.740]   and you keep those people on
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:23.300]   and they bring on other people, it's like, just, uh--
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.660]   - So do you think it's like--
[01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:26.620]   - You're right, though, bro, it is the porn,
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:31.540]   because, like, you get desensitized to normal stuff
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:33.020]   and you need weird stuff.
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:35.180]   And then, I bet you that's how a lot of this stuff happens.
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.100]   - Also, like, the Catholic priest,
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:38.540]   do you think that there's a part of it
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:39.940]   that's, like, because of the job
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:41.140]   where they're not allowed to get married,
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:42.300]   they're not allowed to have sex with women?
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:43.300]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.380]   They, they, they-- - Yeah.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:47.380]   - It's gotta be, they can't-- - It's gotta be.
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:48.780]   - Yeah, it's gotta be.
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.820]   They're supposed to be celibate for life,
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.740]   but those people who are supposed to be celibate,
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:54.180]   they end up doing wild stuff.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.300]   - Yeah.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.500]   That's always the most wild ones
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.420]   are the ones that are the quietest, shy ones.
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:02.540]   - It's just wild to me that this is such a,
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.420]   like, you would think this is, like, a freak issue
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:07.660]   that only, like, a very few number of people deal with,
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:09.620]   but, like you said, it's just so widespread
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:11.740]   and I think that's the scariest part.
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.740]   - Oh. - Like, our.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:14.580]   - That was good, man.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:15.420]   I thought it was good.
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:16.260]   What'd you think, Cedric?
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.100]   - Yeah, I thought it was good.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.020]   I thought you, I thought it was, like,
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.540]   super natural to just blow everything up.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.700]   - Yeah, I did too.
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:21.860]   Good, good, good.
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:23.660]   - You're good at talking.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.980]   - Oh, try being an undercover for a few years.
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:27.820]   - Oh yeah, you gotta-- - You gotta, like,
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:29.900]   bullshit yourself out of a few situations.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.140]   - Give your P's and Q's.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:32.300]   - I have something that's called
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.940]   essential tremor syndrome.
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:36.260]   It's been getting worse as I get older, so I'll shake.
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.060]   - Yeah. - And, uh,
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:40.260]   and so, when I'm under a lot of stress,
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.340]   it gets really bad.
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.420]   Like, it'll be really noticeable.
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:48.420]   And so, I had to, I had to buy a bunch of fentanyl last year.
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:51.180]   So I had to go meet this dude to buy, you know,
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.300]   a couple thousand pills of fentanyl.
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.220]   And I'm like, fuck, I'm just gonna be shaking
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.260]   like a motherfucker.
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.300]   So I'm texting with him beforehand.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:01.020]   I'm like, hey dude, I can't do this shit
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.740]   'cause I have early onset Parkinson's
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:06.140]   and it'll fuck with my medication, stuff like that.
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.380]   And I just threw it in this, like, subtle text.
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:10.820]   And so then, when I went, I noticed myself shaking.
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.740]   I'm like, it's fucking Parkinson's, man.
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:13.900]   This shit's gonna be bad.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:16.900]   And I'm just like, it's not, it's not Parkinson's at all,
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.300]   but it's like, you know what I mean?
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:19.940]   Let me use my weakness as my strength.
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:21.980]   Like, who's thinking that somebody's gonna be at the top
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:22.820]   and has Parkinson's?
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.060]   - Right. - Right.
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:27.500]   - Nah, dude, I bet it is crazy
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.380]   having to work undercover and just, like,
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:30.420]   put on that persona.
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.300]   Like, you're one of these freaks, you know?
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.860]   - Yes. - Like, they have to watch
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:35.700]   every minute of it.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:36.660]   - You're literally an actor.
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.900]   You're like a professional actor.
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:39.780]   - I would just take confessions that I got
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:41.340]   'cause I love to do interviews.
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:43.300]   I would interview, and so I had a bunch of people
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:45.100]   that I interviewed and they would confess everything to me
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.380]   and tell me all about it.
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:49.940]   Like, the guy from Africa, he confessed everything.
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:50.780]   - Yeah.
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.380]   - And so I would just make their story my own.
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.380]   And I would just, that would be my story.
