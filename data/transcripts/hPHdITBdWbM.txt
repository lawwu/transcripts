[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.960]   - Happy Monday, everybody.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.160]   Welcome back and thank you for listening
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.880]   to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.760]   Pastor John joins us today remotely over Skype.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.760]   Our question today comes from a listener named Sam
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.780]   who lives in Los Angeles.
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.920]   He sent in a really short question to us,
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.920]   but it's an important one.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.880]   Dear Pastor John, what do you love most about God?
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.720]   That's it.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.840]   Pastor John, what do you love most about God?
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.080]   - In a sense, to answer this question authentically,
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.600]   I probably ought not to spend any great time
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.880]   theologizing, right?
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.880]   Or studying or doing exegesis or assessing God's attributes.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.840]   I ought to simply blurt out,
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.360]   blurt out what I feel about God,
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.840]   what I really treasure about Him and value and admire.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.480]   Wouldn't that be the most authentic answer to the question,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.800]   what do I love about God,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.080]   rather than some long studied,
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.040]   complicated Philip and APJ theological answer?
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.920]   And I think the answer to that question is yes, that's right.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.520]   So that's where I'll start.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.520]   My first, most visceral, immediate, heartfelt answer
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.080]   to the question is I love the grace of God.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.760]   I love the mercy of God.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.880]   I love being loved by God.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.080]   I love being treated graciously and kindly
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.960]   and patiently by God.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.600]   I love being accepted and forgiven by God.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.680]   I love God's grace towards me.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.640]   I think all of those statements
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.720]   that just tumbled out there are ways of saying
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.600]   the grace of God is very, very, very precious to me.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.840]   I would be undone without a God of grace.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.800]   Late at night, early in the morning,
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.280]   facing conflict, facing guilt feelings,
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.280]   facing judgment from Him ultimately, possibly,
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.000]   or from critical people facing the world.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I would be undone without the grace of God.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.400]   It is on the front burner of my affections for God
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.240]   all of the time.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.800]   And I mean that even when I'm thinking about
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   all kinds of other attributes of God or ways of God,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.000]   they're all flavored with the grace of God.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.840]   So that's my most visceral, heartfelt, unreflective,
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.480]   immediate, desperate response to the question
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.520]   of what I love most about God.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.840]   But the reason I said that answering this way
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.840]   is in a sense the right way to answer this question
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.120]   is that there's another sense in which the Bible
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.120]   encourages us not just to speak from our inmost
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.880]   or most immediate perception of things,
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.080]   but to ponder in the light of God's word
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.440]   and in the light of God's action, what we mean,
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.600]   what we mean by what we most immediately say
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.400]   and whether there might be contained
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   in this immediate response aspects of God's grace
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.120]   and mercy and kindness, which need to be made explicit
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.840]   for the sake of our own souls,
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.160]   as well as for the sake of others.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.280]   Lest we fail to honor God as we ought
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.120]   and lest we subconsciously find ourselves loving not God,
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.700]   supremely, but our own selves.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.760]   There are numerous instances in the Bible
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.120]   where people showed some measure
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.740]   of spontaneous devotion to God.
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.740]   And then when he said something or did something
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.800]   that they didn't like, their devotion evaporated,
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   which means that what they said was love for God
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.000]   wasn't really love for the true God,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.240]   but only a love for their imagined God,
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.880]   their picture of God.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.760]   And then the real God does something out of step
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.860]   with their expectations and their love is gone.
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.460]   Now that love was not really love for God.
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.660]   So even though it's right, and I'm gonna say it again,
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.660]   it's right for me to give a spontaneous, heartfelt,
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.460]   visceral gut reaction to the question,
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.740]   what I love most about God,
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.500]   every person who lives under the authority of the Bible,
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.280]   including me, will want to discern
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.080]   from the true real God revealed in the Bible,
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.960]   whether what I'm saying corresponds to reality.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.960]   Is God really like what I say I love about him?
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.720]   And is my heart so much attuned to the true God
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.040]   that no matter what he reveals about himself,
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.220]   I will still be totally committed to him
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.900]   and in love with him and valuing him and treasuring him
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.120]   and cherishing him and being satisfied in him.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.340]   Then with the Bible's help,
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.580]   I'll know that I love the true God
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.580]   and not just a figment of my own religious imagination.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.420]   So what John Piper needs to do,
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.860]   having given his immediate heartfelt answer,
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.380]   I love the grace of God toward me in Jesus.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.380]   What he needs to do, what I need to do is ask,
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.900]   Piper, what do you mean by the grace of God?
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.680]   If you love that most,
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.200]   you should have some sense of what you're talking about.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.680]   You know, those are just empty words.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.660]   And my answer would be this.
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.400]   So now I'm doing the reflective thing,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.000]   testing my guts, right, and my spontaneity.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   God's grace is his disposition and action
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.140]   to give the greatest possible blessing
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.700]   to the least deserving creatures at the greatest cost.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.480]   That's my definition of God's grace.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.280]   The cost is the suffering and death
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.060]   of his one and only son, Jesus Christ.
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.060]   Romans 8, 32, he did not spare his own son,
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.480]   but gave him up for us all.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.440]   The least deserving creatures are human beings, me,
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.240]   who have desecrated God's glory by committing treason
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.280]   in preferring other things above God.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.400]   Like Romans 5, 6, and 8 says,
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.880]   "Christ died for the ungodly."
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.360]   God shows his love for us
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.160]   and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.880]   And then thirdly, the greatest possible blessing
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.960]   purchased at the greatest cost
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.120]   for the least deserving is pause.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.080]   Think, hmm, now what's that?
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.080]   And at this point, we are at the most critical juncture.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.440]   How shall we state the greatest possible blessing
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.440]   that grace gives to the least deserving recipients like me?
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.200]   And it won't work to say,
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.840]   "Well, the greatest possible gift of God's grace
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.080]   is the grace."
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.760]   That's just talking in circles.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.560]   That's not gonna answer the question.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.560]   So you can see why it's an inadequate answer
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.760]   when John Piper says that the greatest thing I love
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.280]   about God is his grace,
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.320]   until I've answered the question,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.520]   what's the greatest blessing that God's grace
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.120]   has given to me in treating me so much better
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.160]   than I deserve at the cost of his son's life?
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.160]   To love the grace of God in a way that honors God
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.280]   is to love grace because of the specific content
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.280]   of the blessing given by the grace of God, namely God.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:07.000]   The greatest gift grace gives is God
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.200]   for our eternal friendship and enjoyment.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   1 Peter 3:18, "Christ also suffered once for sins,
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.560]   the righteous for the unrighteous,
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.240]   that he might bring us to God."
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.800]   Romans 5:10, "While we were enemies,
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.560]   we were reconciled to God by the death of his son."
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.560]   The grace John Piper says he loves about God
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.960]   is not the grace of God,
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.880]   unless the capstone of that grace
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.760]   is the gift of God himself.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.560]   And the love that I say I have for that grace
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.040]   is not a love for God,
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.160]   unless what I love most about the grace
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.480]   is that it brings me to God.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.480]   And I think this is why in Ephesians 1,
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.840]   Paul says that the eternal election of God
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.840]   and his predestination and his planned adoption
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.600]   of redeemed people through Christ,
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.120]   all according to the good pleasure of his will,
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.360]   has as its ultimate goal, quote,
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.360]   "The praise of the glory of the grace of God."
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.720]   And that glory, the glory of grace,
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.680]   is the beauty of how all the attributes
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.680]   of the eternal God, his goodness, his righteousness,
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.080]   his unimpeachable justice, his unfathomable wisdom,
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.360]   his omnipotent power,
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.360]   how all that he is in his godness and his holiness,
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.240]   how all of that unites,
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.600]   fits together beautifully to plan and perform
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.000]   creation and redemption in a way
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.240]   that magnifies the capstone of his deity,
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.680]   namely the glory of his grace.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.360]   In other words, the eternal excellencies of God
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.880]   give rise to the wise ways of God
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.000]   for the praise of the glory of the grace of God.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   So that when we say we love the grace of God,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.840]   we ought to mean that we have some sense
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.840]   of those eternal excellencies and those wise ways of God.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.280]   All of which brings me back to where I began.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.880]   I love the grace of God,
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:49.240]   which now means I love that he is the kind of God
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.240]   who didn't spare his own son.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.760]   I love that he's the kind of God who justifies the ungodly.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.400]   I love that he's the kind of God that gives
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.360]   to the least deserving, the greatest blessing,
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.360]   namely himself, and I hope to be spending
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:13.520]   the rest of eternity knowing and loving
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.880]   all of his excellencies better and better.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.720]   - Amen.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.840]   Yes, a proper hope and prayer for all of us.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.040]   This whole episode is reminding me of your book,
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.680]   Pastor John, "God is the Gospel."
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.520]   So good.

[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.800]   Well, one of the most common questions we get
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.840]   in the inbox is about lukewarmness.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.320]   Am I lukewarm?
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.880]   And what is lukewarmness to begin with?
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.800]   We will work toward a definition
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.960]   when we return next time on Wednesday.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.960]   We'll see you then.
