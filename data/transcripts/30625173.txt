[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.460]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.160]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.020]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.240]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.680]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.460]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.880]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.980]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.040]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.020]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.860]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.320]   But don't forget,
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.120]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.120]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.560]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.600]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.480]   Well, listeners, I know that we are cruising
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.760]   toward the end of the academic year.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.120]   For many of you,
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.740]   you may be in your last week or two
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.300]   of Foundations and Essentials.
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.300]   And I have heard lots of families thinking out loud lately
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.940]   about what to do when community ends.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.360]   I mean, it seems too early to a lot of us
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.240]   to be done with school.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.580]   And for another thing,
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.020]   what are we gonna do with all that extra time?
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.880]   We're used to having one full day in community
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.600]   and lots of activities that we do with our students,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.740]   with our children together to get ready for community day.
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.520]   So now what are we gonna do?
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.580]   Now listen, I'm specifically talking about
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.580]   that sliver of time between the end of community
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.280]   and full out summer break, okay?
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.940]   I know that we all have lots of things
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.280]   we're looking forward to doing on summer break.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.080]   But if you are thinking,
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.040]   I don't know if I'm done with school yet,
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.500]   should I be done with school?
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.120]   Could I be done with school?
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.120]   What should school look like with my children
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.760]   after community days are done?
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.200]   So we're gonna talk about it today.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.840]   And I have one of my favorite friends with me
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.840]   who never fails to offer wisdom that you can use.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.040]   Amy Jones is here with me today.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.200]   Amy, I'm so excited to talk to you about this.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.640]   - Oh, thank you, Lisa.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.880]   This was a great theme to ponder.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.880]   It brought back a lot of memories for me.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.920]   So yeah, I'm delighted to be here
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.920]   and rehearse some of those wisdom bits
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.840]   that God taught me.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.960]   - Yes, well, I wondered as I was thinking
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.080]   about who would like to talk to me about this,
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.760]   I figured that you and I had similar stories.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.760]   And I can remember thinking, we're done?
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.600]   Are we really done?
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.760]   And I had some girlfriends who were afraid to be done.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.640]   They were afraid to let their kids
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.380]   look like they were done with school
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.800]   for fear they would be judged as homeschoolers
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.000]   for not doing enough.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And listen, listeners, we beat ourselves up all the time
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.880]   about not doing enough.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.920]   What even is that?
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.840]   If the Lord has called you to homeschool,
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.600]   He's called you to do all manner of things
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.720]   with your children and not just academic things.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.680]   So stop, let's all make a pact to stop worrying
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.900]   if we have done enough and ponder some ways
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.000]   to use this time between the end of community
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.800]   and full out summer break to draw closer to our families,
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.160]   to draw our families closer to the Lord
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.080]   and just enjoy one another.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.840]   That's what Amy and I wanna talk about today.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.560]   Amy, do you remember how you felt
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.960]   about the end of the homeschooling year?
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   Like when community was over, were you glad or sad?
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.340]   Were you relieved or disappointed?
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.040]   - Well, a little bit of each one of those, actually.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.420]   That transition was always a bit of a bump
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.140]   and which is so funny.
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.140]   It was a surprise every year until I realized May
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.300]   and it was May for us, the month of May.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.720]   May is really like a December.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.720]   I realized that we have, you develop a family culture
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.120]   in your homeschooling family
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.520]   and that culture has its own rhythms
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.520]   and that may be really different
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.640]   than your neighbor's rhythms
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.880]   who have maybe public school kids or private school kids
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.880]   or just other homeschool families.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.940]   They may have a different rhythm
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.180]   and we found that to develop sort of this idea
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.440]   of a family culture,
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.020]   what's that May becomes a celebration
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.100]   and a remembering month.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.940]   - Ah, I love that.
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.580]   - So we set that.
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.580]   I just finally, after kicking against the goats for a year,
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.960]   demanding that we keep schooling until the end of May,
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.980]   that I just recognized that there are so many things
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.820]   going on.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.380]   Usually there's an end of the year celebration
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.860]   in your DC community that you wanna be really a part of
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.580]   and pause to celebrate.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.500]   We always had some kind of recital or play
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   or sports banquet or something at the end of, in May
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.380]   that was coming up.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.380]   Weddings come up, other homeschool graduations come up.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.380]   There are all these moments of culmination and celebration.
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.560]   And I think just anticipating that
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.240]   as you look at your calendar to recognize,
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.200]   hey, these are moments that are really special
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.880]   in our family and I'm gonna set aside time
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.080]   to allow ourselves to really celebrate
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.180]   instead of regret.
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.080]   I just found that frequently I would regret.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.900]   Like I'd look at the stack of books we did not get through
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.820]   or the lessons we did not do.
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.180]   And I felt bad about that because I felt like
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.780]   that sometimes set a tone for my own children
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.420]   that I was somehow disappointed.
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.360]   And that's not true.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.780]   That's a burden that's not theirs.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.780]   And I just really, I would just encourage moms to resist
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.580]   that since I not for myself, I say, even in gratitude,
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.900]   not recognizing all that God has done.
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.460]   And like you said, not just academic,
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.020]   but just seeing, oh, my kindergartner couldn't tie their shoe
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.920]   and now they can tie their shoe or they can get tall
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.100]   or they understand how to maybe make their bed.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.700]   - Yes, yes.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.280]   - Lovely and to recognize that.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.900]   And, you know, my favorite verse that I clung to
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.900]   was in Proverbs 3, 5 verse where it's trust in the Lord,
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.700]   not me, not my curriculum and with all my heart.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.980]   And this is my favorite part.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.420]   And lean not on my own understanding.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.540]   - Yes.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.160]   - Acknowledge Him in all my ways
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.540]   and that He will make the path straight.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.540]   So that was, I tell you that those truths were tried
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.340]   and true in my own family as I recognized.
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.860]   He just has a much richer understanding
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.380]   of my children and my family.
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.940]   And I can trust that even if my boxes weren't ticked,
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.780]   that His were, He was accomplishing His purposes
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.900]   and to really rest in that truth.
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.680]   - Amy, that is so beautiful.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.220]   I hope, listeners, I hope that you,
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.580]   that your shoulders have relaxed two full inches
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.900]   as you listened to Amy.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.340]   You know, Amy, I have to share this with you.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.740]   Something that the Lord brought to me
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.300]   in the last several weeks,
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.900]   I was reading a book called
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.240]   "The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry."
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.540]   And in the book, the author was considering
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.380]   the verses in Matthew that talk about Jesus's yoke
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.760]   and take my yoke upon you,
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.140]   that my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:08.020]   And, okay, I have to fully admit this
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.960]   to everybody within listening distance.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.500]   I've been a Christian for a really long time.
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.380]   I have studied the Word for a really long time.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.340]   I know the Lord, I love the Lord.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.680]   He speaks to me and I respond.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.780]   I never thought about this part of that verse.
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.100]   I mean, I get that the Lord is not giving me
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.360]   the burdensome load that I am putting on my back.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.840]   But you know what a yoke is?
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.900]   A yoke is not something that's made for one.
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.780]   A yoke is made for two.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.820]   And what Jesus is saying to me in that verse
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:54.740]   is that you are yoked with me.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.620]   It's not that I'm giving you a lighter load,
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.580]   it's that I'm carrying the load with you.
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.500]   And so your load is light
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.500]   because I, your God, am carrying it with you.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:15.580]   And I tell you what, when that dawned on me,
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:20.580]   I felt like the weight of 100 chains had fallen off of me.
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:28.260]   God is calling us to do a great and amazing thing
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.300]   and we are doing it in His power,
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:38.720]   in His strength, and with His leading.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.580]   And so get to the end of the year and think,
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.720]   what has God helped us to do?
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.660]   Look what the Lord has enabled us to do
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.940]   and be so glad about that.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.540]   I love what you said, Amy.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.380]   I love it.
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.060]   - Yeah, it's such a truth.
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.220]   And I feel like part of the homeschooling,
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.820]   and we were talking about this earlier,
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.020]   the homeschooling process,
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.940]   frequently we just look, we've been trained
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.020]   and to look at the outcome, you know,
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.700]   what did we accomplish?
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.580]   And that's in very naturalistic terms,
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.580]   you know, a test score or a check mark on an essay,
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.380]   that sort of thing.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.860]   And I think God is really calling us to something
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.100]   so much more satisfying.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.100]   And that means the process of doing a lesson,
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.420]   the process of reading a book,
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.020]   the process of creating a piece of art or poetry
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.860]   or doing a great, you know, penalty kick in a soccer game,
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.780]   that all of those things are meant to always draw us
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:53.780]   into truth about the character and the goodness of God.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.340]   And so, and you've seen this
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.940]   as you've probably taught your daughters,
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.220]   if they wanted to learn how to bake a cake,
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.880]   that frequently it becomes much more
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.780]   than just getting that cake baked.
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.460]   It's a conversation, it's encouragement
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.220]   when things don't go well,
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.900]   it's helping them and they see your love for them,
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.020]   they can see how you enjoy the time,
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.260]   spending the time with them,
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.180]   maybe how you can gently correct or admonish,
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.900]   you know, all of those are, that's all wrapped up in that.
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:31.900]   And that frequently, I think God uses that kind of process,
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:37.540]   that time with us as we're working through something
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.740]   that's hard and homeschooling is doable,
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.100]   we never say it's easy, it's doable.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.020]   But part of the journey that he has for us
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:51.580]   is to learn from him because his burden is light
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.740]   and his yoke is easy.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.820]   And I think that's a check for me
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.700]   when I am feeling that heavy burden
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.660]   and feel frantic and irritable
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.500]   and I'm laying it on other people
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.100]   and blaming situations or circumstances,
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.420]   that's a check to go, "Wait, wait a minute."
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.900]   Because I also love in that verse where he says,
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.260]   "Come to me who are weary and heavy laden."
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.220]   He has identified who we are.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.180]   He knows that we are better than I do.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.020]   And that is such a comfort.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.940]   And so it is, you're right, Lisa,
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.660]   that was a beautiful testimony
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.660]   because that's where I think we can trust starting.
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:35.660]   It's a trust because our world does not allow rest
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.340]   or a hurried life.
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.420]   So it's something we're placing in God.
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.100]   - Yes, I love that.
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.100]   And listeners, parents, if you find yourself weary
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.620]   and weary and weary and anxious and anxious,
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.820]   know that that is not what God has for you.
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.660]   That's not what he's handing you.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.220]   And he doesn't want you to hand that
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.540]   to your children either.
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:05.980]   So stop and take a breath and look instead
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:09.620]   for what is God offering me?
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.180]   What is God showing me?
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.300]   What can I offer my children and what can I offer them?
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.700]   I think it probably has a lot more to do
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.820]   with what Amy was talking about,
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:24.820]   reflecting and celebrating and relationship
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.820]   and process, not outcome and what was finished
[00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.220]   and what we excelled in.
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.740]   So this is an awesome time, in other words,
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:44.740]   when community days are done for you all to sit back
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.660]   and think about what the Lord has done
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.660]   and take a deep breath and rest.
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.420]   Now, here is the truth.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.780]   It is true that just because our CC community
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.620]   is over for the year doesn't mean
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:04.500]   that our homeschooling is done necessarily for most of us.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.420]   Did you usually have some things that you did want
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.740]   to finish up after foundations and essentials were done
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.060]   or even with challenge with older students,
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.860]   were there things at the end that you thought,
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.060]   well, now we might have time to really do justice to this?
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.700]   Or to look at it again?
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.820]   - Yes, oh yes.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:31.540]   There was always something that I recognized
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.660]   during the weeks of the program,
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.220]   either foundations, essentials or a challenge
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.940]   that it would peak my attention.
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.260]   We need to either revisit this
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.500]   because we didn't quite get it,
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.260]   or pique their interest.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.820]   Something they've really wanted to talk about
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.660]   like a history sentence.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.980]   I know my boys love building pyramids.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.740]   We had Legos and just things that,
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.500]   just ask the Lord to bring to mind those moments
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.420]   like science experiments that maybe they just love doing
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.300]   or art, something they did in community
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.900]   that you recognized brought some excitement or attention.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.140]   And then also we do have,
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.700]   there are places at the end of the year that you go,
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.940]   we really need to work on more on spelling.
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.540]   - Right.
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.420]   - And so I think balancing both those things,
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.100]   incorporating, going back through and pulling those,
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.500]   especially those experiments and art projects
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.100]   that they really love doing.
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.980]   That egg drop thing is so cool.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.140]   - Oh my gosh, yes.
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.300]   - And do it at home.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.660]   You know, there's nothing wrong with doing something twice
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.900]   or three times. - Oh my gosh.
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:53.740]   - Kids are much, yes, they are much less easily bored
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.180]   than we think they are.
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.020]   - Yes.
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.340]   - You know, I have discovered with my grandson
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.980]   who's not quite two yet, he delights.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.940]   I will sing him a silly little song,
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.340]   sometimes a song that I made up or read him a book.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:11.620]   And 90% of the time what he does is look at me and say,
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:15.580]   "Lolly, again, again."
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.020]   I mean, they love to do things again.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.340]   And the beauty of doing things like the egg drop
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.580]   is that every time you do it,
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:26.380]   you get a little bit of a different result.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.620]   And they are amazed and amused
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.420]   to see how differently things can go.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.980]   - Yeah, and it's a great way to incorporate.
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.300]   You know, we always got a little lonely.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.700]   That was the thing that my children miss the most.
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.540]   - Yep.
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.300]   - And so we just would gather friends, you know,
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.020]   and in a very informal settings,
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.940]   we didn't have to make a big deal.
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.900]   And we'd do something like,
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.700]   let's have a, you know, kind of a sinner day
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.940]   where you just rotated through different things
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.460]   and hey, make a bridge out of straws
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.380]   or paint an upside down painting.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:11.340]   And especially if you were with other foundations families,
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.940]   they knew exactly what you were up to.
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:14.780]   - Yeah.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.340]   - And it was a lot of fun.
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.060]   So, yeah, I think just recognizing
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.340]   and the delights that they had
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.820]   and allowing them time to explore that more.
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.340]   And especially as you're challenged students,
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.620]   sometimes they're just so tired, Lisa,
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:33.820]   you know, two bucks
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.900]   and they don't wanna think about another thing.
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.900]   But that's when you can hone,
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.540]   I know their own interest.
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.700]   We had students, a couple of friends,
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.140]   they were really into drama.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.900]   Now, I am not a drama person.
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.020]   (laughing)
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.420]   We were like, okay, you come up with an idea
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.580]   and we will make this happen for you.
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.500]   And so she came up with like this workshop day
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:04.380]   where everybody, moms, including all the kids were involved
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.340]   and we helped her find a location, we brought snacks.
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.580]   We spent the whole day doing these drama exercises.
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.060]   (laughing)
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:13.900]   - Okay.
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.460]   - You know, it was so fun.
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.420]   We did "Panamime" and that was hilarious.
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.380]   And then she just divided us into groups
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.700]   where we read scripts of different plays
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.660]   and we performed it in the evening together.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.500]   - Oh my goodness, how fun.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.820]   - And that was so fun.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.260]   It was something that she was passionate about,
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.420]   not the rest of us.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.620]   I have three sons that were rolling their eyes,
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.740]   but you know, by the end of the day,
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.340]   they had a great time.
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.060]   It was great exposure.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.620]   It wasn't something that was quote in the transcript,
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.700]   so to speak, but it combined a lot of things.
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:54.100]   We read Shakespeare, we were exposed to other artists
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.300]   and we are other venues.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.380]   So it's just the idea.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.180]   And even we've given our older students
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.220]   some opportunities to make plans.
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.020]   Like we had a scripture memory, little mini conference.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.980]   We were like, all right, girls, get to it.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.460]   You tell us what you need, but you're going to put it on.
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.260]   And so for challenge kids,
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.820]   just giving them opportunity to gather
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.100]   and do things that they find really interesting.
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.300]   If, whether it's, you know, attending something
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.740]   or coming up with your own idea
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.580]   and hosting it, doing it.
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.020]   And I think for moms, instead of me going,
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.860]   I am so tired, I don't want to do another thing,
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.740]   to really say, hey, I think communicating,
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.060]   I am on board with this.
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.140]   I'm all over it.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.660]   You just tell me what you need.
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.700]   And I think that is, you know, our kids really love us.
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.620]   They don't want to put more burdens on us either.
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.980]   But I think having the attitude of,
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.780]   we can make that happen.
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:00.780]   And I think that energy is kind of sends them on their way
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.820]   and you start drawing people in
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:07.540]   that maybe you haven't spent time with before,
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.860]   but friendship that just butted in that,
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.060]   or you got to see your mom
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.980]   do something outrageously ridiculous.
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.380]   (all laughing)
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.220]   - Yeah, my girls always loved that,
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.980]   seeing mom do outrageously ridiculous things.
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:21.820]   - Yes.
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.940]   - But you know what, I was sitting here thinking
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.900]   as you were talking about that,
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:30.740]   those are huge opportunities for our teenagers
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:35.660]   to learn life skills of planning and inviting
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:40.140]   and hosting and strategizing and advertising
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.140]   and setting a schedule and managing resources
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.420]   in a really low key way.
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.620]   But that is what they're doing.
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.500]   Those are the skills that they're learning.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.460]   And if you said, I want to give you a mini course
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.580]   on how to be a productive worker or a great manager,
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:03.660]   that would sound like a terrible thing to them.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.660]   But if you put it in the guise of creating something
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.060]   that they are eager to participate in,
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.700]   they're usually all in.
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.300]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.700]   It was some of those were probably the most memorable
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.620]   because the kids were so invested in it.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:26.780]   And also just reckoning with when things don't go
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.260]   exactly like the plan.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.980]   I mean, that's a really good life.
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.820]   We had some great-
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.220]   - Great life lesson.
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:37.580]   - Yep, so I think for the challenge students,
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:41.540]   listening for some of their passions,
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.780]   but also are there opportunities
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.500]   like as you look forward to their next year,
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.580]   are there ways that you can sort of gently,
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.820]   like, is there a play, for example?
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:56.860]   If you're doing Shakespeare, is there a Shakespeare play?
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.700]   Usually there is somewhere in the summer.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.780]   Attend one, just to kind of give them
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.140]   a general kind of intro,
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.340]   or like, especially for government,
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.420]   one of the things, go to a city council meeting,
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.780]   go to a board meeting over the summer.
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.300]   They welcome students generally.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.300]   And it's a great way to just gently introduce government,
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.420]   how government, and you're just providing opportunities
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.980]   for conversations.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:27.460]   And so I would say, yeah, I'll keep,
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.380]   you have that list of field trips that you think,
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.940]   oh, we never got to that, or go do it again.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.620]   I mean, you know, go see some other,
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.740]   go watch like, okay, we're going,
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.140]   we used to have an, we have an aquarium here.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.020]   It's huge, it takes too long to go through in one day.
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.340]   So we would just say,
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.140]   we're only gonna go to this exhibit.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:49.980]   - Uh-huh, uh-huh.
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.140]   - And that's what we're gonna spend an hour,
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.060]   and we're gonna leave.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:53.900]   We're not gonna get over it.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.140]   - Right, you don't get too much of a good thing.
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.460]   - Yeah, which just ends up being too much, yeah.
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.020]   Absolutely, I like that.
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.900]   I liked it that you also earlier talked about,
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:11.780]   there really might be work,
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.660]   work that you found left over
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.420]   when community ended for the year.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.780]   I know there were times, you know, if the family gets sick,
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.820]   sometimes somebody, everybody in the family will get sick,
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.340]   but they don't do it all in the same week.
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.340]   So I had, there were times when it's like,
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.380]   somebody is sick in the family every week for three weeks.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.220]   - Yes.
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:37.220]   - You know, you, maybe you miss a whole IEW,
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.820]   you miss a whole writing section.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.780]   Or for the challenge kids, it really,
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.100]   if you are sick for a week in challenge,
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.940]   it's like missing a week of college.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:51.260]   You have missed an entire book or an entire paper.
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.460]   And so you might look back
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.700]   when you get to the end of community days and think,
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.020]   "Oh yeah, that's the book we didn't read."
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:05.420]   So let me say to you, if you really think,
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.900]   and I really wanted my student to read that book
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.420]   because I wanted us to talk about these, those ideas,
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.580]   or I wanted to shape their moral imagination
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.620]   by letting them wrestle with this thing
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.380]   that will probably never happen to them,
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.180]   but I'd like for them to think about it.
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.780]   So you could read the book,
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.260]   you could do it as a read aloud,
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.540]   or you could go find a movie adaptation of it.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.900]   Or like you said, Amy, a play of it.
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.220]   Just because you missed something
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.300]   during the community year,
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.540]   doesn't mean you have to miss it forever.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:46.060]   You can pick it up and do it on your own.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.460]   If you missed that science experiment
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.860]   that they were looking forward to,
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.260]   you know, how terrible to miss the egg drop
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.220]   off the building day.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.060]   You can always, you don't have to wait
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.140]   until that cycle comes back to foundations.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:00.980]   Do it yourself.
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.540]   If you missed one of the art projects,
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.060]   oh, my children hated to miss the art projects.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:11.620]   So do it at home, or like you said, do it again.
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.820]   There sometimes is work left over
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:19.820]   that you can do or do in a fun or funny way.
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.700]   And still get some of the benefit from.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.620]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.580]   And sometimes, Lisa,
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:31.580]   you probably have some kind of expert in your backyard
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.980]   that would love to talk about chemistry
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.300]   or would love, we had two older gentlemen
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.540]   in our neighborhood that were veterans of the Korean War.
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:46.180]   So just to go take some cookies
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.860]   and use the afternoon of just talking to them,
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.620]   interviewing, yeah, look around.
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.580]   Sometimes if you've missed a part,
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:59.540]   like a book, maybe a, you know, like "The Scarlet Letter,"
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.740]   there's usually someone around that,
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.300]   ask the Lord, someone that will be around
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.540]   that you can say, "Hey, can we do a day
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.660]   where we just do kind of an intensive
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.380]   about this particular book or writing
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.100]   or this particular history event?"
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.220]   It doesn't have to be a big deal.
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.340]   Gather people more than likely.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.500]   Again, we can, if you've done it once,
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.220]   nobody knows everything about the Korean War.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.700]   - Right, exactly.
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.980]   - Gather your friends.
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.380]   Usually moms are just as desperate as you are.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.540]   And have someone come in and talk, you know,
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.500]   host someone that's an expert
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.100]   that might show you something about that part of history
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.500]   that you didn't know.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.300]   I found that it's pretty,
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:49.060]   people are eager to share what they're passionate about.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.540]   - People like telling their own story.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.340]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.620]   So it's not, or do something,
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.060]   I know, crazy, like meet at the park.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:04.060]   We had, we didn't get to finish up our dissections.
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.780]   That was a great story.
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:06.900]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.980]   - One of our local, the supervision of the Lord,
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.340]   a woman that we know well,
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.700]   she had her degree in biology.
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.420]   She had a strong creationist background.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.180]   And so she was so eager.
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.660]   I'm like, "If we get the pigs, will you help us?"
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:25.460]   And we all gathered around in a pavilion.
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.820]   I mean, it was kind of an odd place to do dissections.
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.540]   - Well, you know, you were--
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:30.380]   - And it worked.
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.220]   - Absolutely.
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.100]   - And I just loved it.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.420]   And she was so,
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.620]   she was so good at explaining things
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.980]   and just acknowledging the wonder of God.
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.460]   And that was a complete gift from the Lord.
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:47.340]   And so you just, I think we,
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.860]   I think for me, I just don't anticipate.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:55.020]   I get very tunnel visioned
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:00.020]   instead of just recognizing what God has provided
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:03.340]   and using those opportunities
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:08.340]   to really kind of showcase his design and his creation.
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.380]   He's eager to show us.
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.260]   I mean, he does it all the time, every day.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.820]   So giving me an imagination that I can go,
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.300]   "Hey, I need to call so-and-so.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:22.300]   "I bet they can come over and tell us about Japan."
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.700]   - See, that is so good.
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.900]   We get so busy thinking that we,
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.820]   as the homeschooling parent, have to provide all of this.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.460]   And frankly, by the end of the year,
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:36.420]   you might be tired of producing the circus every week.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.460]   And so we just sit back and think,
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.940]   "Yeah, I should be doing something.
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.540]   "I don't know what it is I should be doing.
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.020]   "And I don't have the energy to do it."
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.580]   So your ideas are awesome, Amy.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:51.020]   Sit and ask the Lord who in my community
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:56.020]   would be blessed by having something to do.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.780]   A lot of times, like you said,
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.380]   those people are itching to share their passion
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.620]   or their story with somebody else.
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:06.980]   What is it that you think,
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.540]   you mentioned one thing that I suspect most of us miss a lot
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.900]   when community days are over.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.700]   What is it that families miss the most
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.980]   when CC is done until the fall?
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.580]   - Oh, it's their friends.
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.460]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:27.580]   - I wish I could say it was literature, but it is not.
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.820]   - Right, right.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.060]   - It's their friends.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.100]   - You know, sometimes I discovered
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.980]   that my girls missed talking about
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.580]   and wrestling with that with their friends.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.820]   They enjoyed being with their friends,
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.140]   but actually they didn't mind talking about literature
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:49.140]   or science or government or art
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:53.580]   if they just had somebody to talk to that was like them,
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.940]   you know, not their mom and dad necessarily.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:56.860]   - Yes, yes.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.580]   - Yeah, I do think they miss their friends.
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.500]   I do think some of our children,
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.580]   especially our young children,
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.740]   I do think they miss routine.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:08.580]   - Yes, yes.
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:13.460]   - You know, I think routine is really important
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.380]   for little children.
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.340]   It's comforting to them
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.540]   and it gives them a rhythm to their day
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.380]   and they can kind of know what to expect.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.020]   And community day was something they knew what to expect.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.580]   You know, when we would be together,
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.020]   when I'll be with my class,
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.500]   when we will do our memory work,
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.980]   when we will do a presentation,
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.500]   when we will have our snack.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.100]   And so just as parents,
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:44.100]   if we can be sensitive to what our children are missing
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.820]   and try not necessarily to replicate it,
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.340]   but try to provide some of that.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:55.020]   So especially in those first weeks when community is over,
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:00.020]   maybe you guys do still get up sort of at the same time
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.260]   and you do have lunch together
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.220]   and you do some reading time together
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.060]   and maybe some activity time together
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:12.180]   instead of everybody just doing whatever by themselves.
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.820]   - Yeah, I didn't find that.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.740]   I mean, that worked for like the first hour of spring.
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.580]   - Yes, yes.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.940]   - And then we're all at each other's throats, you know,
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.940]   because we're bored or tired or lonely or confused.
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:28.940]   And yeah, we usually kept kind of a family rhythm,
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.780]   you know, chores, breakfast, devotions.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.660]   And then usually at devotions,
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.900]   and we do this through the school year,
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.580]   but we kept it going in the summer.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.740]   Like, okay, what's the goal for the day?
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.540]   What do we want to know?
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.500]   And it helped.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.980]   Some of my children are very scheduling people
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.100]   and others were not.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:54.100]   It did reassure them that we're not just, you know,
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.580]   floundering around,
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.780]   that here are some things
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.620]   that we're gonna try to do this week
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.980]   or these friends are coming over
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:06.140]   or we've got to go here today, whatever.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.540]   I think it just reassures everyone
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.820]   that it's not up to them
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.740]   to create their own reality in a sense.
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.380]   And also recognizing our children
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.380]   and probably everyone's has probably a volunteer opportunity
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:25.820]   they want to be a part of or vacation Bible school
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.180]   or the summer reading program.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:32.780]   There's usually things that you kind of sign people up for
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.460]   and just coordinating those things.
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.020]   Remember, we're gonna go do this.
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.740]   And I think that helped some of mine to be reassured
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.900]   that things aren't just pounced on them.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.460]   - Yes, yes.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.300]   - And that we actually had something to look forward to
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:51.380]   and that they, of course, were part of that planning.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.140]   You know, it wasn't something enforced.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.060]   Usually it was something, hey, I'd like to do this
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.900]   and this is how we can get this done.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:03.260]   So I do, I'm a rhythm person.
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.140]   So it helped me.
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.260]   And especially starting the day again,
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.220]   I think I was trying to be careful
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:13.540]   not to ditch our daily devotions
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.780]   because it was kind of like,
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.540]   so we would do something different.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.340]   We'd read like a mission story.
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.420]   You know, we try to change,
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.940]   even change that up a little bit
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.140]   where we'd read a biography
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.580]   and there are plenty of those great biographies
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.860]   and talk about that.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.180]   So just to, just,
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.300]   and I think that touching base first thing in the morning
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.620]   as a family is always helpful.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:41.620]   We don't splinter off into the world.
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:42.460]   - Right, right.
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.580]   - Yeah, being a rhythm is a great idea.
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.900]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.940]   I think I have a lot.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:54.180]   I, in my years talking to young families,
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:56.340]   especially at practicum season,
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.220]   young families, young moms and dads
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.100]   who are worrying that they haven't done enough
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.100]   to quit for the year.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:09.180]   You know, there's just something about our culture now,
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:12.420]   Amy, is way more run, run, run
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.020]   and schedule, schedule, schedule
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:17.700]   and plan everything to the nth degree.
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.220]   And there is,
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:24.540]   there's almost a sense of shame
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.860]   about resting.
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.980]   And I want to combat that with every ounce of my being.
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:35.300]   Moms and dads, listen,
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.700]   it is okay to rest.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.500]   It is okay to use the time
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.900]   between the end of community
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.180]   and the beginning of full-on summer
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.700]   to take a restful break,
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.660]   to take a deep breath.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:56.660]   You know, I wanted to brainstorm with you, Amy,
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:01.660]   some things that say rest without guilt to a mama heart.
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:06.340]   I mean, what are some restful yet meaningful activities
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.180]   for family learning time?
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.460]   You've shared a bunch already.
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:15.060]   You know, reading, keeping the daily devotion time,
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.380]   but maybe expanding it.
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.500]   You mentioned reading mission biographies.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.020]   Find a devotional book.
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.740]   I know, and I probably have mentioned it before,
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:30.300]   my children loved the book,
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.740]   Heinz Feet on High Places.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.700]   And they would beg for extra chapters of that.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:40.540]   And we read Little Pilgrim's Progress,
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.660]   a children's version of Pilgrim's Progress.
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:48.940]   So we read some things that were fiction,
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.060]   that were maybe allegories.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.700]   We read some things like that
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.220]   as part of our devotion time as time.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.060]   And that was restful.
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.340]   It had a rhythm.
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.380]   They knew we were gonna do it every day,
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:06.380]   but we didn't have to be sitting up in our chairs to do it.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.500]   What are some other restful but meaningful activities
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.620]   that we can give our listeners?
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.020]   - Well, I think those are great ideas.
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.060]   Yeah, Lisa, I think, first of all,
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.860]   it really reassures me that God says,
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.500]   be still and know that I'm God.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:26.500]   And I think part of it is setting your mind at rest,
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:31.140]   being reassured that God is working.
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.300]   I'd love that.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.900]   I used to think, we'd ask,
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.380]   I'd ask, "Lord, what do you want me to do?"
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.940]   And I call it my RPI verse,
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.620]   rejoice always, pray without ceasing,
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.060]   and in everything give thanks.
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:47.860]   That's the will of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:49.420]   And that's Thessalonians.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.140]   And that just centered me.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.580]   Like, okay, so can I do those things?
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.420]   Yes.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:38:00.420]   And so as I moved into like an activity
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.940]   to bring that along with me,
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:07.780]   that restful, peaceful spirit,
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.140]   not the frantic,
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.740]   we've got to justify our existence through busyness.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:16.340]   And that to know and ask the Lord,
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.340]   "Okay, Lord, how can you guide us today?"
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.900]   And I think part of it is, you know, go outside.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:26.300]   Take, be together as a family.
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.420]   Plan something that you're all together
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.500]   in one space at one time.
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.060]   And that's why sometimes just getting away
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.660]   from the house and chores,
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.980]   whether it's a walk or a park,
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:43.900]   you know, go and just be restful outside,
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.260]   explore the natural world.
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.980]   That's very restful.
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.580]   And taking a hike and taking a pair of binoculars
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.540]   and your field guide,
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.260]   and just saying, you know, some lunch,
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:56.580]   and just going and saying,
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.020]   "Today, this is what we're going to do."
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:03.620]   I think signaling to your children that rest
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:07.020]   and changing rhythm into rest,
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.100]   a Sabbath, so to speak,
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.860]   during the day is such a,
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:16.660]   that is a lifetime lesson.
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.420]   I wish I had learned that.
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.740]   And now, you know, instead of inflicting,
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.180]   like you said, this burden on ourselves.
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.060]   So I think modeling that,
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:29.020]   but that means you really have to release
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:33.140]   your sense of, well, I'm not, you know,
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.820]   I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:38.140]   Like, really release that and trust God with it.
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.260]   I do think that those kinds of conversations,
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.740]   having conversations,
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:46.340]   allowing space to have a lengthy conversation
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.620]   around the table, you know,
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.500]   have everyone bring their favorite quote to the table.
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.900]   Like, what did you read this year that you love?
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.860]   Let's talk about it and really linger there
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.300]   instead of, oh dear, you know,
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.100]   end of that time, we've got to go do something.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.220]   - Right, right.
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.540]   - So just allowing for that to happen
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:06.220]   and don't be disappointed if it doesn't.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.420]   You know, frequently we shoot at things
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:10.620]   and we give it a shot and we think,
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:11.740]   well, it just didn't work.
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.860]   Well, sometimes those kinds of things
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.580]   may take a little while, you know,
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.300]   for people to feel comfortable and know what to expect.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:22.780]   And I think just having, giving space and time
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.500]   and communicating that we have the space and time.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.300]   I think that's really important.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.700]   But you know, there's things that you can add
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:32.940]   that are restful.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.940]   We had, let's see, moms that we not,
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.740]   and I didn't, I just coordinated it.
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.300]   I did not participate in it.
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.740]   Moms that were really good at cooking things.
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.940]   - Uh-huh, uh-huh.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.940]   - So we did, we went to their house
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.220]   and they showed us how to make pie crust.
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.700]   And then another one showed us
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.100]   how to make their favorite, you know, meringue,
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.300]   which is so much fun.
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.220]   But, you know, it was restful.
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.860]   It was, and it was like,
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.340]   this is the way we get to know this godly person,
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:06.900]   this, we are learning a skill, but we're together,
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:11.460]   you know, and I think it's just mainly that,
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.660]   that for me is trusting that God
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.860]   just has a much bigger curriculum for us.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.540]   - Yes, I love that.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.740]   I love that when the year has ended
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:26.380]   and we're done with our curriculum,
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:30.340]   realizing that God has a much bigger curriculum,
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.620]   that He wants us to learn about His Word
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:35.180]   and about His world.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.220]   And that really, it's so exciting to me to think,
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.740]   oh my gosh, this is a space of time
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:46.540]   when we can enjoy and appreciate all of this
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.820]   in relationship to one another.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:54.580]   And how much we grow when we share experiences
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.500]   and how much we learn about each other
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.100]   when we slow down
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:05.100]   and do something new or something old together
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.580]   and talk about it.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.740]   Why did you like it?
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.420]   Why don't, why do you not like it?
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.180]   Why did yours turn out well?
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.420]   And why did mine not turn out well?
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.980]   And why are you feeling sad today?
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.540]   And why are you so jittery?
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.500]   Or why are you so happy?
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:25.500]   Just making time and space to be together
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:31.460]   and to do life together is very refreshing.
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.660]   And I have to say, Amy,
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.060]   I just, I have to bring this up
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.500]   'cause you and I are together.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.780]   I really, really honestly think
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.220]   that the Scribblers activities are perfect
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.780]   for this time of year.
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.900]   Even if you don't have a four to eight year old
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.060]   or only four to eight year olds,
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:52.820]   those Scribblers activities are so much fun
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.420]   and they open avenues of conversation
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.380]   in so many directions.
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:00.540]   - Yes, yes.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:01.500]   I was gonna say that.
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.980]   That is just got so much in there.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:08.740]   And the nice thing about it is that it does span.
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:11.300]   You know, you can have a challenge student
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.460]   sitting at your table
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:16.300]   and there's a team policy goofy serial debate
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:17.540]   that you can have.
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.620]   Yeah, and that's a great way
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:25.020]   to help all of your children be connected too.
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:25.860]   That you can go,
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:28.340]   "Okay, well, one day you're gonna do team policy."
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.860]   You know, and it's just a,
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.420]   yeah, Scribblers was such a,
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.500]   what a great vision
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.820]   because it does incorporate your youngest learner
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.980]   with you as the adult
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.500]   and then everyone in between.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:46.700]   And yeah, they're kind of really easy to,
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.140]   restful, I would say.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.460]   - Yeah, I think they are restful.
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.060]   - Restful activities.
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.340]   - And the cool thing is
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:56.500]   because those activities are about building skills
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.380]   and not producing a certain outcome
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.540]   or project or artifact.
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.340]   I mean, sometimes you do,
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.100]   but there's not a prescribed one.
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.580]   And so because they're all about building skills,
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:10.940]   everybody participates wherever they are.
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:14.020]   - If your skill looks different than your brother's skill
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.860]   and different than your sister's skill
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.340]   and different than your dad's skill,
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:21.020]   we are all still doing the same activity
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:25.540]   and getting results that are expanding our own skills.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:29.060]   - Yeah, it's really like a one-room schoolhouse again.
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:31.860]   You know, it's everyone around the table and everyone.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.180]   And that's what's nice.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.180]   You don't have to be the center
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:37.460]   of coordinating the information.
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.300]   - Yes, I love it.
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.300]   I love it.
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.060]   - The information can come from your challenge to student.
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.060]   Like they can finish this and they're like,
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.060]   "Well, I just wrote a blue book about this."
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.900]   - I can talk about that.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.980]   I love it.
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:50.820]   And you know what?
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.020]   The best thing that you said is that
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.980]   it's like the one-room schoolhouse again.
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:58.540]   So families, community day is over.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:01.500]   Now, everybody in your house
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.540]   can do the same thing together.
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:08.420]   You can have the one-room schoolhouse experience
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.900]   in these after community is done,
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.420]   before the summer starts.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:16.140]   You can really learn together
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.180]   and have conversations together
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.100]   and everybody can be part of it.
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.340]   And this might turn out to be
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.860]   your favorite part of the year.
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:25.700]   Who knows?
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:30.260]   Amy, thank you so much for sharing your work
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.620]   and good ideas and experiences.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:34.500]   I appreciate that.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:38.460]   And listeners, I hope that you have been encouraged.
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:42.420]   I know you have gotten some good practical ideas from Amy,
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.300]   but I hope you have been encouraged
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.820]   and that maybe really and truly,
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:51.140]   this will become one of your favorite times of year.
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:55.500]   As you have time to rest and reflect
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:00.060]   and look around maybe for things to do in the summer
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.180]   as summer approaches,
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:07.180]   I want to remind you that Classical Conversations
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.700]   is always trying to build relationships
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.260]   with like-minded organizations.
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:15.940]   Organizations that will really help you to homeschool
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.580]   and further the mission to know God and make Him known.
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:23.020]   And a lot of these organizations that we partner with
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.540]   offer discounts or benefits,
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.540]   sometimes even scholarships
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.660]   to Classical Conversations families.
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:33.740]   So as you're thinking about things to do this summer
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.940]   or things for your students to participate in
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:39.300]   in the year or years to come,
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:44.300]   you might want to check out our relationships page.

[00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:59.500]   that we are partnering with.

[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.780]   advancement services,
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:10.580]   extracurricular support and family culture organizations,
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:13.220]   Christian colleges and universities,
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:17.380]   and even some mission and gap year opportunities.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:22.380]   So that's classicalconversations.com/relationships/.
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:27.020]   Check it out.
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:30.340]   I think you'll find something that you'll like there.
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:32.500]   Listeners again, thank you so much.
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.540]   And I will look forward to seeing you next week.
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:36.380]   Bye-bye.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.960]   (gentle music)
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:41.020]   you
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.080]   you
