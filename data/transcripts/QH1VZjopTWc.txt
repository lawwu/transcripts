[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040]   Next on the list is Bank of America.
[00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.700]   Bank of America's lineup is pretty interesting
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.480]   and it was incredibly interesting before the launch
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.760]   of the US Bank Smartly card and the Robinhood card.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.180]   And I'll say for a couple reasons,
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.600]   it's maybe still interesting.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.520]   And if you look at any Bank of America card on face value,
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.060]   it's probably not gonna be that exciting.
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.360]   And it becomes exciting with their preferred rewards program.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.300]   They have a gold tier, a platinum tier,
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.640]   a platinum honors tier, and a diamond tier.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.160]   And the reason that gets interesting
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.940]   is because whatever you earn on your credit card
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.680]   gets multiplied based on the tier you have.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.600]   And so if you have $20,000 of combined balance
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.660]   across your accounts at Bank of America,
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.280]   which includes any accounts you have at Merrill,
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.880]   their partner brokerage firm,
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.320]   you get a increase of 25% of the points.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.120]   If you have over $50,000,
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.280]   then you qualify for the platinum tier
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.720]   and you get a 50% boost.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.720]   And then at platinum honors, you get a 75% boost.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.800]   And then at the diamond tier,
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.480]   you actually get no extra benefits on your credit card.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.940]   So I don't know why that tier
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.300]   would be interesting to anyone.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.300]   I've never heard of anyone in the points world talk about it.
