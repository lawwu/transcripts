[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   [silence]
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.120]   Hangover is a constellation of effects
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.200]   ranging from headache to nausea
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.580]   to what's sometimes called anxiety,
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.860]   which is anxiety that follows a day of drinking.
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.280]   Anxiety, I think we can understand physiologically
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.940]   if we think about that process of alcohol intake
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.980]   increasing the amount of cortisol
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.600]   and the ratio of cortisol to some other stress hormones.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.260]   That well explains why some people wake up the day after
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.800]   or even the day after a night drinking
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.480]   and feel anxious and not well and stressed
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.280]   for reasons they don't understand.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.320]   So if you're somebody who experiences anxiety,
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.520]   then again, I refer you to the master stress episode
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.400]   that we put out some time ago
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.360]   and you can find that hubermanlab.com.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.520]   Tools to deal with anxiety, tools to deal with stress
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.920]   ranging again from behavioral
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.920]   to nutritional supplement-based, et cetera.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.840]   That of course is not justification for going out
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.720]   and drinking so much
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.080]   that you get anxiety-induced hangover.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.000]   But for those of you that are experiencing
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.440]   post-alcohol consumption anxiety, as it were,
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.860]   that could be a useful resource
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.440]   because I certainly don't want anyone
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.200]   experiencing uncomfortable amounts of anxiety
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.600]   and there are great tools and resources for that.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.160]   Now, the other aspects of hangover,
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.400]   such as the stomachache or headache
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.200]   or feelings of malaise or fogginess,
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.840]   those can be related to a number of different things
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.200]   and probably are related to a number of different things.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.080]   First of all, the sleep that one gets after even just one,
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.000]   yes, even just one glass of wine or a beer
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.740]   is not the same sleep that you get
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.320]   when you don't have alcohol circulating in your system.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.680]   And not trying to be a downer here,
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.720]   but this was discussed in the Huberman Lab podcast episode
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.160]   where I had Dr. Matthew Walker from UC Berkeley on,
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.880]   and of course, Dr. Walker is a world expert in sleep,
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.600]   runs one of the preeminent laboratories
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.560]   studying sleep and its effects,
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.600]   wrote the incredible book "Why We Sleep" and so on.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.320]   Dr. Walker told me, and it certainly is supported
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.360]   by lots and lots of quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.080]   in animals and in humans,
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.480]   that when alcohol is present in the brain and bloodstream,
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.320]   that the architecture of sleep is disrupted.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.200]   Slow-wave sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.120]   all of which are essential
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.320]   for getting a restorative night's sleep are all disrupted.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.760]   So for those of you that are drinking a glass or two of wine
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.760]   or having a hard liquor drink or a beer
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.440]   in order to fall asleep,
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.960]   the sleep you're getting is simply not high-quality sleep,
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.960]   or certainly not as high quality as the sleep you'd be
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.000]   getting if you did not have alcohol in your system.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.820]   Of course, when we're talking about hangover,
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.160]   we're talking generally about the consumption
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.600]   of more than just one or two drinks.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.360]   Of course, for some people, one or two drinks
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.260]   is probably sufficient to induce hangover,
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.960]   but for most people, it's going to be having three or four,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.640]   exceeding their typical limit, as it's called.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.760]   Again, not the legal limit, that's a whole other business.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.240]   But when one ingests too much alcohol for them,
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.360]   one of the reasons they feel terrible the next day
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.400]   is because their sleep isn't really good sleep.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.920]   In fact, it's not even sleep,
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.880]   it's often considered pseudo-sleep,
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.800]   or at least that's what it's called
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.120]   in the sleep science field,
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.080]   because people are in kind of a low-level hypnotic
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.600]   kind of trance, it's not real sleep,
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.000]   they're multiple bouts of waking up,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.920]   they may not even realize they're waking up multiple times.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.680]   Okay, so there's the sleep-induced effects.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.920]   Then there are the disrupted gut microbiome effects,
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.200]   some of which we talked about earlier,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.040]   so now you understand the mechanism
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.600]   of alcohol destroying good, healthy gut microbiota,
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.320]   which then leads to leaky gut and things of that sort.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.040]   But one could imagine, again, could imagine,
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.800]   and there is some evidence starting to support this,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.560]   that, again, ingesting low-sugar fermented foods
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.360]   or maybe in prebiotic or probiotic
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.800]   to support the gut microbiome
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.640]   might assist in some of the gut-related malaise
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.240]   associated with hangover.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.480]   In other words, get those gut microbiota healthy again
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.400]   as quickly as possible,
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.120]   or maybe even before you drink,
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.400]   have those gut microbiota healthy.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.240]   I would hope that you would do that.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.600]   I think everybody should be doing something
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.980]   to support their gut microbiome,
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.020]   whether or not it's the ingestion
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.840]   of low-sugar fermented foods daily
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.600]   or at least on a regular basis,
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.000]   or ingestion of probiotic or prebiotic.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.520]   The gut microbiome is so important
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.160]   for so many different things.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.040]   In terms of hangover and headache,
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.080]   we know that that's caused by vasoconstriction,
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.560]   the constriction of blood vessels
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.960]   that tends to occur as a rebound after a night of drinking.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.840]   Alcohol can act as a vasodilator.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.120]   It can dilate the blood vessels.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.360]   Part of that is associated with the increase
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.380]   in so-called parasympathetic tone.
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.840]   We have an autonomic nervous system.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.980]   It's got a sympathetic component.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.240]   These are neurons that make us more alert.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.600]   And if they're very active, they make us very stressed.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.700]   There's also the parasympathetic aspect
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.720]   of the autonomic nervous system.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.220]   This is all just fancy geek speak
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.000]   for the parts of your brain and body,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.640]   the nerve cells that make you very relaxed.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.760]   When you're very relaxed, there tends to be vasodilation.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.080]   It allows for more movement of blood
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.480]   and other things through the bloodstream.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.720]   And alcohol tends to induce some vasodilation,
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.400]   at least in some of the capillary beds.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.400]   And then when the alcohol wears off,
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.160]   there's a vasoconstriction and people get brutal headaches.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.000]   That's why some people will take aspirin or Tylenol
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.500]   or Advil or things like that,
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.920]   the sort of non-steroid anti-inflammatories.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.640]   I should mention, there's a lot of literature coming out
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.360]   that some of these non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.560]   are not good for us for a number of different reasons.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.400]   The way they impact the liver,
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.360]   the way they impact the immune system,
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.920]   and no surprise, the way they impact the gut microbiome.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.480]   So I'm not one to tell you what medications
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.420]   to take or not take,
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.820]   but you certainly would want to do a quick web search
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.820]   of effects of non-steroid anti-inflammatories and aspirin
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.000]   before you start taking those
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.700]   or stop taking those for that matter.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.200]   Generally, they will alleviate headache,
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.960]   but they can often have other issues,
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.880]   including liver issues.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.880]   And keep in mind the night after drinking,
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.040]   your liver has already taken a beating
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.600]   because of the need of the liver to convert alcohol
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.880]   from acetaldehyde into acetate,
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.080]   which is now a pathway that you well understand.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.720]   So I'm not certain.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.620]   And in fact, I believe it's not the greatest idea
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.560]   to burden your liver further through the use of things
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.040]   that are going to cause it to have to work harder
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.080]   and metabolize things
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.740]   if the goal is simply to alleviate a headache.
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.000]   There's a lot of kind of lore, old school lore
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.120]   about how to relieve a hangover.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.120]   We already talked about how eating food won't do that,
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.680]   but eating food will prevent the rapid absorption
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.960]   of even more alcohol into the bloodstream.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.720]   There's the lore that one should simply ingest more alcohol.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.320]   What terrible advice that is.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.520]   That's just going to delay an even worse hangover.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.280]   However, I'd be remiss if I didn't say
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.480]   that the reason that that myth came to be,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.440]   or that I should say that truth came to be,
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.200]   because indeed ingesting more alcohol
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.720]   will alleviate a hangover,
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.800]   but then a worse hangover will show up.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.640]   The reason that came to be
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.440]   is because ingestion of more alcohol
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.840]   will cause those constricted vessels
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.080]   that are giving the headache to dilate again.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.720]   But of course, ingesting more alcohol
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.040]   to relieve a hangover is simply a bad idea.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.880]   Just don't do it.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.760]   I think this is called the hair of the dog approach.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.320]   Maybe someone can put in the show note captions on YouTube
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.120]   why it's called the hair of the dog.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.400]   I can come up with a few ideas,
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.480]   but they're not going to be very good ones.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.020]   And some of them would probably even be outright ridiculous.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.000]   So do not ingest more alcohol
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.640]   simply to try and recover from a hangover.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.800]   I know many people have tried that one before,
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.600]   but that's a terrible idea.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.140]   Now, one thing that you'll also hear out there
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.240]   is that deliberate cold exposure,
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.260]   for instance, taking a cold shower might relieve hangover.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.800]   I find this one particularly interesting
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.160]   because we've done episodes
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.920]   on the benefits of deliberate cold exposure.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.880]   We have an entire episode about that.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.440]   You can find it again, hubermanlab.com.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.120]   There are direct links to some of the tools
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.920]   related to deliberate cold exposure.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.760]   And we have an entire newsletter
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.520]   on deliberate cold exposure protocols
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.880]   you can find on hubermanlab.com,
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.760]   go to our neural network newsletter.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.720]   So those of you that are interested in ice baths
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.200]   and cold showers and ways to leverage those,
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.500]   you can find that there.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.240]   What you won't find there is a description
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.680]   of how to use deliberate cold exposure
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.160]   for sake of treating hangover.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.480]   But here I went into the literature
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.140]   and I found something kind of interesting.
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.960]   There is some evidence that increasing levels
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.040]   of epinephrine in the bloodstream
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.760]   can actually help with alcohol clearance.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.980]   That was very surprising to me.
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.820]   And I want to point out
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.080]   this is not a large and robust literature,
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.960]   but there's some evidence pointing to the fact
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   that when levels of epinephrine adrenaline
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.000]   are raised in the brain and bloodstream,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.200]   that some of the components of alcohol metabolism
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.240]   can be accelerated
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.040]   and some of the inebriating effects of alcohol
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:44.880]   can be reduced.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.400]   So maybe this old school lore of taking a cold shower
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.720]   actually has something to it.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.080]   So in thinking about the use of deliberate cold exposure
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.620]   in order to reduce the effects of hangover
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.120]   or to more rapidly clear alcohol
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.800]   from the brain and bloodstream,
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.160]   I want to be very clear
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.740]   and I want to emphasize your safety.
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.460]   The way to do that is to understand
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.880]   that alcohol lowers core body temperature, okay?
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.600]   It can make people slightly hypothermic.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.020]   It's going to drop core body temperature.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.500]   So if you were inebriated
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.060]   and you went and got into a body of water, right?
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.080]   A pool or a lake or something,
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.920]   first of all, that's extremely dangerous
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.600]   to do while you're inebriated, right?
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.840]   People drown all the time.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.200]   People drown, they die as a consequence of doing that.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.000]   So please don't do that.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.120]   But also if it's a very cold water,
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.820]   your core body temperature is going to drop even further.
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.560]   Now, if you've heard the episodes that I've done
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.720]   on deliberate cold exposure,
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.120]   previously I've talked about how normally
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.360]   when people are not ingesting alcohol,
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.120]   they get into an ice bath or a cold shower
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.880]   and their body temperature initially dips,
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.480]   but then it rebounds and increases.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.000]   That's a process that's going to occur
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.640]   when people do not have alcohol in their system.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.040]   When you have alcohol in your system,
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.720]   one of the reasons that you become hypothermic
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.240]   is because there's a disruption
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.680]   in those hypothalamic brain areas,
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.700]   in particular the brain area
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.520]   called the medial preoptic area
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.480]   that regulates core body temperature.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.040]   So it's not so much that alcohol makes you cold,
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.540]   it's that alcohol disrupts the central command centers
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.880]   of the brain that control temperature regulation,
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.800]   and that leads you to be slightly hypothermic.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.220]   So if you then go get into a very cold lake
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.600]   or you get into even a cold shower or an ice bath,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.840]   there's the possibility of you going very, very far
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.280]   down the ladder into very hypothermic territory,
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.800]   and that can be very dangerous.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.440]   Now, in terms of dealing with hangover,
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.280]   when the alcohol has been largely cleared from your system,
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.000]   well, that's where some of this kind of old lore
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.680]   combines with some of the modern science and says,
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.360]   well, if you can spike adrenaline
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.280]   and certainly getting into an ice bath
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.920]   or getting into a cold shower
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.200]   or any kind of cold body of water,
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.420]   provided you can do that safely,
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.720]   that will sharply increase your adrenaline
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.800]   and I should say your dopamine, that's been shown,
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.440]   and we've talked about this on the podcast before,
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.840]   you get these long extended increases,
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.500]   several hours of increases in dopamine
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.860]   from deliberate cold exposure.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.280]   It's well-documented in humans, by the way.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.000]   So one could imagine using deliberate cold exposure
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.960]   as a way to accelerate the recovery from hangover.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.340]   Provided that's done safely,
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.560]   I think there's no reason to not explore that,
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.920]   and if you wonder what safely is
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.320]   and what temperatures to use,
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.600]   please check out the episode on deliberate cold exposure.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.920]   Cold showers, therefore, might actually be one way
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.720]   to at least partially relieve hangover.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.800]   Certainly the science from various places
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.360]   in the literature converge to say that,
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.740]   but again, be careful, please, please, please be careful
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.240]   not to get into cold water when you are inebriated.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.240]   It's absolutely dangerous for all the obvious reasons
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.760]   and it's dangerous also for the non-obvious reasons,
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.860]   not the least of which is the dramatic decreases
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.040]   in core body temperature
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.440]   that can make you dangerously hypothermic.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.720]   Now, how would you go about using deliberate cold exposure
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.600]   to accelerate recovery from hangover?
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.480]   Well, there I would look to the kind of standard protocols
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.640]   of, you know, one to three minutes
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.280]   or maybe even six minutes if you can tolerate it,
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.360]   or if you're really cold adapted,
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.820]   maybe you do seven or 10 minutes in a cold shower,
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.700]   although that could be a lot.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.360]   Most people are going to experience a sharp increase
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.700]   in epinephrine and adrenaline
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.280]   and a long-lasting increase in dopamine
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.520]   from one to three minutes of deliberate cold exposure,
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.240]   ideally done immersion up to the neck,
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.360]   again, do this safely, please, please, please,
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.280]   or a cold shower where you're getting under the shower
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.100]   as much as possible.
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:23.940]   How cold?
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.760]   Well, that's going to vary person to person.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.580]   I suggest making it as cold as is uncomfortable,
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.940]   such that you really want to get out,
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.340]   but then you know you can stay in safely
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.860]   without, for instance, giving yourself a heart attack,
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.480]   because if the water is really, really cold,
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.800]   of course you can give yourself a heart attack.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.460]   Most showers won't go that cold,
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.460]   although probably some will.
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.860]   Again, please use caution, spike your adrenaline,
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.940]   spike your dopamine with deliberate cold exposure safely.
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.260]   Other components of hangover that could be good targets
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.020]   for trying to alleviate hangover,
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.040]   and here I hope you are getting the picture
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.160]   because it is accurate to say
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.800]   that hangover is a multifaceted phenomenon.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.620]   It's not like one molecule in one receptor.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.860]   It's a bunch of things happening in the brain and body,
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.920]   but is the dehydration associated with alcohol.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.860]   Alcohol is a diuretic for multiple reasons.
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.840]   It causes people to excrete not only water,
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.920]   but also sodium.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.120]   Sodium is an electrolyte,
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.720]   critical for the function of neurons.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.640]   So making sure that you have enough sodium,
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.520]   potassium, and magnesium, so-called electrolytes,
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.040]   is going to be important for proper brain function,
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.640]   bodily organ function.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.680]   Even for people that have just had one or two drinks
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.520]   the night before,
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.960]   it's likely that your electrolyte balance
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.360]   and your fluid balance is going to be disrupted,
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.560]   and that's because alcohol also disrupts
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.400]   the so-called vasopressin pathway.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.560]   I talked a lot about vasopressin
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.060]   and the way that it interacts with
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.680]   and controls different aspects of water retention
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.240]   and water release from the body in the form of urine
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.240]   in the episode on salt.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.800]   So again, I'm referring to hubermanlab.com
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.300]   as the site where you can find that episode
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.160]   on salt balance and ways to restore electrolyte balance.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.800]   Having your electrolytes at the proper levels
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.400]   before you drink is ideal.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.260]   Some people will say for every glass of alcohol
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.920]   that you drink, you should drink one glass of water.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.120]   I would say better would be two glasses of water
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.100]   given the dehydrating effects of alcohol,
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.600]   and even better would be water with electrolytes.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.080]   That certainly would set you up
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.920]   for a better day the next day.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.200]   And if you don't manage to do that,
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.720]   'cause I suppose it's kind of geeky walking around
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.120]   with electrolyte packets out at the bar or whatnot,
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.160]   although, you know, geeky in my book is a good thing,
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.600]   the next day you could take some electrolytes upon waking,
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.680]   maybe even some before you go to sleep
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.000]   at the night of drinking.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.080]   So hangovers made worse by disturbed sleep,
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.920]   made worse by disrupted gut microbiome,
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.080]   made worse by disrupted electrolytes,
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.480]   made worse by the depletion of epinephrine and dopamine.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.880]   That's why replenishing the microbiome with fermented foods,
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.760]   low-sugar fermented foods, that is,
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.640]   that's why using safe, deliberate cold exposure
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.000]   for spiking adrenaline and for increasing dopamine,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.680]   and that's why consuming electrolytes
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.260]   are all going to be beneficial.
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.840]   [upbeat music]
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.000]   (upbeat music)
