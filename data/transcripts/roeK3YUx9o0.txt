[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:10.360]   Next up, I'm thrilled to dive into powerful new enterprise
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.000]   capabilities for WMB.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.520]   And first up, I want to highlight
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.560]   that we've recently refactored our approach to tracking
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.680]   distributed training jobs within our Python SDK.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.520]   Users can now easily log and then evaluate
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.880]   distributed training runs with WMB.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.560]   With multiprocessing now generally available
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.880]   and enabled by default, the user experience
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.880]   is significantly improved with distributed settings.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.500]   Simply call WMB in it from your training script
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.220]   and automatically track all of your distributed training
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.920]   runs from single or many processes
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.400]   and do this without sacrificing performance
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.720]   or the robustness of your jobs.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.400]   Easy grouping via our runs table allows
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.240]   you to seamlessly explore data from your multi-node training
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.400]   jobs.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.880]   Use our industry-leading ML visualizations
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.040]   to find exactly what you need from your distributed jobs.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.160]   Really cementing WMB as the leading enterprise experiment
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.520]   tracking solution, our approach to multiprocessing
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.760]   significantly improves the user experience
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.080]   and it ensures the reliability and robustness
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.520]   to errors or hanging jobs of your distributed training runs.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.140]   To learn more about our approach to multiprocessing,
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.480]   I encourage everyone to check out the guide that's linked
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.280]   at the bottom of this slide.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.780]   And you can go through in detail examples
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.620]   and understand exactly how our refactoring has
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.000]   benefited you, our core users.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.360]   I'm also really excited to announce WMB Dedicated
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.840]   Cloud for Azure.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.040]   The WMB Dedicated Cloud provides a secure and flexible
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.360]   managed private cloud environment,
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.160]   enabling enterprise ML ops at scale.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.080]   And with this release, we've added support
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.060]   from Microsoft Azure.
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.600]   So now, our Dedicated Cloud supports all three major cloud
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.700]   providers, Azure, GCP, and AWS.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.960]   Just as a reminder, we offer several deployment options
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.440]   for the WMB platform.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.560]   You can deploy on bare metal servers
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.720]   in your on-premise data centers, configure
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.000]   a customer-managed production deployment
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.920]   on your own private cloud.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.600]   We offer secure access via the multi-tenant public cloud
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   as software as a service.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.240]   And then finally, with the WMB Dedicated Cloud
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.200]   as a managed single-tenant cloud infrastructure,
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.140]   providing you with your choice of cloud provider and cloud
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.580]   region.
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.100]   With the WMB Dedicated Cloud, we offer the infrastructure
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.540]   management, and we're responsible for the platform
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.020]   performance, while giving you, the users,
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.180]   full control over your data with our secure storage connector.
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.740]   And this secure storage connector
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.660]   enables you to connect and manage your own secure object
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.140]   storage.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.720]   It's with this configuration that we really
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.500]   unlock enterprise-grade security controls, providing
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.280]   isolation guarantees that are aligned with even the most
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.460]   stringent security protocols, while we provide you
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.420]   the guarantees of ensuring uptime of your mission
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.320]   critical ML infrastructure.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.240]   Collectively, the WMB cloud is trusted
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.880]   by some of the largest and even the most regulated companies
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.320]   in the world to deliver ML ops at scale.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.880]   And we're really proud to now make it
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.200]   available on Microsoft Azure.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.480]   And throughout today's webinar, you
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.640]   may have noticed a common theme.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.800]   That's that Weights and Biases were really dedicated
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.720]   to meeting customers where they are.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.200]   And with more and more enterprises
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.920]   relying on Microsoft Enterprise applications and services,
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.240]   we added single sign-on authentication with Microsoft.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.720]   So in addition to supporting standard identity management
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.960]   tools like OpenID or Active Directory,
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.600]   customers can use third-party SSO providers
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.280]   like Google and GitHub to authenticate users for WMB
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.760]   access.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.080]   Logging into WMB with SSO authentication
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.320]   provides a really seamless experience
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.360]   for users with enterprise authentication providers.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.920]   And we're thrilled to now offer authentication with Microsoft.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.440]   With Azure Single Sign-on, we are
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.400]   providing a trouble-free and trusted access
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.040]   to WMB with a single Microsoft login,
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.920]   and that's without sacrificing any security.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.760]   So it's with this release, users can manage authentication
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.800]   with Microsoft, which is really a trusted standard
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.120]   with enterprise-proven authentication.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.720]   This means that when you as users
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.600]   invite others to collaborate on the WMB application,
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.400]   as long as they have a Microsoft account,
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.600]   they can automatically sign in and create a WMB account
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.040]   without further IT configuration.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.440]   And speaking about security, WMB
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.240]   is trusted by some of the largest companies in the world
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.200]   to deliver ML opposite scale.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.720]   Customers from around the world, they
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.480]   entrust us with their sensitive, mission-critical ML data.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.320]   And really, nothing is more important to us
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.720]   than honoring this custodial commitment
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.760]   to protect all of their mission-critical information.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.640]   So today, we're really proud to highlight our security
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.840]   position with the WMB Security and Compliance Center.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.080]   We encourage you to visit security.wmb.ai
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.920]   to review details of several of our security frameworks,
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.560]   our regulation alignment, and certifications that
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.520]   apply not only to our company, but also
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.480]   to our full suite of products and our deployment options.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.320]   The WMB Security Center, it's a centralized self-service
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.040]   portal, and it's made with enterprise customers in mind
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.280]   for fast and efficient evaluation of our enterprise
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.840]   security readiness.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.080]   Within the Security Center, we ensure
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.000]   that our customers have all the information
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.760]   they need for fast compliance to common industry security
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.680]   standards.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.120]   So again, we encourage everyone to visit this portal linked here
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.040]   on screen by going to security.wmb.ai.
