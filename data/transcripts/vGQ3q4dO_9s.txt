[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   - We have to talk a bit about the magical,
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.280]   the mysterious string theory, super string theory.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.120]   - Sure.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.320]   - There's still maybe this aspect of it,
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.880]   which is there's still, for me,
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.440]   from an outsider's perspective,
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.040]   this fascinating heated debate
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.660]   on the status of string theory.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.640]   Can you clarify this debate,
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.720]   perhaps articulating the various views,
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.800]   and say where you land on it?
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.200]   - So first of all, I doubt that I will be able
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.720]   to say anything to clarify the debate
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.720]   around string theory for a general audience.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.760]   Part of the reason is because string theory
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.680]   has done something I've never seen theoretical physics do.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.920]   It has broken out into consciousness
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.480]   of the general public before we're finished.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.880]   You see, string theory doesn't actually exist,
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.200]   because when we use the word theory,
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.160]   we mean a particular set of attributes.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.600]   In particular, it means that you have
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.960]   an overarching paradigm that explains
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.000]   what it is that you're doing.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   No such overarching paradigm exists for string theory.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.880]   What string theory is currently
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.880]   is an enormously large, mutually reinforcing
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.480]   collection of mathematical facts,
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.520]   in which we can find no contradictions.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.680]   We don't know why it's there,
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.800]   but we can certainly say that without challenge.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.560]   Now, just because you find a piece of mathematics
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.260]   doesn't mean that it applies to nature.
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.240]   And in fact, there has been a very heated debate
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.280]   about whether string theory is some sort of hysteria
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.040]   among the community of theoretical physicists,
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.480]   or whether it has something fundamental
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.440]   to say about our universe.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.960]   We don't yet know the answer to that question.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.560]   What those of us who study string theory will tell you
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.320]   are things like, string theory has been
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.240]   extraordinarily productive in getting us
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.200]   to think more deeply, even about mathematics
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.960]   that's not string theory, but the kind of mathematics
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.800]   that we've used to describe elementary particles.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.600]   There have been spin-offs from string theory,
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.560]   and this has been going on now for two decades almost,
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.000]   that have allowed us, for example,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.320]   to more accurately calculate the force between electrons
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.600]   with the presence of quantum mechanics.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.120]   This is not something you hear about in the public.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.880]   There are other similar things,
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.680]   that kind of property I just told you about
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.680]   is what's called weak-strong duality,
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.920]   and it comes directly from string theory.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.800]   There are other things such as
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.000]   a property called holography, which allows one
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.280]   to take equations and look at them
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.000]   on the boundary of a space, and then to know information
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.720]   about inside the space without actually
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.400]   doing calculations there.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.040]   This has come directly from string theory.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.520]   So there are a number of direct mathematical effects
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.320]   that we learn in string theory, but we take these ideas
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.280]   and look at math that we already know,
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.440]   and we find suddenly we're more powerful.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.240]   This is a pretty good indication there's something
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.120]   interesting going on with string theory itself.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.960]   - So it's the early days of a powerful
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.000]   mathematical framework.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.200]   - That's what we have right now.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.720]   - What are the big, first of all,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.440]   for most people, probably, which as you said,
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.360]   most general public would know actually
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.900]   what string theory is, which is at the highest level,
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.480]   which is a fascinating fact.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.040]   - Well, string theory is what they do
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.600]   on the Big Bang Theory, right?
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.360]   (laughing)
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.240]   One, can you maybe describe what is string theory,
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.160]   and two, what are the open challenges?
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.440]   - So what is string theory?
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.940]   Well, the simplest explanation I can provide
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.000]   is to go back and ask what are particles,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.520]   which is the question you first asked me.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.640]   - What's the smallest thing?
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.920]   - Yeah, what's the smallest thing?
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.920]   So, particles, one way I try to describe
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.640]   particles to people to start,
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.800]   I want you to imagine a little ball.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.560]   And I want you to let the size of that ball
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.960]   shrink until it has no extent whatsoever.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.720]   But it still has the mass of the ball.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.720]   That's actually what Newton was working with
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.200]   when he first invented physics.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.080]   He's the real inventor of the massive particle,
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.440]   which is this idea that underlies all of physics.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.360]   So that's where we start.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.000]   It's a mathematical construct that you get
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.200]   by taking a limit of things that you know.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.800]   So what's a string?
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.240]   Well, in the same analogy, I would say,
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.200]   now I want you to start with a piece of spaghetti.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.160]   So we all know what that looks like.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.760]   And now I want you to let the thickness of the spaghetti
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.520]   shrink until it has no thickness.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.120]   Mathematically, I mean, in words this makes no sense,
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.040]   but mathematically this actually works.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.440]   And you get this mathematical object out.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.400]   It has properties that are like spaghetti.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.160]   It can wiggle and jiggle,
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.680]   but it can also move collectively
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.480]   like a piece of spaghetti.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.040]   It's the mathematics of those sorts of objects
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.620]   that constitute string theory.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.920]   - And does the multidimensional, 11-dimensional,
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.920]   however many dimensional, more than four dimension,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.840]   is that a crazy idea to you?
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.040]   Is that the stranger aspect of string theory to you?
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.600]   - Not really.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.280]   And also partly because of my own research.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.560]   So earlier we talked about these strange symbols
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.080]   that we've discovered inside the equations.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.040]   It turns out that to a very large extent,
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.380]   a dinkers don't really care about the number of dimensions.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.300]   They kind of have an internal mathematical consistency
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.920]   that allows them to be manifest
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.800]   in many different dimensions.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.280]   Since supersymmetry is a part of string theory,
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.200]   then this same property you would expect
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.340]   to be inherited by string theory.
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.380]   However, another little known fact,
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.160]   which is not in the public debate,
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.720]   is that there are actually strings
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.720]   that are only four dimensional.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.440]   This is something that was discovered
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.800]   at the end of the 80s
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.720]   by three different groups of physicists
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.840]   working independently.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.400]   I and my friend Warren Siegel,
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.520]   who were at the University of Maryland at the time,
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.640]   were able to prove that there's mathematics
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.940]   that looks totally four dimensional,
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.520]   and yet it's a string.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.120]   There was a group in Germany
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.720]   that used slightly different mathematics,
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.520]   but they found the same result.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.280]   And then there was a group at Cornell
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.520]   who using yet a third piece of mathematics
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.360]   found the same result.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.400]   So the fact that extra dimensions
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.680]   is so widely talked about in the public
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.680]   is partly a function of how the public
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.240]   has come to understand string theory
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.520]   and how the story has been told to them.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.920]   But there are alternatives you don't know about.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.080]   (silence)
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.240]   (silence)
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.400]   (silence)
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.560]   (silence)
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.720]   (silence)
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.880]   (silence)
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.040]   (silence)
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:04.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
