[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.560]   And in this episode, I want to talk about inflation and the future of inflation and
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.360]   why things should be okay.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.360]   Don't panic.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.920]   I think things will be all right.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.460]   The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported prices have gone up 6.2%, which was the highest
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.360]   annual increase since 1990.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.980]   People are pissed off because meat is up 20% in terms of prices.
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.040]   Gas prices are up 50% from 2020.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.040]   And people are just flustered.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.420]   So you see that being reflected in the presidential rating and also the vice president rating.
[00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.480]   People don't find Biden and Kamala Harris to be doing a good job.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.520]   And so President Biden has said he's going to make it one of his missions to get prices
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.160]   back down.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.260]   And the reality is, prices will come down, folks.
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.260]   And do you know why?
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.740]   Well, it's because we live in a capitalist society where we all want to make more money.
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.260]   And so when prices are high, what happens?
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.560]   Supply increases, right?
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.000]   Because if you're a company, you are going to try to capture that excess profit margin
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.880]   by producing more goods.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.800]   But there's always this whiplash.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.560]   It's called a bullwhip effect, where you recognize prices are high, and then it takes a while
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.600]   to ramp up production.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.620]   And then by the time you ramp up production, everybody else and every other company is
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.080]   ramping up production.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.300]   And then there becomes excess supply, and then prices actually crash.
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.740]   So we're right now in the thick of inflation frenzy, and people are upset about paying
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.960]   way more money at the pump and at the grocery store.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.980]   But we should be thinking forward over the next 12 months about a potential excess supply
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.260]   scenario where prices crash.
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.860]   So we've talked about this with housing market, for example, many of the Texas City housing
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.940]   markets like Austin have upcoming supply.
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.240]   That supply is coming and prices are up massively, right?
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.780]   So I would be a little bit careful about buying real estate or investing real estate in Texas
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.780]   cities.
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.880]   On the flip side, I want to look for cities where prices haven't increased as much and
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.380]   have really restrictive supply.
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.220]   So a lot of people here in San Francisco complain about government bureaucracy, bloated budget,
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.980]   inefficiency, corruption, and so forth.
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.900]   But as an investor, you got to think, well, actually, that's pretty good, because all
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.460]   that stuff really slows down the process of creating more homes.
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.460]   And that's good for pricing.
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.940]   So you always got to think yin yang when it comes to finance.
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.180]   And as a financial samurai reader and podcast listener, you should think about inflation
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.220]   also as a positive, because you own real assets.
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.380]   You own stocks, you own real estate, you own other assets that benefit from inflation,
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.420]   because these assets are part of the inflation index.
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.420]   So if prices are going up, inflation is going up, that means your assets are going up as
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.420]   well.
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.900]   And frankly, stocks, real estate, and other assets have gone up much higher than the stated
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.900]   inflation rate.
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.900]   The S&P 500 is up around 25% so far year to date.
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.940]   So 6.2% inflation, you're still way winning.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.300]   You're really winning on a real level.
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.100]   The median national home price is up something like 15% to 17%.
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.500]   So again, you're winning.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.140]   You're real winning.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.980]   And the thing to think about is what's next.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.500]   So you want to compare the inflation rate, which came in at 6.22%, which is the highest
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.580]   in 30 years, to where the 10-year bond yield, which is at about 1.6%.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.580]   In other words, the real yield for the 10-year bond yield is temporarily negative 4.6%.
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.820]   1.6% minus 6.22%, negative 4.6%.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.060]   So as an investor, you think, "Well, why the hell would I buy a 10-year bond yield yielding
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.540]   a real negative 4.6%?"
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.620]   I wouldn't.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.620]   Most people wouldn't.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.020]   So they would put that capital in more risky assets to try to hopefully earn a greater
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.820]   real return.
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.980]   Now thinking about the future, and if you look at the historical inflation numbers,
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:23.420]   it ranges since, let's say, 2012 between a low of about 1% to a high of about 3.8% to
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.100]   now 6.22%.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.740]   So rationally, you can think, "Well, inflation will probably moderate over the next 12 to
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.780]   18 months because supply chain issues will be figured out."
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.420]   We talk about, again, companies being profit-seeking, and they're going to launch new supply.
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:47.140]   So you can see the scenario where inflation comes down to maybe 3.5%, 3% right back into
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.540]   that historical channel, and the upside of that channel is about 3.5%, 3.7%.
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.780]   And then you can see, as the economy improves and how inflation continues to stay higher
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.060]   than average, how the 10-year bond yield could creep up to maybe about 2%.
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.840]   This is what Wall Street economists and strategists have been forecasting for years and years
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.260]   and years.
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.300]   Not to great success, let's be frank, but that's what their jobs pay them to do, and
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.980]   so that's what they're going to do.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.700]   And I don't have this job, but I'm telling you that inflation is likely going to come
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.060]   down and normalize, and the 10-year bond yield will probably creep up, but it's not going
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.900]   to creep up as high as you think.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.300]   So let's say inflation rate at 3%, 10-year bond yield at 2%, this is 12 months from now,
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.660]   that still is a negative real yield, which means in this scenario that money is going
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:47.020]   to continue to flow to risk assets like stocks, real estate, cryptocurrencies, alternative
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.020]   investments, and so forth.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.460]   So your goal, if you've been negatively affected by inflation, is to hold on and to adjust.
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.340]   Hold on for continued inflation in your investments, but adjust in terms of finding alternatives
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.780]   to save money.
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.380]   For example, food inflation may be up 5.3%, but are you going to let it get you down?
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:15.580]   No, you're going to find ways to consume less, buy more in bulk, and eat more leftovers to
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.580]   save.
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.340]   You can make it even a fun game where you try to intermittent fast or skip a meal as
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:27.180]   long as food inflation is above 3%, because it's not going to be at 5.3% forever, it's
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.400]   going to moderate.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.420]   And who knows, during this time while you're playing your game and having a challenge,
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.940]   you might even lose some weight in the process.
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.060]   Hey, that's what I would do.
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.220]   I would happily lose 5 pounds, 10 pounds even.
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.540]   That'd be great.
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.100]   And yes, you could try and replace caloric intake with cheaper, unhealthier foods, which
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.020]   is what a lot of people say will happen.
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.980]   But why not turn a negative situation into a positive challenge?
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.300]   That is the financial samurai mindset.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.820]   Always think about the opportunities that may arise from suboptimal situations.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.020]   All right, folks, I hope you enjoyed this latest episode.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.660]   I am going to be finishing up my book this month.
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.660]   I'm really excited.
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.020]   I've worked so, so hard on this book, but it's going to be great.
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.580]   And I think it's going to provide a lot of value.
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.580]   So by the end of this year, the editors will be done, the art will be in, the stories will
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.380]   be written, and things are going to be great.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.660]   And I'll send you guys the link in the newsletter to pre-order.
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:29.140]   The URL is financialsamurai.com/newsletter if you want to sign up, and I'll talk to you
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.940]   all later.
