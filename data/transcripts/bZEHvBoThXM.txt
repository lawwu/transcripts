[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:38.860]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.040]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.200]   of Bogo Heads on Investing.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.000]   This podcast, as with all podcasts,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.760]   are brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.280]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.480]   In this podcast, we have Dr. Joe Davis, Vanguard's Global Chief
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.600]   Economist and head of Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group,
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.680]   whose research team is responsible for helping
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.320]   to oversee the firm's investment methodologies and asset
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.600]   allocation strategies for both institutional and individual
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.600]   investors.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.120]   In addition, Joe is a member of the Senior Portfolio
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.080]   Management Team for Vanguard's Fixed Income Group.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.880]   Today, we're going to be discussing a new report,
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.040]   Vanguard Global and Economic Market Outlook for 2020,
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.560]   the New Age of Uncertainty.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.880]   The report is available online at Vanguard.com.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.920]   With no further ado, let's bring in Dr. Joe Davis.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.200]   Welcome, doctor.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.800]   Thanks, Rick.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.760]   You can call me Joe, and really, thanks for having me.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.840]   Well, thank you so much for being on our show today, Joe.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.980]   We're really fans of your work, and you've
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.000]   given some fantastic presentations
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.680]   to the Bogleheads over the years.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.360]   What I wanted to do today was get your team's outlook
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.120]   on 2020.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.320]   But before we start there, who is Joe Davis?
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.960]   Can you give us a little background
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.160]   and some tidbits of your life and your bio?
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.660]   Sure.
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.040]   Well, I actually grew up 10 minutes from the Vanguard
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.560]   building I work in here outside of Philadelphia.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.780]   I was attracted to Vanguard because I was an early investor
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.220]   in the early '90s, and that's thanks to my dad.
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.860]   He had the wisdom to show me how to start investing.
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.900]   I came out of graduate school with a PhD in economics.
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.980]   I was actually thinking I would end up up
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.620]   on Wall Street in New York.
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.980]   But again, my dad said, why don't you apply to Vanguard?
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.740]   So I did.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.460]   And my resume found its hands into a group
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.660]   that they were just starting, a group
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.820]   that I now have the great pleasure of leading.
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.220]   I thought leadership group, effectively a research group.
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.620]   And that was 17 years ago, Rick.
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.420]   And so it's amazing.
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.420]   I count myself very lucky and fortunate
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.780]   to work with such a great company.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.420]   And our group has grown from, in those early days in 2002,
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.180]   2003, from fewer than 10 crew members
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.140]   to now we're over 65 and growing.
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.380]   And we're in multiple countries, including Europe and Asia.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.620]   So it's an exciting group to be a part of,
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.300]   and I count myself fortunate.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.660]   One of the Bogleheads did ask, who
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.020]   is the audience for the work that you're doing?
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.300]   Because as Bogleheads, we're basically
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.580]   following buy-hold strategies.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.220]   You do a lot of work, and you make a lot of predictions
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.380]   about GDP growth, earnings growth.
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.220]   You actually put out marked forecasts.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.340]   And so how does a typical individual investor take that?
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.020]   Is it supposed to be actionable?
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.660]   Or who's it for, and how should it be taken?
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.100]   Yeah, see, I see three primary users or use cases
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.060]   for our annual publication.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.980]   First is just, I think for many, is just
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.780]   to orient or to help provide investors
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.300]   with what are reasonable expected returns
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.420]   for the portfolios or investment that they are already in.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.740]   This is not and has never been and never
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.860]   will be supposed to be used as market timing
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.860]   calls and short-term prognostications, which
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.060]   I, quite frankly, I see from many in the industry.
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.260]   This is to help inform what is a reasonable expected
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.740]   return on a portfolio to help one achieve one's goals.
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.060]   And before I came to Vanguard, we
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.140]   did not have forward-looking expectations.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.540]   And so that's been a big step forward
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.540]   for many, including internally at Vanguard.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.700]   Secondly, this is an input into the active manage process.
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.500]   So for those investors that are perhaps in our actively managed
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.180]   bond funds, whether they're taxable or they're municipal,
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.300]   our economic outlook is an important ingredient
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.300]   because in those funds, we are taking modest active risk,
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.180]   meaning trying to outperform the benchmark in a very
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.180]   risk-controlled way.
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.220]   And to try to do that, one of the many levers
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.860]   that the portfolio management team will pull
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.460]   will be a risk assessment of what
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.980]   the markets are pricing in from an interest rate
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.380]   or, say, an economic growth outlook.
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.260]   And then how do we view the risk skewed relative to that sort
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.580]   of view in the marketplace?
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.780]   Again, all in the interest and the objective
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.060]   to try to modestly and incrementally
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.060]   add value for the shareholder in the funds.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.860]   Many times, we view that as just as much
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.580]   not taking excessive risk as it would be
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.620]   for trying to take more risk.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.380]   And a great example is even right now
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.140]   where I can feel and can sense in the market
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.820]   is becoming increasingly overly optimistic on growth.
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.300]   We see pockets of the financial markets
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.420]   where I would view as frothy risk-taking.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.700]   And so for a long-term investor that are in these funds,
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.540]   we are managing, based upon our outlook,
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.780]   to not be as aggressive as other funds may be,
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.300]   which we believe in the long run will reward our investors
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.300]   in those funds.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.340]   And then the third would be for those
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.300]   that would retain Vanguard from an advice perspective.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.860]   Because again, for certain investors
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.900]   who may have either a fixed spending goal,
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.420]   it may be an institution that has
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.940]   to generate a certain spending flow from their portfolio,
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.980]   or others, the variations in expected returns
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.060]   in the marketplace-- again, not in the one year,
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.980]   but in the next five or 10 years--
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.340]   can then have implications for the asset allocation strategies
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.900]   that they would pursue.
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.300]   For some that have a very, very long horizon,
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.340]   I would tell those investors that they
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.740]   should ignore all outlooks, including our own,
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.540]   if they have a very long horizon.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.700]   Because the buy and hold, stay the course,
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.700]   is very much appropriate.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.420]   But for years, when I came to Vanguard,
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.020]   I think what a common refrain would be would be, hey,
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.740]   does Vanguard have an opinion on x or y?
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.820]   And I think many, many investors want to stay the course,
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.620]   but sometimes they also struggle with the headlines.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.500]   And so one of the other primary objectives of this piece
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.260]   is to say, yes, these are the probabilities that
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.780]   may occur in the future, whether it's
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.980]   economic risk or financial market volatility,
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.580]   that we have thought about it, and it's
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.700]   reflected in our thinking and in the advice that we give clients.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.780]   So basically, three ideas.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.180]   Number one, your individual investors
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.620]   already have their portfolios set and their asset allocation.
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.500]   And so it's just sort of long-term estimates
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.700]   of expected return from bonds and equities
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.540]   so that they can do some planning.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.980]   And then number two, it's for your active funds
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.100]   so that they can maybe do some tailoring
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.580]   and potentially pick up some excess return or some alpha.
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.900]   And last, you were saying there are large institutional
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.460]   investors who actually buy your research
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.380]   or pay you to give this assessment.
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.260]   And those are the three areas where you
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.940]   find people use your report.
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.580]   Yeah, and some will just use it as an input
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.260]   into assessing the risk.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.420]   Because at the end of the day, all of us as investors
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.700]   are making decisions under uncertainty
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.860]   in terms of our asset allocation, right?
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.860]   Even if we haven't changed our asset allocation,
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.700]   it's still a decision, whether implicit or explicit.
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.540]   And so the value that we hope to bring
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.100]   is to convey the range of ultimate outcomes,
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.580]   particularly with respect to returns.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.980]   And respectfully, I think we do it in a very rigorous way.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.540]   I mean, we take some of the best techniques in academia,
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.820]   but we do it in a way where we convey, I believe,
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.740]   the market outlook as it should be,
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.740]   which is a range of outcomes.
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.900]   We're not offering short-term point forecasts.
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.900]   Vanguard doesn't have an S&P 500 target for the end of 2020.
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.100]   I actually kind of laugh at those sort of outlooks.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.260]   And so I think if we can convey the range of outcomes
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.260]   and the rationale for why it is today versus perhaps what it
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.980]   would have been 10 years ago, I think that can be of value.
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.860]   I'll give you an example where it helped some investors,
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.820]   Rick, like 10 years ago.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.740]   Our first annual outlook publication
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.260]   came out in the 2009 period, which you can recall.
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.460]   It was not a fun time in the markets.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.740]   And we had a great deal of clients wondering,
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.860]   should they even be in equities at all?
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.540]   And this publication helped some in the sense that we said,
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.940]   listen, the economic environment for the next several years
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.540]   is going to be where I have elevated unemployment.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.140]   It's going to be fairly tepid growth.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.220]   Yet the outlook for the financial markets,
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.380]   as best we can assess over the next five or 10 years,
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.020]   believe it or not, actually the odds
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.820]   are tilted towards higher than average expected returns.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.300]   And if anything, we turned it out
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.900]   to be a little too low in our projections, our range.
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.780]   It came in a little bit higher than expected.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.740]   But I think that was helpful because behaviorally
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.500]   and emotionally at that time, it felt as if--
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.900]   I would even have friends and colleagues in my family
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.580]   that said, listen, I feel like I really
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.140]   should get out of the market.
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.940]   And so even having that conversation,
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.740]   the rationale for why the expected returns were even
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.500]   higher, you could show that for some that are really
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.820]   mathematically inclined, you could show them statistical
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.620]   rigor, why historically there's a reason to believe this.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.340]   I think that had a service to investors.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.420]   This publication is not in any way
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.780]   intended to pick market tops and bottoms.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.780]   We're really trying to inform investors
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.580]   that this is the range of expected returns
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.620]   that you could see in your portfolio.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:29.220]   I think that your estimate of a globally diversified 60% stock,
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.180]   40% bond portfolio, you have a range of four to six,
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.620]   so call it the midpoint, about five.
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.420]   Seems to me to be very realistic and a good planning point.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.940]   We have to have something to plan with.
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.020]   We have to have some number to use.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.060]   And I think that your numbers are
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.500]   as good as anything anybody could come up with.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.140]   But the way you get to them, though,
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.780]   in reading through your report, you
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.940]   start out by looking at, it seems, the business cycle.
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.980]   Could you explain about the business cycle
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.140]   and where do you think we are?
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.660]   Well, we're at one of the later stages of the business
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.620]   cycle in the sense of how long this global expansion, which
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.500]   is going on more than 11 years--
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.780]   and we expect it to continue into 2020.
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.740]   And why that matters, assess where you are in the cycle,
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.780]   it has implications for two things.
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.900]   One is, historically at least, when
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.980]   you're in the late stages of any expansion,
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.460]   two things tend to emerge.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.740]   One is you tend to have the financial markets not only
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.140]   performing very well, which is good,
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.200]   but you tend to have financial markets outperforming
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.300]   the fundamentals.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.020]   And so in that environment, investors can feel very good.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.380]   But precisely because of how we approach
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.500]   the forward-looking return, we expect the future returns
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.660]   become more modest.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.940]   And so it's important to identify
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.380]   where you are in that cycle at a high level
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.940]   because that does inform how one should be thinking
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.220]   about everything from rebalancing to the return
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.740]   estimates that they assume.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.020]   We estimate that the global economy will more likely
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.880]   than not continue to expand, but growth will not
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.700]   accelerate, at least to the extent
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.940]   that at least parts of the stock market
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.620]   increasingly already anticipate.
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.820]   And so it will be one of these somewhat of a paradox in 2020
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.620]   is that we could have economic growth not be negative,
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.420]   the expansion continue, and yet you
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.180]   could have the financial markets underperform for a time.
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.300]   And just to be prepared for that.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.260]   We do not see strong evidence of financial market bubbles,
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.040]   which occurred late in the business cycle,
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.420]   say in 1998, 1999.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.300]   You could call it a NASDAQ or a dot-com.
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.660]   We don't see the imbalances in other parts of the economy,
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.080]   much like we saw in housing, certainly in late 2006
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.260]   and early 2007.
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.140]   There are, though, imbalances, I think,
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.740]   in the high level of corporate debt,
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.340]   high level of sovereign debt in some countries.
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.900]   And we've had extended period of very loose monetary conditions
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.260]   generated by central banks.
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.460]   So that's what keeps us up at night a little bit.
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.900]   But I think at the end of the day,
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.180]   it's not the worst outlook.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.540]   It's just one I think we're just trying to set lower,
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.060]   but I still think reasonable.
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.300]   And they're not bearish.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.300]   It's not a bearish outlook on either the world economy
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.400]   or the financial market.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.680]   I find it interesting that a year ago, after the Fed had
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.140]   increased rates three times last year,
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:27.300]   but then the forecast was for three more rate increases
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.340]   in 2019.
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.520]   But in fact, what we had was three rate decreases
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.180]   rather rapidly.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.980]   And in addition, around the world,
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.420]   monetary policy makers just been decreasing.
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.340]   Is that a warning sign?
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.340]   I mean, yeah, I mean, one of our outlook last year,
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.180]   the theme of it was down but not out.
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.020]   And it was a boxing analogy, meaning the global economy was
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.900]   going to weaken significantly based
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.980]   upon the leading indicators, which we track very closely
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.580]   internally at Vanguard, again, used in the portfolio
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.620]   management process.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.620]   And they weakened in China in early 2018.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.940]   They weakened in the US in 2018.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.840]   And so that foretold, at some point in 2019,
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.960]   roughly around the summer, that we were going to have
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.460]   what we called growth scares.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.260]   And we published that in early 2019,
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.780]   that we were more likely than not
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:24.060]   going to see a slowdown in growth, which many did not
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.940]   at least anticipate of severity.
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.620]   Now, in part because of that slowdown,
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.780]   our probability of recession almost approached 50%,
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.060]   which unnerved us a little bit.
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.860]   Because obviously, if you have a recession,
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.340]   equity market historically has been down at least 20%.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.140]   The irony of it is that I think the Federal Reserve and some
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.220]   other central banks were observing and have
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.700]   similar models as we do, Rick.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.980]   And so I think that ultimately, they
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.660]   reacted much more aggressively.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.580]   And so cut rates, I think, would stabilize the situation.
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.700]   Quite frankly, they reacted more strongly
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.340]   than I would have anticipated.
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.500]   I could have perhaps seen one cut.
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.500]   Because it was really just in the bond market,
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.500]   particularly the shape of the yield curve that
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.060]   seemed the most ominous sign of potential recession.
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.820]   But other indicators, both in the economy,
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.300]   outside of manufacturing, as well as the equity market,
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.100]   were not displaying the same signals,
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.540]   which is why our probabilities never got above 50%.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.660]   So it did surprise me how aggressively they reacted.
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.280]   But then that was one of the reasons why
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.900]   the second half of the year, the financial markets
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.300]   performed as well as they did.
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.940]   Not the only reason, but that certainly
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.180]   was a primary catalyst.
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.860]   Yeah, we went from an inverted yield curve
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.220]   to now it's getting to look almost more
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.180]   like a normal yield curve as longer-term rates continue
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.420]   to creep up here and short-term rates come down.
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.340]   So there's no longer an inverted yield curve.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.340]   Now, some people will say, well, that's good.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.940]   That means no recession is coming.
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.660]   Our probability of recession uses all the signals
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.460]   in the marketplace, but we combine them
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.900]   in a way that's actually more accurate in general
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.780]   than just the bond market alone or the stock market alone.
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.740]   It's actually the power of a diversified set of signals.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.940]   So that'll be the power of diversification,
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:08.860]   diversified portfolio.
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.260]   We use a diversified portfolio of signals, over 100 in all,
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.060]   that you can use to assess what the risks are in the economy.
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.820]   And it's improved, although we're not completely out
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.140]   of the wood yet.
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.260]   One of the reasons why, although we
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.160]   don't see a recession in 2020, there's
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.020]   going to be uneven growth next year.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.420]   And so I think the bond market's starting
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.500]   to come to the realization of that.
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.300]   The equity market, quite frankly,
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.060]   has priced in a much better economic outcome
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.660]   than I even think is reasonable.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.380]   And so that's why I still think in the near term,
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.500]   we just have to be prepared for some volatility.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.860]   I've been reading a lot about manufacturing declines
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.020]   in manufacturing activity.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.060]   In fact, the Kansas City Fed recently
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.220]   announced that their district has had,
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.540]   I think it's several months in a row now,
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.500]   a manufacturing decline.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.220]   And globally, there appears to continue
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.860]   to be this manufacturing decline.
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:09.300]   And how is that impacting into your GDP growth estimates?
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.660]   It's been a primary factor.
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.700]   It's been a factor of why we foresaw significant global
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.740]   slowdown this year, relative to 2018, which
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.140]   occurred in almost every market.
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.640]   One of the reasons that fed into the central bank switching
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.300]   course in various markets around the world,
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.380]   and one of the reasons why we're less bullish, so to speak,
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.220]   than I think many increasingly are for 2020,
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.500]   there's three reasons why the manufacturing
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.300]   sector in particular have been underperforming,
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.260]   or in many parts of the world, including in the United States,
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.100]   contracting, meaning in recession.
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.260]   One was set in motion two or three years ago.
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.440]   And that was it was a high level of inventories
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.740]   in the manufacturing sector.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.180]   And so there's generally been, in the past 10 years,
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.940]   a three-year sort of expansionary sort of tailwind
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.180]   to manufacturing, and then it slows down for a time.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.060]   And you could see that clearly in our signals.
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.860]   And we're not completely done that,
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.900]   but we're still working through it.
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.340]   And that's why we've seen weakness
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.660]   across the manufacturing front.
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.540]   Secondly, it's been in motion for 10 years,
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.160]   and that is the structural slowdown, intentionally,
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.540]   in China, as they continue to try to rebalance and escape
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.340]   what many call the middle income trap, meaning they've become
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.680]   more developed, become more consumer-based.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.180]   And they've been successful to date,
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.340]   but the past days of even 6% growth, I think, are over.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.060]   And so that has particularly impacted parts
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.900]   of the manufacturing sector.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.500]   But the third one, and clearly the most cyclical one,
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.140]   has been the trade tension between the US and China.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.180]   We model that as best we can, and it's
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.420]   the high level of uncertainty.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.580]   In fact, that's the title of our publication this year,
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.380]   The New Age of Uncertainty, that why we call it that
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.460]   is that we believe that this recent significant rise
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.540]   in uncertainty is unlikely to unravel quickly.
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.420]   That has led to slower than expected business investment,
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.060]   and that primarily hits, or certainly hits,
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.540]   the manufacturing sector.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:08.660]   So one of the byproducts of this slowdown in manufacturing
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.940]   and global manufacturing are corporate profits.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.980]   Now, S&P earnings have been increasing,
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:23.580]   in part because of tax cuts, in part because of buybacks.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.380]   So we have this divergence between S&P earnings
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:30.500]   that are increasing and national profits
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.200]   based on GDP, national accounts, that
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.340]   has actually been declining.
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.100]   And a Wall Street Journal article recently
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.460]   brought this to light, I think, a couple of weeks ago.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.980]   Can you comment on that?
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.300]   Profit margins are still fairly robust
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.860]   when you look at the aggregate data.
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.300]   I mean, they have weakened in a growth rate perspective,
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.940]   but I would say there's two things going on.
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.860]   One is just the high level of profitability.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.180]   It's particularly impressive in the United States.
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.460]   It's one of the reasons why I think
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.900]   the US has been among the stronger, or at least
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.260]   the more stable, economic performers and equity market
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.060]   performers over the past several years.
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.060]   It's just the high level of profitability.
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.420]   Now that the rate of increase has clearly slowed,
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.300]   part of that is just due to the economic environment.
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.980]   The weakness, particularly, we've seen overseas.
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.140]   There was a point in time this year
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:27.260]   which we estimate China was growing well below 5%,
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.860]   perhaps as low as 3% or 4%, which wasn't
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.140]   reported in the statistics.
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.820]   We saw significant weakness in other emerging markets
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.980]   and in Europe, Germany and others, which again, part of
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.860]   them are exposed to weakness in China.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.780]   And so we've seen a deceleration in that.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.340]   And then, of course, the equity market
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.620]   has continued to perform well, I think in part
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.220]   because corporate profitability didn't go significantly
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.140]   negative when recession odds were being discussed.
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.740]   But I think for just other just sentimental reasons,
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.420]   and so you've had this valuation.
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.860]   The P/E ratios have just widened further
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.540]   because earnings haven't been keeping up
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.460]   to the same level of appreciation as prices.
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.060]   And then as you noted, Rick, there's
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.500]   been a more of a longer term, four or five years,
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.300]   the M&A activity, the buyback activity,
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.460]   more so than the rate of natural investment in companies
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.860]   on growth prospects, something I would call sometimes
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.300]   financial engineering, has been significant pace.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.940]   And then another reason, which is not often discussed,
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.100]   and it won't change quarter to quarter,
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.300]   but another reason or contributed
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.660]   to the high level of corporate profitability,
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.380]   it is a little modestly concentrated
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.700]   in a handful of firms.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.540]   And part of that is, I think, the nature
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.260]   of the digital economy, what I would call network effects.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.580]   And so very large companies may be
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:57.700]   able to maintain high profit margins or high profit levels,
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.420]   whether growth is accelerating or decelerating.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.100]   There's longer term issues and behaviors.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.340]   I think that can help explain the high level
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.500]   of corporate profitability.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.500]   But then there's also the business cycle effect,
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.500]   which tends to get most of the press attention.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.260]   Let's move into the labor markets,
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.100]   because I have a real question about this.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.300]   I'm a baby boomer.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.460]   I'll be 62 next year, and I see all of my compadres
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.860]   from high school and college getting
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.420]   ready to leave the labor force over the next year or two
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:28.420]   or three.
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:33.460]   And if we get a lot of people leaving the labor force
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.300]   because they're retiring, how is that
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.820]   going to affect things like inflation, demand, and so
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:41.860]   forth?
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.620]   Yeah, I mean, it's an important issue.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.460]   I would put the aging of the workforce alone
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.100]   as just the slower rate of population growth
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.540]   we have in the US, and in other countries,
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.860]   versus, say, 10 or 20 years ago.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.380]   Slower demographic forces have already
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.020]   had, I think, a clear imprint on a number of things.
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.500]   One is just, what are the expectations for growth?
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.740]   What's the natural run rate, so-called the average speed
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.900]   limit for any economy?
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.460]   We used to talk in the United States
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.460]   that a reasonable growth rate for, say, real GDP
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.940]   was 3% in the '90s.
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.140]   Or the good old days.
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.140]   Yeah, the good old days.
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.140]   No, of course, that was propped up
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.780]   by leverage, which we ended up paying the price for in terms
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.540]   of the housing market and in the global financial crisis.
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.860]   But yeah, the natural run rate for the US economy right now
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.660]   is slightly below 2%.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.100]   One of the reasons for that is the aging of the workforce
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.420]   and just the retirement.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.260]   Population growth is not negative,
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.780]   but it has clearly slowed.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.900]   And so the potential growth rate of the economy is lower.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:50.420]   Now, that does have an implication for inflation.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.580]   You would say, then, if you have slower potential,
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.780]   let's call it 1 and 1/2 GDP growth.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.740]   And we've been growing in the United States roughly 2%,
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.780]   the past four or five years, right?
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.460]   You would then expect inflation to rear its head sooner.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.180]   Because even though you're growing slower
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.500]   than historical averages, you're going above the speed limit.
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.460]   So inflation is like a speeding ticket, right?
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.800]   You only get that speeding ticket
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.180]   if you're going above the speed limit.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.340]   I will compliment our team.
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.420]   We put our finger on this four or five years ago,
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.340]   that there's been other forces that
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.460]   have been more than offsetting the inflationary pressures
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.300]   that you would think from less slack in the economy, which
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.300]   is really one way of saying, regardless of your growth rate,
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.180]   if you have fewer available workers,
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.940]   eventually you're going to see wage pressures and everything.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.500]   But one of those forces is digital technology,
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.060]   which has been a suppressant, keeping prices down.
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.100]   It's everything from online sales
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.460]   to just cheaper costs of manufacturing
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.860]   certain products and services.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.780]   And we were one of the first firms
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.100]   to actually quantify what that drag is.
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:57.300]   So what this means, I think the demographic imprint going
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.100]   forward, it's one of the reasons--
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.700]   not the only one-- one of the reasons why interest rates are
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.100]   lower today in the United States and in Europe
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.820]   and in other parts of the world is because of slower population
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:11.380]   growth.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:15.580]   And again, it's tied to lower expected economic growth, which
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.560]   has led to those lower interest rates.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.780]   There's a point with which it'll reverse.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.140]   When the global economy-- and it's roughly five years
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.740]   from now, and again, this is very slow moving.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.500]   It won't happen in one month, in any one year.
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.140]   But with an aging population, over time,
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.180]   that'll mean that there will actually
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:41.580]   be a little bit less demand for very safe assets, which
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:45.260]   has been a significant boost to fixed income markets,
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.380]   as well as the lower rate of inflation.
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.700]   We had a research report on what are the investment
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.260]   implications of an aging world and a world
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.980]   with slower demographic patterns.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.980]   And what we did conclude was that it is modestly
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.700]   inflationary, but those sort of headwinds
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.980]   don't really come into play until roughly 10 years from now.
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.940]   Demographics is a-- there's competing forces.
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.380]   There's some things that can be positive
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.860]   to the financial markets, bonds or stocks from demographics.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.980]   There's other things that can be potentially negative.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.460]   But these are slow moving effects.
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.900]   And so it's important to say, over what horizon
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:24.780]   may they matter?
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.780]   And also to appreciate the other forces,
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.540]   because demographics are far from the only one that
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.340]   are affecting an economy and financial market
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.540]   at any period of time.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.780]   I'm going to lump these next three questions into one.
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:44.100]   It has to do with your forecast for Fed cuts, number one.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.100]   And secondly, do we get to a point
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.660]   where rates are so low that we're pushing on a string,
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.620]   another old saying on Wall Street?
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.300]   Has the Fed's hammer been taken away
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.500]   because interest rates get so low?
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.100]   And then finally, what are the prospects for the US
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.100]   to hit negative interest rates like we
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.260]   see in a lot of the other developed markets?
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:11.940]   Yeah, let me take the last one first, Rick.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.380]   I think the odds of us seeing negative interest
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.180]   rates in the United States are very low and much lower
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.540]   than other countries.
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.060]   I wouldn't assign a probability to any outcome zero.
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:23.940]   That would be foolish.
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.820]   But I think there's a number of reasons
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.660]   why we won't see negative in the United States.
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.460]   I think one of the reasons is the importance
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.140]   of short-term funding markets, including money market
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.220]   funds, which is really a strength and diversified
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.260]   source of funding for corporations
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.100]   and lending for short-term collateral.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.020]   And so there's both technical as well as
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.260]   fundamental reasons why I think the Federal Reserve will
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.980]   be reluctant to test negative interest rates.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.500]   And I am not a fan of negative interest rates.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.300]   I'm more in the minority in my profession.
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.100]   I can't prove this, but I think history
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.180]   will show that the modest negative interest
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.020]   rates we see in both Japan and in Europe are a mistake.
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.500]   And we have not seen significant lift
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.980]   from either of those economies with negative interest rates.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:11.180]   Now, again, I'm not expecting a move from zero interest rate
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.980]   to negative 0.25%.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.420]   It's going to lead to fundamental growth, right?
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.060]   That would be an unfair criticism.
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:22.180]   But I think the risk that negative interest rates play
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.420]   and why I think we won't ultimately see them in the US
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.220]   is that there is a risk that when a country sets negative
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.340]   interest rates, that you can actually
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.900]   lead some investors to start to believe that we'll
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.780]   have deflation, meaning falling prices,
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.620]   or to lower their inflation expectations, which
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:42.220]   is precisely the opposite outcome of the rationale
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.900]   for taking interest rates below zero to begin with.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.940]   Yeah, unattended consequences.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.100]   Unattended consequences.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.140]   So I don't have proof in that, but I
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.580]   think there is now at least some doubt in some central banker's
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:54.060]   mind.
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.540]   And so I don't think we'll see it.
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.660]   I think in the next recession, what we will very likely see,
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.780]   though, is the Federal Reserve cut interest rates
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.900]   to zero much more quickly than they
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.980]   may have done in the past, in large part
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.140]   because they don't have as much room to cut.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.860]   And then secondly, although, again, it
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.500]   may only be modest effects, but I
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.140]   think we will see potentially expansion of the balance sheet.
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.140]   And then thirdly, what will gain much more discussion
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:23.540]   will be the pairing of monetary policy with fiscal policy
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:24.940]   in terms of stimulus.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.780]   This will ultimately become a politically charged issue,
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:31.460]   and my job is to assess the economic ramifications of this.
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.940]   I do believe central bankers, generally speaking,
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.300]   are already pushing on a string.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.860]   I don't think the Federal Reserve should
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.860]   be pushing on the string.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.700]   They are trying to, at the end of the day,
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:47.780]   maintain full employment and to get inflation actually higher
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.780]   than where it is.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.020]   So the risk is, in our outlook, and one
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.380]   of the reasons why we think the next move by the Fed
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:58.180]   will likely be a cut and not a hike,
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.300]   even though I personally wouldn't do it
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.620]   if I was on the Fed, is likely because they
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.380]   want to make sure that investors still believe there
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.380]   will be positive inflation in the future,
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.540]   and they want to continue the expansion as long as possible.
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:15.500]   And again, those points are part of their mandate and charge,
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.980]   but we can all, I think, disagree about whether or not
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.260]   they should be cutting or not.
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.380]   We've debated that internally here at Vanguard.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.140]   But I've sat in the middle of debates,
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.380]   and I've actually argued from both sides, which you probably--
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.260]   would surprise you as an economist.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.100]   I use both hands, but at the end of the day,
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.780]   also my job is to assess, certainly
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.020]   for the portfolio management teams, not what they should do,
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.260]   but what ultimately the Federal Reserve and others
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.500]   will do, because that has the bearing
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.180]   on the financial markets.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.940]   And so I think the bar is high for the Federal Reserve
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.500]   to cut the rates in 2020, but I think
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.060]   they're more likely to cut them than they
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.100]   are to raise them if our assessment of where
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.340]   the economy may unfold and inflation may unfold this year
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.260]   is right.
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:01.580]   It seems as though everyone hangs on every word
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.260]   the Fed says.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.460]   I think the central banks get too much attention
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.260]   in the financial markets, because they don't control
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.460]   long-term interest rates and the stock market as much as,
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.460]   I think, people think they do.
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.580]   It seems like that the day of an announcement,
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.980]   but they really don't influence it as much as they think.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:25.580]   But I think the risk is they focus so much
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.860]   on preserving the expansion for so long
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.740]   that they may under-appreciate some of the financial froth
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.620]   that is building in the system.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.340]   And so that's what I worry about,
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.180]   and that's what I think one of the unintended consequences
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.660]   could be.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.260]   Let's talk a little more about inflation.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.380]   And if we define inflation by the prices
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.340]   we pay for all the goods or services
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:54.180]   we purchase as consumers, in fact,
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.140]   one of the most perplexing questions in economics,
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.100]   and hence in the financial markets,
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.820]   Rick, is actually why inflation has been stubbornly
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.660]   so low for so long.
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.620]   Almost any central bank without exception in the world
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:13.620]   aims to have inflation average roughly 2%,
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:17.100]   and then they try to calibrate their short-term interest
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.220]   rates, which they clearly control,
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.860]   to try to hit that target, knowing that it's a moving
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.660]   target, and they're trying to hit it.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.220]   For all the golfers out there, they're
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.300]   100 yards from the hole, right?
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.980]   That's where they want inflation to be, on the green,
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.500]   knowing that they'll never get a hole in one, but close enough.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:40.860]   Could you explain why do central bankers want inflation?
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:46.220]   Yeah, it's actually a really good question.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.660]   Why any inflation at all?
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:52.700]   The reason why, generally speaking,
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.940]   most economists would argue that you want a stable inflation
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.620]   rate that's modest, but positive, is for two things.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.740]   One is the belief that if you have
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.740]   a stable and expected inflation rate,
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.460]   that it makes it easier for planning purposes.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:12.980]   And so you're more likely to have modestly higher investment,
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.420]   hiring, and then consumption.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.960]   And there's some truth to that, right?
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.660]   Because if you can have better foresight on the increases
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.900]   in prices and so forth, that reduces uncertainty.
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.540]   We all know the higher uncertainty, the lower, say,
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.620]   investment or spending loss equal.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:32.820]   But the big reason why is because in any economy,
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.820]   you have debt holders, right?
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:38.180]   So if you're a consumer, many of the listeners out there,
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:42.100]   myself included, my highest debt right now
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.540]   is the mortgage payment, which has a fixed term.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.260]   And it's in fixed dollar amount.
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:50.860]   Why central banks want a positive inflation rate
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:55.020]   is if you had a consistently negative inflation rate,
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.540]   say negative 3%, negative 4%, and you have a fixed debt
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:03.580]   level, that makes paying back that debt that much harder.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:07.140]   Because your income is falling by 3% or 4%, right?
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.900]   But I think what economists do a poor job in saying
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:13.140]   is when they say it's bad to have deflation, what
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.060]   they should say, and what I should say,
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:20.380]   is that it's bad to have wage deflation.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.540]   Because if we see sales at the store,
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:28.740]   and that TV one's buying is 20% off, and so forth,
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.580]   that's not necessarily alarming.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.140]   It's alarming when you have all prices going down,
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:37.260]   including the prices for our labor, meaning
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.260]   our wages or our income, and our salaries going down.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.820]   That's what happened in the early 1930s, which
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.780]   led to massive defaults, particularly
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.700]   among farmers and many companies.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.900]   It froze consumer spending, because I
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.520]   don't think anyone's going to maintain
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.380]   their same level of consumption if their own income is not
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.020]   only falling, but expected to fall further.
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.220]   And we've seen glimpses of how pernicious
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:07.380]   this can be on and off in Japan for the past 20 years, right?
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:12.420]   Because the bond market today, even in Japan in surveys,
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.220]   very few Japanese consumers expect inflation
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.660]   to be positive in the next five or 10 years.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:21.020]   And their wages don't go up by a significant amount.
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.060]   And so that's where, at the end of the day-- so behind,
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:27.340]   when you hear the Federal Reserve is targeting 2%,
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:30.220]   and everyone talks about the Consumer Price Index,
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:33.580]   where that 2% came from, all the way back from Milton Friedman,
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.740]   who won the Nobel Prize, and even before that,
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:41.700]   it's really around this fear of avoiding wage deflation,
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.340]   particularly that we saw during the Great Depression.
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:49.380]   I recall when we had a negative inflation rate, just
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.980]   a very minor negative inflation rate a few years ago
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.820]   after the financial crisis.
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.820]   There was a big question on the minds of Social Security
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.340]   recipients were, are they going to cut my Social Security
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.500]   benefits, which I think would have created riots in Washington
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.000]   DC.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.980]   But imagine that-- and imagine that in an environment.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.020]   That's a great point.
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.900]   Imagine that, then, not just for those that are Social Security
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.020]   beneficiaries.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.780]   Imagine if everyone had the concern that their paycheck
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.580]   was going to fall.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.980]   Yeah, we actually had this in the United States on and off
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:26.060]   in almost every economic crisis in the 19th century.
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:29.220]   Many workers' wages were set by the day,
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.900]   and so you had a lot of recessions.
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.820]   This is long before the Federal Reserve was created.
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:34.780]   This is 19th century.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:36.440]   You had financial panics and so forth,
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:41.300]   and you would have unemployment rates go up by 10% or 20%,
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.500]   and there's a very short time.
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.300]   And you'd have very deep, even if they were short,
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.140]   you'd have very deep downturns, a very volatile period.
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.060]   One of the reasons for that is you
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.140]   would have wages that were falling significantly
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.580]   for periods of time in many cities in the United States,
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:58.620]   on the eastern seaboard.
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.700]   And I know that because that's why I did my dissertation on it.
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.620]   And so that is ingrained in central bank theory, which
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:06.540]   I think could be--
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.180]   hopefully, we don't experience too much,
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.260]   but it actually could be the irony of negative interest
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.140]   rates going forward, is that at that margin,
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.860]   if that pushes down inflation expectations,
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.940]   that's the very outcome that they're trying to--
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.980]   so hard to avoid.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.740]   Let's get back to the global economy and talking about how
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:26.180]   this glut of manufacturing capacity overseas
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.940]   is affecting growth, probably worldwide and also here
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.260]   in the United States.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.380]   And what is going on in Germany?
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.460]   What is going on in Japan?
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.860]   What's going on in China?
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:37.020]   What's going on in the UK?
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.960]   And talk about Brexit and this whole global package
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.860]   that I'm asking you to talk about.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:46.700]   The broadest stroke is that the global economy is still
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:52.180]   expanding, but growth is uneven, and it's fragile right now.
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.940]   One of the underappreciated reasons
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.820]   we believe and we talk about in The Outlook
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.340]   is the high level of policy uncertainty.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.220]   Now, again, for those listeners, there's
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.500]   always uncertainty in the world and in life.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.900]   But there's times when policy uncertainty-- you just
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.620]   mentioned one with Brexit.
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.500]   It's Brexit.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.780]   It's US-China trade tensions.
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:15.140]   It is other trade tensions with other countries,
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.140]   between two countries all across the world.
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.140]   And then there's actually increased
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.860]   political disagreement between and among political parties
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.980]   in almost every country around the world.
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.180]   There is strong statistical evidence,
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.500]   including what we have done, that when
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.580]   you have those high levels of uncertainty,
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.460]   you will tend to see a lower investment
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.140]   than you would otherwise, which I
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.900]   think makes intuitive sense.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.580]   And that's one of the things that I
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:43.820]   think we see going on, that we saw a drastic increase
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:46.740]   in policy uncertainty, not just in the United States,
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.220]   but we clearly saw it in China.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:52.260]   And one of the reasons for this cyclical slowdown
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.380]   that we're still working through this year, Rick,
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:56.740]   and so that's still working through the system.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.820]   And Germany has a very high exposure
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.580]   to manufacturing, particularly to the China consumer.
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.220]   And it was the slowdown and the deterioration
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.740]   in private sector confidence in China,
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.260]   sometimes which is not widely reported,
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.140]   which led to a significant slowdown there,
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:17.580]   which I think also increased the odds more recently that we
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:18.940]   saw a phase one trade deal.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:23.020]   Because I think Chinese policymakers were
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:24.580]   battling on several fronts.
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.540]   And so they were increasingly concerned that they
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.740]   were going to have growth much weaker than expected.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:32.740]   And so they were, I think, a little bit more willing
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.540]   to at least have a phase one deal than what
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.940]   it would have been otherwise the case a few months prior.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:41.460]   So I'd hang some of it, not all of it, on uncertainty.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.140]   Because it's by these measures that we
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.220]   track, which are based upon news reports
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:48.100]   and other statistical measures to measure and quantify
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.300]   uncertainty, which can seem ephemeral and tough to put
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.260]   your hands on, they're the highest
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.940]   that they've been in over 30 years.
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.660]   It's not surprising that it is at least stunting or hampering
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.580]   some investment.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.740]   It isn't hampering the US consumer,
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:07.740]   because he or she is still chugging along fairly well.
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.340]   But it has been a reason why we've
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:13.740]   been mixed signals on the global economic front.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:19.700]   So let me just go over quickly your forecast for US equities,
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.020]   non-US equities, and fixed income.
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.700]   So we all have a general framework
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.700]   to work from before I get to the questions from the Bogle heads.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:32.340]   Your expectations or your forecast
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:39.020]   is over the next 10 years for US equities to give nominally--
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.100]   that means with inflation included--
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:45.300]   3.5% to 5.5% annualized.
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:51.220]   Non-US, you're a little bit more optimistic, 6.5% to 8.5%.
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.380]   And I want to get back to that in a minute.
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:58.060]   And then fixed income, 2% to 3%, which
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:01.980]   means that a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds, 60/40,
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:07.380]   somewhere between 4% and 6%, and call the midpoint about 5%.
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:12.060]   But let's get back to the non-US, 6.5% to 8.5%.
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:15.340]   Is that because valuations are lower?
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.980]   Is this, by the way, dollar-adjusted,
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:18.580]   meaning is this in US dollars?
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.820]   So the dollar is going to contract?
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.980]   Yeah, it's in US dollars.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.420]   There is a currency effect.
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:30.220]   But the primary reason why the expected range of returns
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:33.900]   are better than the US is, to your point,
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.900]   Rick, it is valuation-based, which is, again,
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.460]   another great reason.
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.420]   You don't need this reason for a globally diversified portfolio.
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:43.380]   But certainly, the US markets have just
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.380]   outperformed every other part of the world.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.500]   In fact, the S&P 500 index has arguably
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.340]   outperformed any investment, public or private,
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.740]   any part of the world.
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:55.660]   It's been that strong, which has been great.
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.580]   But it's also why the expected returns are among the lowest.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.700]   So I'd say three broad points on our outlook
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:02.820]   for the financial markets.
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.500]   One is the principles of asset allocation
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.020]   will stand, even in a lower return environment,
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.740]   because over the next 5 to 10 years,
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:14.260]   it is much more likely than not that a diversified stock
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:16.940]   portfolio will outperform bonds.
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:22.020]   And a diversified bond portfolio will outperform a money market,
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.260]   which is good to hear.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:28.060]   Rarely would you see those expectations not be that.
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.700]   It would have to be in a bubble-like environment, where
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:34.500]   you could actually reasonably generate other expectations.
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.860]   But we don't have them.
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:39.140]   Secondly is that a globally diversified portfolio
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.860]   should outperform the US over the next 5 or 10 years.
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.540]   Finance theory tells us, almost by definition,
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.060]   that a globally diversified portfolio is, quote unquote,
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.140]   "more optimal" than a US-only portfolio,
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.220]   because you use diversified company
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.940]   risk across multiple markets, right?
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.460]   And you at least double the number of securities.
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:00.220]   So the global portfolio is always the most efficient one
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.140]   on the frontier.
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.460]   Over the next 5 or 10 years, that's
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:05.980]   where a valuation comes in.
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.340]   And that should be a little bit more of a tailwind
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:12.100]   for the European, other developed markets, and even
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.420]   parts of the emerging markets.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:17.540]   So now again, the US has outperformed the non-US
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.060]   over the past several years.
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.140]   It's more likely than not, where valuations are,
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.740]   that that will happen.
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:27.020]   And so we use valuations in how we model.
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.780]   That's the sort of simulation engines behind the scene
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.700]   that we then show those results in the paper.
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.100]   We are the first to acknowledge, we project ranges of returns,
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.380]   because our models are good, but they're far from infallible,
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.540]   and they have error in them.
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.180]   But I can tell you, our framework--
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.180]   we've published it in the academic community--
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.980]   our framework is generally twice as
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.860]   more accurate for long-range forecasting, twice more
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.460]   accurate than either the historical average, which
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.500]   is what I think that most investors have generally used.
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.000]   If you don't have any other method,
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.140]   you just use the historical average.
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:02.640]   It's twice more accurate than that,
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.460]   and twice more accurate than some of the popular ones
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:09.180]   that Bob Shiller made famous at Yale, part of the reason why
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.260]   he won the Nobel Prize.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.380]   So we use those valuation approaches
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:16.340]   to inform the investors of what those expected returns are.
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.260]   So they're lower than historical average.
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.540]   We compare those returns versus, say,
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.100]   the average return since 1980.
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:26.820]   I don't think we need any mathematical framework, Rick,
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.660]   to tell us that the future returns will be lower
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.060]   than they were since 1980, because since 1980, we've
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:36.580]   had, I think, the best financial market
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:40.300]   performance in the United States that has ever been seen,
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.340]   and could very well ever be seen,
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.140]   at least for the next 100 years.
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:45.580]   Certainly in our lifetime.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.700]   I mean, it's been a great run.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:52.220]   Sometimes I don't wish I would be back in 1980, 1982,
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.160]   but it was a great time.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.620]   It didn't feel like it at the time,
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.740]   but we had double-digit interest rates,
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:02.460]   and we had P/E ratios of below 10.
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.620]   I mean, I think the 10-year treasury was even higher
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.460]   than the P/E ratio.
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:10.580]   And since that time, we all know interest rates have come down.
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.940]   The economy has expanded, and valuation multiples
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:13.980]   have actually increased.
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:17.940]   And so what a great starting point
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:22.340]   that has effectively run its course,
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:26.220]   which has led to double-digit average returns for not just
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:30.140]   all equity portfolios, but even 80/20 portfolios,
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:33.140]   and at times, 60/40 portfolios.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.140]   So that doesn't mean the outlook is somber.
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:37.460]   It's just more of like going forward.
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.100]   It's a little bit-- it's certainly below the recent--
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.220]   it's clearly below the recent historical average.
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:44.900]   And that's almost regardless of whether we
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:48.300]   have stronger or weaker economic growth this year coming.
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.540]   Yeah, I always look at the DuPont formula,
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:54.100]   if you recall from your days of study you had.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.260]   I mean, what are the three levers of return on equity?
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.740]   It is your operating leverage.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:02.540]   It's your financial leverage.
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.260]   And it's your taxes.
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.420]   And what that basically means is operating leverage
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.860]   is how much you actually get as a rate of return
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.500]   on the product that you're selling.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.580]   But financial leverage is lowering of interest rates.
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:17.940]   As interest rates come down, you get a bump in return on equity
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.300]   because your financing costs are low.
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:21.860]   And then as your taxes come down,
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.940]   you get a bump in return on equity
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:25.380]   because your taxes are lower.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.420]   Well, we can't get too much lower on interest rates.
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.740]   We can't get too much lower on corporate tax rates.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.420]   I mean, the only thing we have left
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:37.300]   is the operating leverage, which is productivity
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.420]   through technology.
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:42.060]   And as we talked about before, population growth--
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.140]   and that's at least the population growth side--
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.380]   is beginning to decline.
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.260]   So I look forward and I say, well,
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:51.180]   where can the earnings growth come from over the next 10
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:51.940]   or 15 years?
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.940]   It's not going to come from your lowering of interest rates.
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:58.260]   It's not going to come from lowering tax rates.
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.100]   And baby boomers are retiring.
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.700]   And we have slower population growth.
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.500]   So where does it come from?
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.140]   The one area that it could come from
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:06.660]   is the area that's actually arguably
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:08.420]   the most important for long-term growth.
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.980]   And that's innovation.
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.260]   Economists call it productivity.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.780]   But think of the rate of innovation.
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:13.860]   How much more efficient?
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.020]   New product, services, business lines, right?
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:19.220]   It's new technologies like the internet coming in.
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.740]   That's what I call pure oxygen. I mean,
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:24.740]   why innovation can be beautiful in that sense
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.300]   is that you get higher operating leverage, meaning ROI.
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.980]   Natural, right?
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.620]   It's generally non-inflationary.
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.700]   So it's market-friendly.
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.740]   That can lead to higher inflation-adjusted rates.
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:38.420]   So that's good for bond investors, right?
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:42.420]   Because it generally adds to the risk-free rate for all asset
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.380]   expected returns.
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.020]   And then clearly that can be positive
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.500]   for equities and companies.
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.220]   So that's one of the reasons why we have low growth.
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:50.420]   Yes, it's demographics.
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:53.460]   But the bigger disappointment has been productivity growth.
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.300]   And that's worldwide, which is why some have argued
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.660]   this notion of stagnation.
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:02.140]   Ultimately, innovation, I strongly believe, will return.
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:05.020]   And we have a report coming out in the next few weeks
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.860]   talking about the future of innovation
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.020]   based upon a lot of deep research we've done.
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.020]   That's encouraging.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.260]   It probably won't show up in 2020.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:16.700]   But longer term, I'm less pessimistic when
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:19.740]   I look out 10 years than some, knowing that the world has
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:21.940]   challenges, to be sure.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:25.500]   I think on our more muted return outlook,
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.940]   ironically, there's two broad things for this.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:31.460]   Because I talk to financial market reporters.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.300]   And they're thinking about it from the active management side.
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:36.140]   Or they'll say, then, OK, well, what's
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:39.820]   the best asset class to invest in if it's lower returns?
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.860]   Which is not really, I think, the right way
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:42.860]   to think about it.
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:45.460]   I think what this is is all the more reason
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.860]   for this to stay the course and staying fully invested.
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.940]   Because if it's a lower return environment,
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.180]   that means that we have to have our money at work
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:56.940]   in our portfolio every day of the week, right?
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:58.260]   Because returns are lumpy.
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:00.260]   And it's tough to know when the stock market will
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.420]   go up any day, week, or month.
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:06.180]   And then, secondly, that's where the planning and focusing
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:09.300]   on the costs and just the diversification--
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.180]   I call those free lunches of the portfolio.
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.100]   They're going to be that much more important.
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:16.500]   Now, I know that your listeners appreciate this.
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.780]   But I think we're going to have to--
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:21.420]   I think to be a service to others that are not,
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.500]   I would ask, at least we turn up our volume on this a little bit.
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:28.340]   Because I think it may not be as important to someone
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:31.220]   of lower cost or diversification when you get a--
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:34.180]   almost any portfolio gives you 10% return.
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:37.860]   I think it matters much more to our friends and family
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.980]   if we're talking about expected returns of 4% or 5%.
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.900]   Because the margin for error is just lower.
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:43.460]   Much lower.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:46.420]   So it doesn't mean we can't overcome it.
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.300]   It's the bond arithmetic that's really going to, I think,
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:52.860]   hurt equity markets not as shiny as it was, too.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.100]   But that just means I think we just
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:56.540]   have to grit our teeth a little bit
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:59.380]   and focus on those fundamentals.
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:00.580]   When you talk to some--
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.980]   not on this podcast, Rick, but we talk to some, right?
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.300]   It doesn't sound as exciting, right?
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.620]   You go on the TV and you say, oh, you're
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.020]   just going to have to save a little bit more
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.780]   and stick to the fundamentals.
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.620]   They look at you as like, really?
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:13.460]   There's not a secret panacea on this?
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:14.860]   When you don't like the forecast,
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.060]   you just go find a new economist.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:17.580]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:19.580]   Well, there's no silver bullet on that, right?
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.700]   There is no silver bullet.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:25.780]   Do you have a recommended international stock allocation
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:29.220]   for your typical bogelhead investor?
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.620]   I mean, I would personally start any investor
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:35.500]   at 40% non-US equity exposure.
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.500]   And this is something that we actually
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.620]   do in our advice units.
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:43.700]   It's also the default non-US equity exposure
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.540]   in our target date funds.
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.980]   That is consistent across Vanguard.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.900]   And so that's where I would start.
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:53.380]   It's not a fully market cap.
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:57.260]   The non-US market, it's a little bit higher percentage.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.780]   But I think how I generally approach
[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:01.780]   it is by following that 40%.
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:05.300]   You start there, and then if you have less comfort or more
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:06.980]   comfort, deviating from that.
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:10.980]   But I think if you can start there, that's an important--
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:14.540]   and because that really reduces the volatility of the portfolio.
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.140]   That's the so-called, quote, unquote,
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.420]   if there's a sweet spot, quote, unquote.
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:21.380]   You have the lowest standard deviation in returns
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:22.820]   when you have that mix.
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.540]   The returns differentials between the US and non-US
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.700]   will bounce around in a year.
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.340]   They have, and they will continue to.
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:31.620]   But the volatility of that portfolio
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:34.580]   is generally lowest when you're at that point.
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:38.860]   An area that you're negative on is less quality or lower
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.180]   quality corporate bonds.
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:44.740]   I know that your research does influence some of the more
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:47.660]   active Vanguard funds.
[00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.340]   Are they going to be taking this and shifting?
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:53.780]   I know you can't say they will do it.
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:57.220]   But will they use this data to possibly shift out
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:01.300]   of an area where you're not really hot on,
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:04.620]   which is the amount of BBB-rated bonds that
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:07.420]   are in the corporate bond side?
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.180]   Yeah, well, for those investors that
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:14.060]   have some of our actively managed bond funds--
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.860]   and again, our bond funds, almost all of them
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:19.100]   are managed internally by our fixed income group.
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.260]   So I have the great pleasure of sitting
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:24.220]   on what we call the hub.
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.060]   But it's a senior investment committee
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.700]   for all the actively managed bond funds.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.940]   I don't chair that committee.
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:32.300]   That's the global head of fixed income, John Hollyer.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:35.020]   And there are several of us on that committee.
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:37.300]   And we take these sort of discussions
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:38.860]   that you and I are having today, Rick,
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:41.660]   and we take that into consideration
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.460]   of building the most viable and what
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:48.180]   we think is appropriate bond strategy for the investor
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:48.740]   in that fund.
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.180]   Now, again, those funds have hundreds
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.500]   of funds that's supported by a deep team of credit analysts
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.660]   and portfolio managers.
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.140]   Over time, they add a lot of value
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.260]   by picking the right bond over another bond,
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:04.700]   what we would call idiosyncratic risk or alpha.
[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.540]   What we're primarily trying to do
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:10.740]   is just make sure that the portfolio is optimally
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.660]   structured so that if we like corporate bonds,
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:15.820]   generally speaking, because the economy doesn't
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.660]   look like it will fall in recession,
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:20.980]   we're trying to pair that with interest rate diversification
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:22.180]   should we get weakness.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:24.300]   And so we would generally be, say, long duration.
[00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.700]   You'd actually be overweight treasuries
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:28.300]   if you're overweight corporate bonds.
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:30.820]   And so, yes, this is reflected.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:33.740]   But it's not just solely like, OK, we think growth is higher.
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:34.660]   We'll take more risk.
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:37.700]   We do this in terms of how we assess the distribution
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:40.020]   of, say, economic growth or inflation.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.980]   We always do it relative to what we assess the market is already
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:45.420]   anticipating.
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:47.860]   And that's what I think is often lost by,
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.780]   at least when you watch certain shows,
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.660]   you read certain press reports.
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:54.620]   Because I think there's this assumption that, I don't know,
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:58.460]   higher growth or higher inflation means a direct--
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:01.100]   well, one should do directly something to the portfolio.
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:02.540]   What I think is lost sometimes is
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:04.940]   that the financial markets may be already
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:08.740]   pricing in a weaker or stronger than that scenario.
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.460]   And a great example right now is the stock market,
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:15.380]   which by our calculus is already assuming GDP for 2020
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:19.060]   will be 3%, let alone 2%.
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.940]   And so if one says, oh, we're bullish on the US economy,
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:23.820]   we're 2%, 2 and 1/2%, that may not
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.420]   mean that in some of these active strategies
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:28.020]   that we would modestly take more risk.
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:30.780]   It's all relative to what the market is already pricing in.
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:32.020]   So hopefully that's helpful.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:32.540]   It is.
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:33.180]   Thank you.
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.980]   One last question, because this seems
[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:37.420]   to be an emerging issue when it has
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:42.380]   to do with climate change, ESG, this type of strategy.
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:46.460]   Are you seeing that having any effect on the markets'
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:51.020]   valuations, where people are putting their money?
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:54.660]   I've seen clearly interest from advisors,
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:58.860]   from individual investors, some institutions in particular,
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:03.900]   just on environmentally sensitive investing,
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.620]   ESG-type strategies or SRI strategies,
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.220]   socially responsible investing.
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.500]   There's clearly more interest.
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:13.580]   Right now, I'd say more of the interest is on what is it,
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.860]   because there's different types of those approaches.
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:18.700]   You can either screen and not own
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:22.180]   certain securities versus maybe be more proactive
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:25.920]   and owns certain companies outright.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.540]   So we're seeing more interest in that.
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:29.700]   And we've obviously launched certain products
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.180]   that are consistent with those approaches.
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:34.660]   Time will tell how widespread they become
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:37.580]   in terms of investment dollars.
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.140]   So I have heard the interest.
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:41.980]   I think the academic research community is starting
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:44.520]   to focus on it more in the economic space.
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:47.380]   So I'd say more to come on that.
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:49.420]   It's something I could see us doing a little bit more
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:51.840]   deeper research going forward.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.340]   - Joe, it's been a real pleasure to have you
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.980]   on the "Bogleheads on Investing" podcast.
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:57.420]   I hope we could maybe make this an annual event.
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.980]   - That would be great, that would be great,
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:00.940]   if you'll have me, yeah.
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:02.020]   - Oh, definitely.
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.240]   - Oh, and for everyone, happy new year
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.340]   and best of luck in 2020.
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:08.540]   - This concludes the 17th episode
