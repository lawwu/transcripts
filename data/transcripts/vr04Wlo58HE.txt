[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.980]   Amusing Ourselves to Death.
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.200]   That was the great title to a book written by Neil Postman
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.200]   and published in 1985, Amusing Ourselves to Death.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.120]   Maybe you've heard of it or even read it.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.680]   It's a great title.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.920]   It was a great title before the digital age
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.320]   and it's a great title for the digital age
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.880]   and I'm gonna borrow that title for this episode
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.280]   with one change.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.080]   Amusing Ourselves from Death.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.400]   Today's theme in a clip from a John Piper sermon
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.520]   preached in the summer of 1996.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.520]   And before we get into it,
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.240]   here's a little context for the sermon
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.120]   and why eternal realities were especially on the forefront
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.120]   of Pastor John's mind at the time.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.560]   Evangelist Billy Graham was in Minneapolis
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.520]   for a five-night rally.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.900]   By then, Graham was, I think, 77 years old or so.
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.440]   He spoke for a week in the Metrodome,
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.320]   which was just steps away from Bethlehem Baptist Church.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.800]   It was a huge gathering, well-attended.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.360]   Local reports put attendance for the final evening
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.940]   right around 100,000 people in attendance.
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.840]   All of that was happening the same week
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.200]   as this sermon from John Piper
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.220]   and it's why he'll mention the dome in a little bit.
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.360]   With that, here's Pastor John in June of 1996.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.320]   - Death is sad
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.840]   and death is terrifying
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.840]   if there's a holy, just God
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.520]   who's gonna call everybody to account.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.560]   If you don't believe in God, if there is no God,
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.360]   and death is simply the end of a long summer,
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.320]   it's just sad.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.600]   It's sad.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600]   The reason it's sad is because life, as we know it,
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.280]   in this world, is the basis of everything
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.480]   that makes us happy, family, friends,
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.480]   leisure, food, sex, job, work, meaning.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.800]   If you don't have life, you got none of that
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.680]   and to lose that feels sad, but it doesn't feel terrifying.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.520]   It's not terrifying to fall asleep thinking,
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.380]   you never wake up, it's over.
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.760]   No consciousness ever again.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.740]   That's not terrifying.
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.040]   It's sad to lose things that you know,
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.040]   but it's not terrifying to go to sleep
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.320]   and never wake up again.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.880]   Zero consciousness.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.800]   But if there's a holy, just God of truth
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.460]   who has a law, who has a glory,
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.680]   and we will one day give an account to that God
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.360]   and we will render good or evil
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.920]   for everything good or evil we've ever done
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.200]   or he will render that to us,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   then death is terrifying if we're not right with God.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.420]   The existence of God in relationship to death
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.760]   is a terrifying thing.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.100]   This text says it's a slave master
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.620]   if you're afraid of death.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.440]   And it says in verse 14 that everybody
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.520]   has been held in bondage all their life long
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.000]   by the fear of death.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And I thought about that.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.540]   A lot of people would deny that.
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.700]   A lot of people who don't believe in God
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.640]   would say, we're not afraid.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.840]   We are not living a life of bondage.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.000]   I mean, look at us.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.280]   Do we look like we're in bondage?
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.200]   We're the freest of all people,
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.140]   doing what we want to do.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.720]   What in the world do you mean
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.480]   that everybody is held in slavery and bondage
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.480]   by the fear of death?
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.240]   I don't even, what are you talking about?
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.840]   Where's this verse coming from?
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.560]   Here's what I think it is implying.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.960]   I think even people who don't believe in God
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.280]   and who on the surface are not feeling terrified
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.240]   are subconsciously ruled by the fear of death
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.600]   one way or the other.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.200]   It's a silent slave master.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.280]   One of its main forms of slavery
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.840]   is by putting you in the dream world of denial.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.880]   Now you don't experience it this way,
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.000]   but the way you can tell if you're in it or not
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.720]   is by what you are willing to think about much.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.760]   Denial of the death that terrifies,
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.760]   manifests itself in all kinds of ways of escaping
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.480]   from having to think long or much
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.600]   about your mortality and about your death.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.320]   It's one thing that Americans
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.280]   will not let themselves think long about
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.360]   and therefore we surround ourselves
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.920]   with all kinds of distractions and narcotics
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.920]   to escape from what we know we'd be afraid of
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.840]   if we thought about it
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.120]   and therefore it is ruling us from underneath.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.280]   I thought of this analogy,
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.040]   it's like the cruise control on our station wagon
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.800]   doesn't work, but I know what cruise controls are for.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.160]   The fear of death is like a cruise control in the soul
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.920]   and it is set roughly at 55 miles an hour
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.600]   of contentment and ease.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.880]   Now, if something begins to happen in your life
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.920]   where your life begins to slow down
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.920]   to a pace of pensiveness and reflection
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.320]   and thoughtfulness and big reality
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.360]   start to come into your consciousness
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.480]   and you start to ask some big significant questions,
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.720]   that cruise control is gonna bump that baby
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.080]   back up to 55 in a big hurry
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.320]   so that you don't have to get into thinking about
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.560]   and dealing with those big thoughts that you can have
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.720]   when your life slows down to a restful pace,
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.840]   it's late at night, it's quiet,
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.040]   the stars are out, the kids are asleep
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.400]   and you start to ask the big questions.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.280]   The fear of death, not even consciously,
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.760]   said, quick, turn it on, turn it on,
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.640]   get the volume up, get moving, start doing something.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.160]   Can't deal with that, that's what,
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.040]   then it works the other way.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.680]   Sometimes God in his common graces
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.800]   and we've all experienced this,
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.200]   moves into your heart and begins to rev up
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   your inquisitive motor and you start to inquire and think
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.920]   and it's a kind of a new day and you buy books
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.440]   and you pursue and you wanna know how to solve mysteries
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.200]   and it's not the same reflective atmosphere
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.640]   that I was talking about a minute ago,
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.640]   it's energy, it's inquiry, it's pursuit
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.640]   because there's something vital out there you know
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.400]   and at that 65, 75 mile an hour,
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.560]   you might in fact find it and so,
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.840]   the cruise control takes the foot off the accelerator,
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.360]   brings you back down to the ease and comfort of 55,
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.760]   the TV's just right, the leisure is just right,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.040]   the family's just right, the work is just right
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.120]   and you don't need to ask any of those questions
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.080]   or make any of that pursuit.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.080]   This is what I think the writer here means when he says,
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.320]   "We are being held in bondage all our life long
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.200]   "by the fear of death."
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.160]   There's a slavery, everybody who does not come to terms
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.160]   in reality with God, with sin, with guilt,
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.080]   with punishment, with death and with hell.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.160]   If you don't come to term with those realities,
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.760]   you must be in denial.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.320]   You must be living a life governed subconsciously
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.520]   or perhaps consciously.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.400]   Some of you know what it's like to live
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.120]   in horrible anxieties consciously all the time.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.800]   So whether subconsciously or consciously,
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   this Romans 2.13, 2.15 says that the law of God
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.680]   is written on every human heart,
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.720]   your conscience bearing witness with that law,
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.280]   either condemning or affirming.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.520]   So that I, on the authority of the Bible
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.560]   that Billy Graham holds up,
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.320]   and he seems to get a lot of approval,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.920]   that same Bible says everybody in this room,
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.480]   everybody that will go to the dome tonight
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.320]   or has been there, has the law of God
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:58.040]   written across your heart and it is damning you
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.120]   or affirming you according to whether
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.040]   you are right with God.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.040]   And if you're not right with God,
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.040]   that law written there is going to make you a slave
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.400]   to the fear of death.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.240]   Sobering.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.400]   Yeah, the distracted heart,
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.600]   the heart distracted away from eternity
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.680]   is a perennial problem, a problem as old
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.960]   as the parable of the four soils.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.040]   And this clip was taken from John Piper's sermon
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.800]   preached on June 23rd, 1996, titled
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.400]   Jesus is able to help those who are tempted.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   You can find the whole message at desiringgod.org.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.720]   Well, we have talked on the podcast about Satan.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.760]   Not a lot, we don't fixate on him,
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.520]   but we do talk about his designs.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.680]   And usually when we do, we look at what Satan cannot do
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.120]   to us, to us Christians.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.200]   But what can he do to us believers?
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.200]   That too is an important topic and it's up next time.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.480]   I'm your host, Timothy Reike,
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.440]   and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.400]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
