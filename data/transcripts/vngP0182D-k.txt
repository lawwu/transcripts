[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   Well, John Piper has written over 50 books. So how does he do it? It's a question I would
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.960]   love to ask you today, Pastor John. I don't know if there's a process that you have articulated
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.960]   in the past or not. I don't recall hearing it. So I'd love to hear about the process
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.840]   you use to write your books. And I doubt I'm alone here. Assuming that every book, every
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.400]   book I'm sure is a little bit different. But what are some common stages that you go through
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.400]   when you write books?
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:44.460]   Okay. I do most of what I do, I think, intuitively without following any regimen learned from
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.000]   a book or from anybody else or that I have formulated in my head. But when people ask
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.400]   me questions like this and I step outside my head and look at me, I do see that I do
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.240]   things. There are processes that recur over and over again, for example, in writing books
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.160]   or writing a poem. So let me talk about the creation of a book, not the creation of a
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.000]   poem. Those are very different creative processes. And we could do poetry at another time if
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.720]   anybody cares about that. Not many people care about poetry these days as much as I
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.760]   do. So I have six steps that I'll mention that I pass through in writing a book. Number
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.040]   one, first, a seed thought or a seed idea is sown in my mind, usually by something I'm
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:42.560]   reading or something I'm hearing either positively because I so much want to dig into that seed
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:51.080]   and flesh it out or negatively that I hear something or I read something I so dislike
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.800]   that I want to give a beautiful alternative view of reality. So that's the seed. For
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.600]   example, the seed thought for The Pleasures of God, the book The Pleasures of God, was
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.960]   while I was reading Henry Scougal's little book, The Life of God and the Soul of Man,
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.760]   when I read this sentence, "The worth and excellency of the soul is to be measured by
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.840]   the object of its love," that was like a lightning bolt into my brain. When I read
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.960]   that, the thought sprang up, "Is that true for God, that the excellency of God's soul
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:36.680]   is to be measured by the object of his love?" Could I present a fresh picture of the worth
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.000]   and excellency of God by focusing on what he loves? And the kind of love that Scougal
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.240]   is talking about is not agape love towards your enemies in spite of how disgusting they
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.040]   are, but it was a delighting, affectionate sense of something you find pleasing. So what
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.960]   does God find pleasing? What does he delight to do? And the book was born. The seed for
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:09.200]   future grace, the book Future Grace, was the thought, "Nobody sins out of duty. We sin
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.600]   because sin makes promises to us. And to the degree that we find those promises compelling
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.120]   and attractive and winsome and desirable, we will sin. So the key to killing sin is
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.120]   severing its root by the power of a superior promise." And the book was born, all 400
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.400]   pages of it, from that reality. Yeah, kill sin by the power of a superior promise because
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.320]   nobody sins out of duty. They sin because they're fully in love with the promise that
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.040]   sin is lying to them about.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.040]   Stage two, step two. They're not all that long. The gathering step. Here, I simply throw
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.320]   things into a big electronic file from all over the place. Just gather and gather and
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.920]   gather and just throw it in there because it's amazing what you can do with search engines
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.120]   in Microsoft Word and find your stuff and organize it. So I'm not worrying about any
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.740]   kind of sequence or order. I'm just throwing stuff in a file. This is gathering, filling
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:17.040]   up a barn with all kinds of hay. For example, when I wrote "What Jesus Demands from the
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.200]   World," the seed thought was Matthew 28, 20, which says that we are to teach the nations
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.660]   to observe everything Jesus commanded. And I thought, "Where's a book that does that,
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:37.080]   that helps a missionary teach his disciples everything Jesus commanded and how to observe
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.920]   it?" So I took several weeks, read through all four Gospels, cut and pasted all the imperatives
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.480]   and all the implied imperatives into one document. Hundreds and hundreds. I think there were
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.480]   about 500 entries in that file. It looked hopelessly daunting. I just stared at it for
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.680]   days thinking, "What in the world will I ever do with this? Everything Jesus commanded
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.160]   is what has been given to us, and we're supposed to teach it to the nations." So that was the
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.440]   gathering step.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.480]   Number three, third step, praying and reading and thinking and doodling on pieces of paper
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.800]   toward a conception of structure. What in the world am I going to do with hundreds and
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.200]   hundreds of imperatives from the Gospel? How will that come into any semblance of order
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.480]   or structure or coherence? How is it to be presented? How will I turn that into a book,
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.760]   a readable, organized, sequential book? And frankly, I think this is, at least for me,
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.400]   the hardest step in writing. And I think it's the step that kills most writing projects
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:54.240]   and kills most writers. It simply looks impossible. It looks too big, too complex, too confused.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:02.000]   And the reason for that is that we are staring at something that doesn't exist. We're staring
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.600]   at something that doesn't exist. It's like a painter staring at a palette of colors—paint
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:15.080]   palette of colors—and a blank sheet of paper with a view to creating a scene. And he hasn't
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.920]   even made up his mind whether it's going to be a scene of an ocean or a mountain or
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.480]   a meadow or an urban scene.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.800]   And after days and days of praying and thinking and doodling on a piece of paper by drawing
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.680]   lines among all the ideas—my papers look ridiculous, they just totally look like messes,
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:40.000]   but they weren't for me—what emerged from the massive material of what Jesus demands
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   from the world is that many of these imperatives fall into groupings. And I wound up structuring
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.520]   the book in 50 short chapters, which are grouped in various groupings so that everything could
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:00.640]   be covered. And all that came from mind-breaking staring, thinking, doodling, and especially
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.960]   praying. I think God has to break through or we just give up.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.200]   Number four, step number four, just start writing anywhere. It may be the middle of
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.540]   the book. It may be the conclusion. It may be the introduction. It may turn out that
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:22.380]   you will throw it away the next day. But many projects go unfinished because writers wait
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.200]   and wait and wait and wait until they have a clear enough conception in their head of
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:33.040]   what they're going to say, at least several pages worth, before they start typing away.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.760]   And that's hopeless. I just would find that utterly hopeless. I generally find that it's
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:45.080]   helpful to write what I'm trying to do in the book. Here's what I'm trying to do.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:56.480]   And as I write, it dramatically, amazingly takes shape in that moment, which I mentioned
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.480]   last.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:06.200]   But number five, as I begin to write, I try to avoid falling into worn-out jargon and
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:13.120]   into familiar ways of saying things. I am always trying to describe and explain glorious
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:19.920]   reality in fresh and compelling ways. Now, here's the last step, and it's the most amazing
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.600]   step to me. Actually, the one that gives me the breakthrough into conception is amazing,
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:32.080]   but this one feels even more amazing to me, a kind of mystery that in the process the
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:44.320]   book takes on a life of its own. I mean, as God enables us, ideas start coming from the
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:53.040]   very writing itself, ideas that we did not have before we began to write. This is the
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:59.480]   most mysterious and wonderful part of the creative process, that the very act of trying
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:07.120]   to make something clear brings deeper and clearer insight into the reality.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:14.040]   This is why it would be a mistake, a deadly mistake, to wait until you have clarity on
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:22.160]   everything before you start writing. The sight comes through the saying, the writing. This
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.440]   is why I can never predict ahead of time how long a book is going to be or how it will
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:34.920]   be organized. Whatever ideas I got at the conceptual stage may be turned upside down.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:42.400]   It's dramatically different as the book takes on a life of its own as I do the writing.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   So that's a glimpse into the six steps that have brought most of my books into being.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.960]   One, the birth of a seed idea. Two, the gathering of lots and lots of material with little care
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:01.800]   to order and sequence. Three, praying and thinking and doodling toward a conceptual
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:10.200]   structure. Four, starting to write anywhere just to get going. Five, aiming at avoiding
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:16.960]   being trite or using worn out jargon, but aiming at fresh, compelling ways of saying
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:24.840]   truth. And number six, watch the book take on a life of its own as the writing itself
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.600]   becomes a way of seeing.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:33.160]   That's an incredible glimpse into your six-stage book writing process. Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.000]   Well speaking of creativity, next week we're going to talk about preaching and all the
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.440]   ways that I think will bless a preacher who listens to the podcast, but also we're going
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.680]   to, I think, bless people who listen to sermons and who have questions about how sermons are
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.800]   made and about questions like how long is too long of a sermon and how short is too
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.520]   short of a sermon. It should be a really interesting week. Three episodes on preaching next week.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.480]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you on the other side of the weekend. See you
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:30.480]   then.
