[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   Today, we're going to be taking a look at Google's new Gemini 2 model.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.240]   Now, Gemini 2, I think it's probably one of the most impressive LM releases out there.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.840]   And although I can't form a full opinion on it quite yet, I still need to work with it a little more.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:29.280]   It does seem to be something that I would actually stop using OpenAI for potentially again, I need to test it more, but it's.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:39.440]   If not that model, it's the closest I think I've ever seen to getting to that point where I'm like, oh, I don't necessarily need OpenAI for a lot of stuff anymore.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.280]   So that is really interesting.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.320]   And one thing I really like that they're doing is they're focusing on the agent's use case.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.080]   I think agents are like short term future of LLMs and AI in general.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.720]   And I mean, their announcement here is literally like it is the new AI model for the agentic era.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.280]   Like they're really focusing on that.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.480]   And one thing I have noticed is that this model produces a structured output very well.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.760]   So we're going to be focusing on the text to image and image to text modalities.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.720]   And we're going to be jumping into this multi-modal example here.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.440]   So this is in the Aurelio Labs cookbook repo, Gen AI, Google AI, Gemini 2, and then multi-modal under here.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.000]   We have a load more Gemini 2 examples coming as well.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.720]   So there'll be more in here very soon.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.160]   Now we're going to be working towards something kind of like this.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:43.440]   And there's probably actually a few other really interesting examples where we're just taking some images that are not necessarily super clear.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.760]   And we're just going to be able to see, you know, what does it do?
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.920]   Where does Gemini 2 not work very well?
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.120]   Where does it work incredibly well?
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.200]   And yeah, we'll see a few of those examples.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.360]   So in that notebook, you will be able to open it in Colab.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.720]   And that's probably the easiest way of like running through alongside me in this example.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.680]   But I'm going to run it locally and you can run it locally as well.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.120]   There's some set up instructions here, but easiest is just Colab.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.000]   So if we're running locally, the first thing we need to do is just select our environment.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.880]   Of course, in Colab, you don't really need to do that.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.080]   So we run this.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.080]   I have these four images here.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.480]   OK, we're going to see them here, actually.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.280]   So we run this.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.880]   OK, so we'll just see each of the four images that we're going to ask for.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.960]   So these are just screen grabs from like some diving videos.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.520]   And, you know, there's like there's a lot going on in here.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.960]   I think, you know, a lot of the examples I've seen from Google are like really clean images.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.400]   So we have these images kind of blurry in a lot of cases, a lot of motion
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.920]   and a lot of noise is just a lot going on in all these pictures.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.520]   So they're not easy images to work with here.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.080]   So we'll see how how Gemini performs against them.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.800]   First thing, we're just going to ask Gemini to describe what is in these images.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.760]   So we're going with the first image where you have like these anemones
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.280]   and then the clownfish or anemone fish in the front here.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.720]   There's a cleaner wrasse or something.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.000]   I'm not entirely sure how you call it.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I think these are table corals.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.560]   Like there's a lot of stuff in this image that we can say, OK, what is in the image?
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.720]   It's also there is also clownfish over there in the background.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.800]   I haven't managed to get Gemini to label that one.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.080]   Probably it won't again.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.400]   But we'll see. See how things go.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.800]   Interestingly, running this notebook today compared to yesterday,
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.720]   the results change quite significantly.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.640]   I'm not sure if I just got lucky one time, but the results seem a lot better.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.200]   So I think maybe Google or maybe they're doing something.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.240]   I don't know. Anyway.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:13.320]   So first thing, we are going to need a Google AI Studio API key.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.080]   And OK, we get that from Google AI Studio.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.800]   So I'm going to go and open that.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.200]   Right. So you will need to just go and create an account.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.520]   So you create an account and then you just go through.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.880]   And where is I think maybe settings API plan information.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.040]   You come into here and then you want to go to you and open this up.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.840]   So this is just going to open a window in GCP.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.480]   And basically GCP generates this project for you, Gemini API.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.920]   You can go ahead and just create a credential here.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.120]   I think. OK, so we'll ask you API key.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.080]   This is the one you want.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.960]   So just click API key.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.440]   You get your API key and you just want to paste it into.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.200]   This should a little box should pop up or you just pop it straight into a string.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.080]   Here. It's up to you.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.680]   I'm going to go ahead and do that right.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.960]   And that will just initialize the connection to your client.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.680]   All right. So fairly straightforward.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.080]   Nothing, nothing complicated so far.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.960]   OK, we're going to be using this Gemini to flash.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.600]   The XP here is experimental.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.560]   Again, as I said, it's not really intended to be used in production.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.000]   I'm not sure if they allow you to at the moment.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.880]   I haven't read too much into that.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.800]   But yes, experimental.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.160]   So the actual sort of production ready model will hopefully come soon.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.040]   Although Google are very slow with that sort of thing.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.040]   So who knows?
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.840]   But anyway, so we have the the flash model.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.480]   So it should be pretty fast.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.120]   And where this is basically how we're using the API
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.600]   or how we're using the the model.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.320]   So we are generating the content.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.120]   Right. So we have content.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.400]   And these here basically, at least the way that I understand this,
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.920]   this here is going to be like both of these independently,
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.920]   I believe, are being transformed into user messages.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.080]   This is a text based user message.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.600]   And this is a user message with just an image.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.360]   It could be wrong then, wrong there.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.680]   Maybe they both get combined.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.720]   I'm not super sure.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.120]   But yeah, we have both those.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.760]   We haven't set a system prompt.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.360]   Oh, sorry. Did we?
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.720]   Oh, no, we did set a system prompt. Sorry.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.840]   So the system prompt we defined here.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.360]   OK, so we define this config object here.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.240]   And we pass in our system instruction or system prompt in there.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.960]   All right. So the system prompt is just describe what you see in this image,
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.320]   identify any fish or coral species in the image
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.200]   and tell us how many of each you can see.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.600]   Right. Fairly simple.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.400]   We set the safe settings, which are basically just
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.320]   don't be too straight.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.440]   It's kind of what we're doing here.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.280]   I don't think we really need this, to be honest, for this.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.600]   Maybe they're just fish, but who knows?
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.800]   Then also, yeah, temperature is pretty low, 0.1.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.240]   I did find that it tends to.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.400]   At least for this task, a slightly higher than zero
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.480]   temperature setting seem to actually get better results, which is interesting.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.760]   So usually I would not expect that for a task
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.160]   where the agent needs to produce such structured output.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.880]   OK, so, yeah, we have that.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.440]   So we pass that to our model.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.200]   Then we pass in those contents.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.120]   So the one thing with Gemini 2 is I will generally output everything
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.640]   in Markdown without you even telling it to, which is fine.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.840]   I like Markdown.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.840]   So I'm just basically showing everything in Markdown here.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.040]   So we have the overall scene.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.160]   It's describing it as an underwater scene, coral reef,
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.280]   marine life, coral formations, it's daytime, natural light
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.000]   filtering through the water.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.560]   So that's pretty accurate, I think.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.960]   They have the clownfish, right?
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.080]   So this is an interesting thing.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.240]   So when I'm asking it to describe the scene,
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.760]   it actually seems to identify things very well.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.000]   But then when you're asking it to draw the bounding box, it doesn't.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.240]   Or at least before it wasn't quite doing as well.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.360]   So we have the clownfish.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.320]   There's two clownfish it didn't notice, the one in the back.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.640]   All right. The one over here.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.440]   So interesting.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.880]   And then there's this wrasse.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.320]   So I don't know how you pronounce it, by the way,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.440]   but I think it's wrasse.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.320]   So this wrasse, it's this little thing on the left here,
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.400]   which is pretty tiny.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.680]   I think also, if you haven't been diving much,
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.320]   you probably wouldn't even notice this fish.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.960]   The only reason you notice, like, if you've been diving a little bit,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.520]   it's because they'll try and kind of bite you and stuff
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.080]   and just be generally annoying.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.920]   So that fish is just kind of like ingrained in your memory.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.560]   So kind of cool that it identified that.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.960]   You have the coral species, the anemone,
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.120]   which is what the clownfish live in.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.800]   You have the hard corals, branching corals,
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.280]   plate corals, and some massive corals.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.480]   But that's kind of cool.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.920]   And then there's some counts.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.880]   All right. So, yeah, that's pretty cool.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.960]   So that is just describing an image, right?
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.040]   So image to text or text to text and image to text.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.400]   Now, what we want to do is we're going to draw these bounding boxes.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:40.360]   And so this prompt here, it's mostly adapted from an example
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.760]   that Google provided where they're doing the same thing, right?
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.000]   They're drawing the bounding boxes.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.680]   And what I found is, like, modifying this much
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.240]   or tended to break it pretty easily, which is interesting.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.160]   So I don't know if that's just a prompting thing.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.880]   Maybe I need to get a little better at prompting this model.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:05.080]   So, anyway, we're telling it to just return some bounding boxes, OK?
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.440]   And they do that as a JSON array with labels.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.840]   Now, this seems to be something it's being pre-trained on,
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.480]   as far as I can tell,
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.800]   because I'm not really defining much here.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:23.160]   And it is, if you come down, oh, I don't have the example.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.400]   But it's producing this structure,
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.480]   which is exactly the structure that we need, essentially.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.040]   So it's obviously -- it's had a few examples of this
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.520]   in the training or fine-tuning datasets.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.280]   So we're just saying bounding boxes.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.560]   One thing I'm doing here, if an object --
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.640]   I don't specify fish, but --
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.720]   because I also want to just kind of keep it flexible.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.800]   If an object is present multiple times,
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.760]   label them according to their scientific and popular name.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.960]   And so my first question with this new prompt --
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   so this is our new system prompt.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.240]   My first question is highlight different fish in this image.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:08.720]   And you're seeing here, like, the runtime is super long, right?
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:14.600]   And the reason for that is that Gemini is repeating itself
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.840]   right now a lot, and I don't know why that is.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.520]   I think, you know, beyond the example,
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.360]   like the really simple examples, it does tend to do this.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.120]   So we'll see, and we'll fix it.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.080]   But, yeah, you get all of these, which is kind of crazy.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.280]   There's so much going on there.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.880]   I actually didn't look at what the output of this would look like.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.000]   And to be honest, I'm not sure we can --
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.680]   or not easily, because it cuts off just here.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.760]   It just stops. So interesting.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.200]   But it does seem to be getting -- like, the labels here are --
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.280]   you know, they are things that are in there for the most part.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.920]   Of course, unknown fish is just -- but, yeah, I don't know.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.200]   It's kind of interesting that it just repeats a ton of stuff there.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.400]   But, anyway, we can resolve that, and it's super easy to.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.880]   All I did was add a pretty high-frequency penalty here,
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.520]   and that resolved the issue.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.040]   I was also playing around with the temperature.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.760]   Like, you can increase or decrease this.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.080]   It doesn't make too much of a difference.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.000]   And then, yeah, I mean, the only other thing is, okay,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.480]   we have a limit to 25 objects,
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.520]   but we had that before, and it didn't listen very well.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.840]   So, actually, I didn't even modify anything here, right?
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.440]   This is still the same prompt.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.520]   So all I've done is added the frequency penalty, right?
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.840]   So interesting. Now let's see what it does.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.240]   Okay. We have this, right?
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.640]   It's actually labeling a lot more stuff than it was before,
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.880]   which is interesting.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.160]   Let's see how -- well, we'll see in a moment how all of that looks.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.880]   But, okay, we have this JSON output.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.480]   That's what we need.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.960]   And, yeah, you can see this is --
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.080]   like, Gem92 has obviously been trained to do this.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.520]   We have our bounding pops.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.840]   You have the -- these are the coordinates in some order.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.600]   We'll see in a moment what they actually are.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.320]   And then we have a label, right?
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.080]   Kind of interesting that it got a different clownfish.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.000]   Anemonefish and clownfish are the same, as far as I know.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.240]   So interesting they identified a different one to what it did before.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.600]   Before, it was usually going with clarks, clownfish for both.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:30.800]   Okay. So what we need to do is sometimes this will also output a message, right?
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:36.680]   So it might have some text, and then it outputs this JSON here, right?
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:42.600]   And it's probably worth me just showing you what that, you know,
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.400]   text actually looks like, because it's not --
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.520]   you know, we're formatting it with mark down here, right?
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.240]   So what it actually looks like is this.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.880]   So to extract out our JSON,
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.920]   we're just going to be looking for this, like, code block.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.520]   And we extract out whatever is in the middle.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.720]   And we do that with regex here, like a simple regex.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.280]   So we're just looking, okay, we're looking for this and this, right?
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.040]   And anything in between.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:20.640]   So we're looking, yeah, first line of the JSON, final line of the JSON,
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.440]   and we grab everything in between.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.440]   Okay? Yeah, that's it.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:29.240]   So we do that, we extract that out, and then we just load it with JSON.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.440]   And then we get this, right?
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.880]   So it's just a dictionary -- sorry, a list of dictionary objects
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.880]   with all of our coordinates and the labels.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:43.240]   Then, okay, this is just wrapping what we did just up here
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.640]   into a parse JSON function, just to make things a little easier.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.400]   Then what we're going to do is plot the bounding boxes, right?
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.480]   So there are a few things going on here.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.360]   Most of this is pulled from one of Google's examples
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.280]   where they have a similar setup.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.560]   And basically what we're doing is --
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.240]   okay, here we're just saying we pull out a few different colors
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.520]   or color names so that we can use them when drawing our bounding boxes.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.920]   So we have, like, colorful bounding boxes, essentially.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.480]   We don't necessarily need to do that, but we do here.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.840]   It is easier when you're trying to read everything, I think.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.400]   We take the image, right, we're passing it into here,
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.920]   but we're making a copy of it
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.720]   because otherwise we would modify the original image
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.320]   when we're adding those bounding boxes,
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.680]   which is super annoying if you run it more than once.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.400]   Then we're just taking the width and height of the image,
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.320]   which we need for the normalization set below here.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.920]   We initialize a drawing object.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.640]   So this is part of the pillow library.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.320]   Basically, we take that, the picture,
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.720]   and we're going to draw on top of it.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.760]   That's what this draw image will allow us to do.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.080]   Extract our bounding boxes from the LLM output.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.240]   And then for each bounding box,
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:04.480]   we're going to go through and, like, well, draw them
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.720]   on our, like, draw object.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.000]   Let's run this and see what it gives us.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.360]   Nice. Okay, so actually when you do look at this,
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.640]   it identified quite a few different fish,
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.160]   but I think they're all actually pretty accurate, right?
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.600]   This is pretty good.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.200]   So you have the clownfish or two clownfish here.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.280]   It identifies them as different species,
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.880]   but they're definitely the same.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.240]   It does pick up on the clownfish in the background
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.200]   just as it identifies a clownfish.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.920]   Then I think that those two are actually other fish.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.800]   I think maybe there's fish here, but I can hardly even --
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.800]   Yeah, there are. I think there's some there,
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.200]   but I can hardly see that.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.880]   For some reason, none of the models
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.040]   seem to be able to identify this fish in the corner here,
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.520]   maybe because it's partly cut off,
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.680]   and it does identify the urassa, which is cool.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.080]   Now, this one's harder, I think,
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.920]   to identify the different corals.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.880]   Sometimes this kind of gets some of them okay,
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.320]   and then other times it just kind of goes off the rails.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.960]   So, yeah, we can see.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.560]   All right, so here, yeah, you can kind of see.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.400]   I mean, there's just a lot of stuff going on there.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:26.400]   So what it's saying here is that this is an equidopora coral.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.440]   We can see it here. Let me -- All right, this thing here.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.480]   Equidopora, right?
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.520]   So, yeah, I mean, I think those things are kind of everywhere,
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.120]   if it is what I think it is,
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.800]   and I wouldn't say necessarily got any of them here.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.040]   Maybe, like, over here or here they could be, but, yeah.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.640]   So it's just kind of saying
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.160]   that there's loads of that everywhere, which is interesting.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.320]   I wouldn't say it's necessarily accurate.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.920]   This one, I have no idea.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.440]   Not bad.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.640]   Actually, that's correct.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.080]   I thought it was just anemone.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.400]   Okay, so I thought this was called,
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.160]   like, giant anemone or something.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.640]   So, yeah, it got the anemone correct,
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.480]   I think, in some places here, right?
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:22.240]   So it's saying the anemone is, like, this one here,
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.040]   so kind of covering the clownfish,
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.160]   and also here, so it's interesting.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.320]   I think probably because clownfish live in the anemones,
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.360]   so I wonder if it's seeing the clownfish,
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.200]   seeing some corals around it, and it's like,
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.800]   okay, yeah, it's definitely an anemone, right?
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.280]   Because it's weird that the rest of them around here
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.760]   doesn't identify as that,
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.880]   but then when there's a clownfish next to it, it does.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.200]   So that's kind of cool. Again, not perfect, though, right?
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.960]   But honestly, like, a few more models down the line,
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.760]   this would be pretty impressive.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.480]   So I'm asking specifically for the clownfish,
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.520]   and it actually got the one in the background this time.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.800]   This is the first time.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.320]   Like, every other time, it didn't get this.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.920]   So that is really very cool.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.640]   I think Google are actually doing something with the model.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.800]   Like, at the moment, they're definitely modifying it
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.880]   because I'm getting, like, gradually better results
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.440]   every time, I swear.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.120]   So, yeah, it does.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:26.480]   So it says that this is the Clark's clownfish,
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.280]   and this one is the other one, the,
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.600]   what did they call it, like, ocean something?
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.000]   I'm not entirely sure.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.920]   So I think this one is wrong, but that one over there,
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.520]   I don't, I'm not entirely sure.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.440]   I don't know what they all look like.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.160]   Maybe we can have a quick look.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.800]   Not bad. I don't think it is this one, though,
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.440]   but it does kind of look like it in this picture.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.680]   It kind of looks like that,
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.360]   but I think it's just another one of these
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.760]   without the other stripe,
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.760]   or maybe it's a juvenile or something.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.680]   I'm not sure.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:03.480]   Let's just check if those are the correct one.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.280]   That looks right to me.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.840]   If it's not right, I mean, it's close.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.800]   So that's cool. Very exciting.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.480]   And then, so I was really having issues
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.000]   with identifying the clean arrests over here.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.480]   I don't know if that's how you pronounce it again,
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.800]   but it just would not,
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.840]   Gemini could not seem to identify the rest.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:31.160]   So let's see if it manages, and it kind of does maybe.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:38.560]   What is this? So let's see what that is.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.200]   Oh, amazing.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.800]   Google is up to something.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.320]   Or should I say DeepMind?
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:52.480]   Anyway, so that is pretty cool.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.280]   I was happy with the results anyway.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.600]   I thought it was just amazing.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.680]   But that being said, I'm just super happy
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.960]   that the results are better
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.800]   since when I tested this less than 24 hours ago.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.080]   So that is just wonderful.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.200]   Okay, moving on to the next example.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.360]   So another image.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.640]   This one, oh, this one it didn't get last time as well,
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.520]   and I tried so many times, and they have it this time.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:25.920]   So weirdly, when I ran this last time,
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.720]   so this big one in the middle is SomethingSweetLips, I think.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.000]   They have interesting names for all the fish.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.880]   So this is a SomethingSweetLips.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.320]   I can't remember exactly.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.480]   And you can see, well, you probably can't
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.680]   because this text is really small,
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.880]   but that here says SweetLips.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:50.400]   So it actually did get it, which is just cool.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.960]   Before, it was not even identifying it as a fish.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.200]   It was pulling in all the fish from the background,
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.320]   but not this one, which I found super weird.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:05.280]   So that is amazing that it actually got it now.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.840]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.560]   I even wrote it doesn't catch a very large fish in the middle.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.280]   Now it does.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.520]   Well done.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.440]   Yeah, I love this sort of thing.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:29.880]   Yeah, nice, PaintedSweetLips, that was it.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.200]   So PaintedSweetLips, I don't know,
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.280]   because they all have different patterns and stuff,
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.240]   and I don't know if this is-- it's definitely the type of fish,
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.120]   but is it right with the pattern?
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.480]   I don't know, to be honest.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.680]   But if you look, there was one picture
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.080]   where it looked pretty similar.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.040]   Also, this is maybe a yellow-banded SweetLips
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.640]   rather than the painted SweetLips.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:59.960]   But honestly, it's not bad.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.640]   Come on.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.800]   Yeah, so it would be a yellow-banded SweetLips
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.120]   instead.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.840]   Really very cool.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.160]   I'm impressed with that.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.600]   So yeah, and then I was like, oh, come on.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.880]   Give me-- tell me what that big fish is in the middle.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.800]   I mean, it already got it, so I think it's fine.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.480]   Yeah, he got it.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.800]   But cool that it doesn't identify the other fish
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.160]   in the background now.
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.880]   That is pretty exciting.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.360]   Cool.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.600]   So that's good.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.040]   We're going to move on to the next picture.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.960]   There's just a couple more here.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.160]   Every now and again, this does happen.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.360]   So it's not perfect.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.760]   But I mean, I was thinking, OK, if you're
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.960]   going to do tool calling and stuff--
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.720]   I haven't tried tool calling yet.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.360]   I'm not even sure if you can.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.520]   I didn't see anything super obvious on how to yet.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.640]   But if you're going to do tool calling,
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.400]   that would kind of resolve the issue.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.120]   But anyway, so yeah, this is pretty good.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.160]   It's identifying a ton of different fish
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.200]   all over the place.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.360]   I don't know what they all are.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.880]   But these are all just--
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.920]   they're kind of fish that you--
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.960]   I don't think most divers would even know.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.920]   I don't know.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.200]   But it does identify these black ones over here.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.880]   So this is a nasolitoratus.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.360]   So we can have a look at what that is.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.640]   So I mean, you kind of look at this and like, oh, no.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.920]   It's not the same fish.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.800]   But it's actually-- I think it is relatively close
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.040]   or related in some way.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.000]   Because if you look at the fin, they
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.920]   have this weird fin where it's like a--
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   I don't know what it is.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.840]   But they have that very distinct shape.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:42.400]   And if you look here, you can't really see it very well.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.440]   Maybe if I just go and take the image itself,
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.320]   you might be able to see a little better.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.840]   You can kind of see--
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.640]   not very well, but this fish here
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.560]   does have that sort of weird tail shape
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.800]   where it's like it sits up.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:01.660]   And then it has a little two streams at either end.
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.720]   So potentially accurate.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.280]   The front of it looks kind of similar.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.560]   I don't know.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.520]   But it seems like it's at least related.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.000]   I don't know if it is the exact same fish.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.960]   But that's pretty cool.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.360]   Now, OK, not bad.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.320]   Then, oh, yeah, the corals.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.680]   Let's see how it is with corals.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.640]   Because there's a lot of corals in this.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.880]   I have no idea what most of those are or any of--
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.400]   I don't think I know what any of them are, to be honest.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.220]   But yeah, let's see what it comes up with.
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.460]   Nice, so a ton of things here.
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.700]   So I think some of these--
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.860]   so the brain coral kind of doesn't look really like that.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.100]   It actually looks more kind of brainy.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.740]   Staghorn coral, I think, is correct for this thing,
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.940]   or at least close to this thing down here.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:55.740]   So if we look at a picture, kind of similar.
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.340]   If it's not that, it looks pretty similar to--
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.760]   probably, to be honest, it probably isn't that, actually.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.440]   No, look at it.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.220]   But it's pretty similar, anyway.
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.680]   Now, you have the brain-- let me just
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.960]   show you what a brain coral looks like,
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.320]   because it doesn't really look like that, I don't think.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.600]   So it's different.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.560]   It's big, like those other blobs that it's pointing out.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.000]   But it doesn't look quite like this.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.680]   So I would say no for that, in my opinion.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.920]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:29.980]   Then we have-- yeah, staghorn, staghorn, brain.
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.780]   Yeah, it needs-- yeah, I think that's all it identified here.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.380]   So generally, wrong.
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.580]   But at least it identified--
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.940]   mostly identified the actual fish, which is kind of cool.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.380]   OK, not bad.
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.820]   It identified a few fishes, corals.
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.420]   I think it's pretty hard, to be honest.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.340]   But not bad, I don't think.
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.340]   Then, finally, one more picture.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:27:02.740]   So this picture, if I just pull it up before we label it,
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.820]   so it's actually to the side, the picture.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.100]   So the ground would be down here.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.580]   And up here is the surface.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:18.860]   And this is a big ship turret, like a sunken ship turret.
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.740]   And there is a fish that lives in here.
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.380]   And you can put a--
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.900]   the fish keeps his home clean.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.500]   So if you put something in there, the fish will grab it.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.420]   And he'll throw it out, because he
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.860]   wants to keep his home clean, which is kind of cool.
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.460]   So it's kind of hidden, right?
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.540]   It's hidden inside there.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.820]   So I just want to see if Gem and I can actually identify that.
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.780]   And let's see.
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:48.480]   Interesting.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.860]   So it's-- I think that was an error.
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.520]   It was running for a long time as well.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.860]   So maybe it started repeating.
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.420]   I didn't-- I haven't had that before.
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.380]   That's the first time I've had it break on that example
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.420]   after setting the frequency penalty.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.980]   And I was actually quite impressed
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.980]   by how many fish it pointed out.
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.380]   There's a lot of fish just in the background.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:17.260]   You can't really see them, like this one here or these.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.360]   And it managed to identify them, which
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.640]   I thought was pretty cool.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.400]   And I think this is also a--
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.980]   I think it's at least a damselfish.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.520]   I don't know if it's exactly what this is.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.520]   We can have a quick look.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.480]   But it got the hidden fish, which is cool.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:38.100]   So that is a Malucan damselfish.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:38.600]   Yes.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.920]   So the different colors here, but it's basically
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.680]   a black version of one of these.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.760]   I don't know.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.360]   I mean, at least to me, it looks--
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.540]   it's basically the same as these things here.
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.940]   So even if I just go damselfish, yeah,
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.440]   you can even see, like, there's a picture in the middle here.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.680]   Or it's just like a black one.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.000]   But I think they're the same.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.680]   It seems pretty similar to me, size-wise, for sure.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.600]   So yeah, I mean, that was that.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.080]   And then-- oh, yeah, I just want to--
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.240]   so another thing is, OK, this is kind of a different picture.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.880]   It's not just, like, fish and corals.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.120]   It's actually-- it's a shipwreck.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.160]   So can Gemini identify this as a shipwreck?
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.040]   So I've just explained--
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.800]   I've modified the system instructions
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.400]   to not do the whole bounding box thing.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.120]   And said, OK, describe what you see in this image.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.520]   Identify fish or coral species in the image.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.200]   And tell us how many of each you can see.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.920]   So I'm not even saying anything about, OK, look,
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.760]   there's something.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.360]   There's, like, a shipwreck or anything.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.400]   I'm just saying what is in this image.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.720]   And then I've just said, OK, explain what this image
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.200]   contains, what's happening, and what is the location.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.820]   I wanted to see if it could give, like,
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.200]   a super accurate location, but it didn't, of course.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.440]   I did try and push for it.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.720]   So there's a large cylindrical object
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.080]   with a hole in the center.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.760]   It appears to be made of metal, and it's
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.120]   covered in marine growth, so on and so on.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.880]   It is likely this is part of a shipwreck,
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.760]   and the cylindrical object could be a gun barrel, which
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.680]   is kind of cool.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.280]   So you got that right.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.760]   Subtropical, tropical, subtropical.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.240]   One fish inside the hole, that's kind of cool.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.960]   Then I just wanted to see if it would, like,
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.000]   guess a specific place.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.360]   I knew it probably wouldn't, but who knows.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.440]   A section of a shipwreck.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.320]   Basically, it just kind of refuses to answer my question.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:45.160]   But that's fine, it did well there, I think.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.640]   Maybe if we gave it access to Google Search,
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.840]   it might actually be able to.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.040]   But yeah, I would be impressed.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.840]   Anyway, that's it.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.280]   So that is our example.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.000]   I mean, it does pretty well, in my opinion.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:05.160]   Just, you know, like, as a first test, I am pretty impressed.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.760]   I think it's cool.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:11.360]   I think the structured output abilities of the model,
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.680]   even without tool calling here, pretty impressive.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.840]   Of course, it has been fine to output this structure,
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.920]   I think, as well, which helps.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.600]   But I'm pretty optimistic.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.360]   I'm optimistic that this model might do very well as an agent.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.600]   And that's mostly what, at least for me,
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.280]   it's mostly what I'm building with almost all the time,
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.680]   like building agents.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:39.160]   So I think it could be pretty big, in my opinion.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.040]   Especially compared to all the other models
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.480]   I've sort of tested over the years.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.280]   Like, OK, every time OpenAI comes out with a new model,
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.280]   that's pretty big.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.200]   But then the others just don't really
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.560]   match up in terms of agentic ability all that much.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.720]   Or they have some weaknesses that really just kind of stop
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.320]   you from implementing actual use cases.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:04.160]   So this one from Google, maybe--
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.960]   let's see-- maybe that model, that finally
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.880]   gets a good portion of people to move away from OpenAI
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.600]   and start actually exploring these other models, which
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.760]   could be pretty cool.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.680]   So yeah, that's it for this video.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.340]   I hope this has all been useful and interesting.
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.720]   But for now, I'll leave it there.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.160]   So thank you very much for watching.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.160]   And I will see you again in the next one.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:27.760]   Bye.
