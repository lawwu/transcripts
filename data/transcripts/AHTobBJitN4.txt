[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.200]   We have a question now from Dami, who asks, "Doesn't doing problems on the go, as you
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.200]   recommend in How to Become a Straight-A Student, incur a cognitive burden?"
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.680]   This listener goes on to say, "I'm entering my junior year in college in Ireland, and
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.480]   I was wondering if the advice that you give to take your problem sheets with you on the
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.080]   go just makes you a "grind on wheels"?"
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.080]   Thanks.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.680]   Well, I appreciate the opportunity to go back and talk briefly about How to Become a Straight-A
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.680]   Student.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.720]   My second book I ever wrote came out in 2006.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.920]   I wrote it primarily as an undergraduate/first-year grad student.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.000]   Interesting aside about that book, it's the best-selling of my student books.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.960]   I stopped really paying attention to that, but for whatever reason, when my agent sent
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.000]   me my royalty statements earlier this week, I was like, "Hey, how is that book doing?"
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.240]   It turns out How to Become a Straight-A Student has sold now more than 200,000 copies since
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.680]   it came out in 2006, never with a big marketing push, never on a best-seller list.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.460]   It just sits there, and we just sell every week.
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.460]   People buy it.
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.460]   It's been there forever.
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.960]   I'm surprised that someone hasn't come and usurped it because the concept was very simple.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.680]   I said, "What if you just wrote a book about how to study in college that took the question
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.720]   seriously and did nothing but just give advice?"
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.920]   Say, "Okay, I talked to 50 students who get good grades without burning out.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.760]   Here's how they do it," and just be very technical.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.280]   That was the whole concept.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.600]   Treat students with respect, give them the information.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.760]   That book, man, that just rolls along, just rolls along and crushed it.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.200]   How to Win a College, I checked that.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.360]   It's now crossed healthily past the 100,000 copies sold, and How to Become a High School
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.440]   Superstar is catching up.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.680]   I think it's at 60,000.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.760]   There's this secret underground world of those student books I wrote as a young man that
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.280]   are continuing to do some damage out there.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.040]   All right, so let me just really briefly tackle your question.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.240]   I talk about, I guess in that book, and, Dami, I am mixing up that book with blog posts I
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.600]   wrote immediately after that book came out.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.000]   To me, these are kind of the same thing.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.140]   The original point of my Study Hacks blog when I started it right after Straight A Student
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.840]   came out was basically to add extra chapters that did not show up in the book.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.880]   It was just continuing the conversation that was that book, so I mixed these things up.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.800]   I don't know if it was in the book or on my blog back then.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.480]   I would talk about bringing with you these, you call them problem sheets.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.000]   These were probably the mega problem sets I talk about in the book, but basically sample
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.640]   problems, which is at the core of how I suggest in that book studying for technical classes
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.640]   or mathematical classes.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.200]   I talk about these are portable.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.800]   You can bring them with you to study.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.760]   You're asking, "Will that make you a grind on wheels?"
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.000]   Well, no, because my recommendation is not, "Okay, when you build these study guides,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.680]   study with them all the time."
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.680]   That's not what I'm saying.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.000]   I wasn't saying, "Now you want to do 30 hours of studying, and because you have these sheets,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.840]   you can study much more than you could before."
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.840]   That's not what I'm saying.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.560]   In fact, the core idea in how to become a straight-A student was the equation.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.280]   Studying accomplished equals time spent times intensity of focus.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.680]   The whole idea in that book is if you get your intensity of focus higher, you can reduce
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.600]   the time spent required to get the same amount of work done.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.740]   The real advantage of having portable study materials is that you can go to locations
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.300]   that are going to juice up that intensity of focus.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:49.480]   You can go to the deepest, darkest, most concentration-inducing stacks of a faraway library.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.440]   Shout out to Dana Biomedical Library on the Dartmouth College campus where I used to do
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.440]   this studying.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.660]   It means you can go into the woods and hike for 20 minutes and sit without distraction
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.440]   by a waterfall to think nothing but about your problems.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.140]   It means, like one student I wrote about on my blog back then, you can find a way to sneak
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.340]   onto the roof of the physics building and study by light with the stars above you.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.480]   So the advantage of having portable material is that you can seek out the places that will
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.280]   reduce the total amount of time you have to study, not that you can now do more studying.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.240]   I'm all about figuring out what work needs to be done.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.600]   Why am I doing the studying this way?
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.760]   Is this the fastest way, the best technique, or am I just spinning my wheels?
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.200]   And when do I want to do this work?
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.960]   You make that plan, you execute.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.900]   That's the key to getting good grades without burning out.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.360]   And that's what I recommend in that book.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.040]   That's what I recommend on those early blog posts.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.680]   So that is what I will continue to recommend now.
