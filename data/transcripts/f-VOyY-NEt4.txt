[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   I love your book, "Relax Into Stretch."
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.640]   I think it's a really important concept, this idea that the nervous system and our mental
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.120]   state is preventing, inhibiting a good amount of our natural flexibility, and that we can
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.100]   work with the mental state and progressive relaxation and contraction of muscles and
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.400]   related tissues.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.400]   We absolutely can.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.920]   And it's very much mind over the matter.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.480]   I have a great success story.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.080]   So one of my senior instructors, a strong first, Steve Freedis, so I met him a couple
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.500]   decades ago, and he had a severe back injury.
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.040]   So he spent eight or nine months in bed in Percocet, and he was not athletic.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.080]   He'd done some jogging or things like that in the past.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.140]   And he decided to get serious about getting strong.
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.560]   So he healed up until he was healthy.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.840]   He started lifting kettlebells, then after that he started powerlifting, and he started
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.520]   doing proper stretching like this.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.580]   So he is, right now he is, Steve is in his late 60s.
[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.920]   He holds a bunch of American Masters records in the deadlift, even though his back was
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.320]   totally messed up.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.640]   Lifts without a belt.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.000]   He is, you can break your fist on his abs.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.200]   I like having people punch, "Would you please punch, Steve?
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.540]   Just don't hurt yourself."
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.860]   But he also worked up to suspended side splits, and you know, at that point he was probably
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.180]   in his 50s when he did that, and maybe 60s possibly.
[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.120]   And then he even competed in this crazy all-around meets where there's one lift where you hang
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.740]   between two chairs, and then you pick up a dumbbell from the ground.
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.060]   You can find the footage somewhere on the internet.
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.580]   So here's the man who did not take his injury lying down.
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.060]   So once he was cleared to train, he decided to approach his training with the attitude
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.340]   of a musician, because he's a music professor.
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:03.740]   And in my experience, that people who could become very successful in strength, musicians
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.760]   and martial artists are among the people who can succeed, because they're used to practice
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.760]   for many hours.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.740]   They're used to paying attention to small detail, and they're used to doing whatever
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.280]   other people consider boring over and over.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.220]   So again, here is this 60-something-year-old man with abs you can break your hands on,
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.500]   deadlift records, and full splits.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.580]   That's what a human mind is capable of.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.460]   I love this concept of a practice, or of practice, not of a practice.
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.380]   But instead of training, I always thought training is such a better word than working
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.100]   out, and it probably is, but I think practice is such a better verb than...
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.180]   Training is also good, of course.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.700]   But yeah, practice is... it puts you in the right frame of mind.
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.020]   You imagine the word "workout," like Litterman quote, "He literally worked himself out."
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.940]   I'm very stringent about form, and always have been.
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.460]   And I do want to ask, what are your thoughts on, unless somebody is training for isometric
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.260]   or eccentric-specific training, full range of motion, not just for sake of building strength,
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.220]   but can using a full range of motion also improve flexibility without some dedicated
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.340]   flexibility training?
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.340]   Yes, it can.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.260]   So sarcomeres can grow in length as well.
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.940]   So the contractile part of the muscle, they can grow lengthwise as well.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.460]   It's something that needs to be done carefully and cautiously, of course, and it's not with
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.460]   heavy weights.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.020]   Eventually, it's possible for a person to perform, you know, flexibility feats with
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.380]   heavier weights if it's desirable.
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.100]   But initially, yeah, something go lighter.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.580]   So yes, absolutely, you can, and it's one of the easiest ways to promote flexibility.
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.900]   And flexibility also has very much a neural component as well.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.380]   So part of it, obviously, you know, you're looking at what's happening in the joints,
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.380]   of course.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:58.520]   Part, you're looking at, you know, the length of the tissues too.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.200]   But a lot of it is also the ability to reset the regulation of muscle length and tension.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.860]   So it's like the ability to do a split, for example.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.840]   It's part of it is, yeah, well, if you're provided your hip joints are built for that
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.420]   sort of thing, a lot of it is really in your mind because you're experiencing defensive
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.420]   inhibition.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.300]   You're just afraid you're going to get torn in half.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.500]   So which brings us to a very interesting parallel, as we kept talking about quality and has also
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.660]   talked about that flow channel by Professor Chiksuma, exactly.
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.660]   Thank you.
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.180]   So between boredom and anxiety.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.960]   So when you're trying to do a split, for example, so you see somebody trying to get into that
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.620]   stretch and that person goes, "Oh," sitting there and panicking and being in total pain
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.420]   and nothing good is going to happen.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.500]   You're pretty much just facilitating this pain pathways and you're just learning to
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.940]   hate this exercise.
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.300]   A smarter individual would get to the point to the edge of pain and then stay there for
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.260]   a while and then owning it until the spindles reset, you know, okay, accept the new range
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.460]   of motion, add some contraction, relaxation, contraction, relaxation, you know, isometric
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.160]   stretching, you know, progress, progress even further.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.780]   So in any type of training, forcing the adaptations is not going to work, whether it's flexibility,
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.100]   whether it's strength, whether it's endurance.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.340]   There's time for a very high level of effort, but there's never time for ripping yourself
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.700]   in half, right?
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.220]   There's never time for hurting yourself on purpose.
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.160]   So, but yes, do a long range of motion work to increase range of motion.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:44.040]   For the upper body, I'm obviously very partial towards kettlebells, but one of the great
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.740]   many benefits of kettlebell training, you know, a bow they handle, is the waist design.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.540]   So you press it from here overhead, that offsets center of gravity, helps to pull your arm
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.540]   back.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.300]   So you're just improving the shoulder flexion, you're improving thoracic extension.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.300]   It's so much easier to place yourself in exactly good position and then just stay there.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.180]   So it's very important to stay open to keep that, keep that youthful posture and keep
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.660]   that good, good shoulder function.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.100]   So but yeah, with squats, you can definitely do that just very progressively.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.420]   One warning about squats.
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.980]   If you're going for a parallel squat, like it is in powerlifting, it's parallel defined
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.400]   as the top of the knees a little higher than the crease on the hip.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.100]   Not a right, people will argue about this in some comical ways from time to time.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.560]   So when parallel is not right angle at the knee, correct?
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.960]   It's parallel at the top of the thigh.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.000]   I realize you said it very clearly, but I'm just making sure because debates abound on
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   the internet.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.720]   The top of the thigh should be parallel to the floor.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   Or deeper.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.640]   But when you do go for that depth or somewhere in that ballpark, that's, you can go wide
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.640]   in the stance.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.400]   You can progressively increase the width of the stance if you do it for flexibility.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.280]   There have been people who are doing squats like in almost like a horse stance, stealth
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.760]   squats and progressively developing great level of flexibility.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.880]   It's possible to do that.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.540]   But you're doing that, you're going wider, but not necessarily deeper.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:23.000]   So it's okay to go wider, but you still, your femur should not be dipping too much.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.740]   So if you're trying to go rock bottom in the wide stance, your hip architecture is not
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.740]   designed for that.
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.740]   Right.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.920]   So like Tom Platz, right?
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.320]   Famous for squatting very, very deep.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.240]   But he was narrow, but he used the narrow stance.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.240]   Got it.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.680]   So glutes on calves practically, but he was a shorter guy, right?
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.960]   But he also, he was, but also he was also squatting in a pretty narrow stance.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.000]   So in this particular case, you're not experiencing with the hip, you know, with the hip limitation
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   right there.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   So it's okay for you.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.120]   But imagine if you try to go wider and then you try to go, it's just, again, this is not,
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.120]   not a good idea.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.680]   You could end up on the floor, literally on the floor.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.400]   If you want to develop, here's a great way to develop flexibility for this type of rock
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   bottom squat.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:08.160]   If you're not there yet, initially been without resistance, assume your normal squat stance.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.520]   And I'm talking about a narrow stance, you know, shoulder width or somewhere there.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:18.240]   And approach the wall, face the wall, put your arms out and start squatting.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.440]   And you will find the wall is going to teach you.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.840]   So it is the feedback from the wall.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.080]   If you start doing something funny with your spine, you're going to hit your head on the
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.740]   wall and fall back.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.600]   So it's, it provides terrific feedback.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.480]   It is something that I learned originally from Shikun, a Shikun practitioner.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:43.360]   And again, quite a number of skills that by system are picked up from, from martial arts.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.160]   But we applied that strong first to use that for teaching people that upright squat and
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.600]   developing the, developing the mobility for deep squat.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.680]   It's a, it's a foolproof.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.200]   It's like Greg Cook would call this a self-correcting exercise.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.880]   And those are really the best.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.000]   When the coach can walk away and, you know, have a cigarette and the student is still
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.080]   going to be able to do it right.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:11.080]   [Music]
