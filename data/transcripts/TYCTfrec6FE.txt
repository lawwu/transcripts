[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]   Take Tiablo Canyon.
[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.720]   They built two nuclear reactors here.
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.040]   You know, this site was provisioned for six,
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.720]   for six reactors.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.360]   I could imagine if you had four more reactors sitting here,
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.640]   if you could land them at the right price,
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.680]   you could have one reactor for Meta, one for Amazon,
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.720]   one for Microsoft, one for NVIDIA.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.360]   You could have the data center sitting right next to them.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:39.380]   Bill, man, I couldn't be more excited to be here.
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.540]   We're sitting in, you know,
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.540]   probably your three wood distance from two nuclear reactors
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.240]   that are banging out two and a half gigs of clean power.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.820]   We just had an incredible day with Maureen Zawalnik
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.380]   down here at Diablo Canyon.
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.540]   You know, it's just this beautiful nuclear facility
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.740]   on the central California coast.
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.740]   It's really great to be here.
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.180]   You know, when you look at this facility,
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.460]   you read about the positive impact on the local economy.
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.940]   Of course, it's the type of dense baseload power
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.460]   we so desperately need in California.
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.180]   You know, I think you said on a previous pod,
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.140]   somebody showed up with a value proposition of fission today
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.940]   you know, and blow all of our minds.
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.460]   And here we were about ready to decommission this plant
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.460]   in 2016, which as Elon has said is incredibly brain dead.
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.460]   You know, I was pretty excited to see this week
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.460]   and I was watching ESPN game day.
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.680]   I think it was at Texas A&M.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.360]   And I see somebody holding up a sign, I love nuclear,
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.020]   like college kids are now holding up signs
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.740]   that say, I love nuclear.
[00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.020]   So it's good to finally get down here
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.020]   and put on our analyst hat, dig in, ask a lot of questions.
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.980]   And, you know, be able to share it with everybody.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.500]   - Yeah, and one thing, you know,
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.580]   two things I think that are a little bit different
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.260]   about the podcast we're gonna do today.
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.180]   One, you know, I think it's important to recognize
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.060]   we're obviously not nuclear experts.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.940]   You know, we come at this from outside.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.300]   That being said, the second point I would make is
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.880]   you and I have gone extremely deep in the past week or two
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.100]   and been given phenomenal access to a lot of people
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.580]   that have been in and around the industry for a long time
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.400]   and including getting access today
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.440]   at what is really remarkable.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.460]   I mean, just to see it up close and the scale
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.660]   and how well run it is, it's just super impressive.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.300]   And so I qualify, I'm certain that we're gonna get
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.180]   some feedback from some people,
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.500]   like, why are you guys talking about nuclear?
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.860]   And my only qualification I would offer to everyone is
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.320]   if someone comes at us with something that's different
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.380]   from what we said or that's additive to the discussion,
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.260]   next time we're up, we'll talk about it
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.860]   and we'll bring that into the discussion.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.060]   You know, absolutely.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.320]   I mean, I think you and I talk about it
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.820]   pretty much on every pod, we're analysts.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.060]   As analysts, the one thing we're reasonably okay at
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.100]   is we ask questions, we dig in, we find our way to experts,
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.900]   we find our way to information.
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.340]   And frankly, the more digging we did
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.180]   about Diablo and about nuclear,
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.340]   it's just so clear that it has to be part
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.740]   of the energy constellation future of the United States.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.580]   I think that's correct. It's clean, it's dense,
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.740]   it's the exact type of energy that we need.
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.700]   So why don't we kick off
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.260]   with a little bit of background today?
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.860]   We'll weave in some discussion about Diablo,
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.620]   we're gonna talk to Marine Zawalny,
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.740]   we're gonna talk about China's emerging advantage here,
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.900]   right, like, why are they on such a fast path
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.940]   and a cheap path to nuclear?
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.420]   Hone in on those costs.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.540]   And then some of the things that we believe we gotta do
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.380]   in order to get the United States back on the nuclear track
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.420]   and maybe end with a little bit of that positive.
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.260]   - That'd be great.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.680]   And one thing I wanted to share with the audience,
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.120]   I think we've uncovered some really amazing documents,
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.460]   research, pieces of research, podcasts, that kind of thing.
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.960]   So we're gonna put a list of those together
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.800]   in the show notes.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.580]   And if anyone wants to follow the journey we've been on
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.620]   and go a little bit deeper
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.180]   than what we're gonna talk about today,
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.380]   those will be available.
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260]   Marine, it's great to be here.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.020]   Marine Zawalny, Vice President here at Diablo Canyon.
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.260]   It's just been an incredible day.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.420]   Thank you for having Bill and I here.
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.140]   You know, maybe just a little background on Diablo Canyon.
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.820]   You know, it took 10 years to build this,
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.880]   you know, starting in 1970.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.220]   It cost $16 billion to build both reactors.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.220]   It went online in 1985.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.060]   It's the state's single largest power station.
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.260]   It generates about eight to 9% of total energy,
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.540]   about 20% of all the renewable energy in the state
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.020]   at a cost of about six cents per kilowatt hour.
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.860]   So very cheap relative to the power
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.700]   that we import in the state.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.280]   It's been an extraordinary day going around.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.300]   And I think one of the things we'd love to start with
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.340]   is just a little bit of the history,
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.620]   your history here at Diablo.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.460]   - Well, great.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.420]   First of all, thank you for coming.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.980]   And it's always great to get people here
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.420]   that have not been here before and putting eyes on it
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.460]   and looking at the facility,
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.020]   seeing the security around it,
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.260]   the safety around it and so forth.
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.440]   And so I've been out here for 30 years
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.140]   and I've raised my children here in the community
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.420]   and I've had various different positions out here.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.820]   We are the largest private employer in the community.
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.460]   And what is just amazing
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.220]   and just something I like to highlight a lot
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.220]   is the strong safety culture we have out here,
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.100]   the strong use of standards
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.980]   and the history of the excellence in safely
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.840]   and reliably operating this nuclear power plant.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.660]   - Well, given how safely you operate it,
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.500]   I appreciate you letting us into the control room.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.980]   It's just the simulator of the control room.
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.220]   But that was very evident today.
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.660]   The fact of the matter is the history of the last 10 years
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.900]   has not been smooth sailing here at Diablo Canyon.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.180]   Tell us a little bit about like what took you on the path
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.100]   of decommissioning this two and a half gig facility
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.260]   and kind of where you are today.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.100]   - Great question.
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.500]   So, you know, 10 years ago, eight, 10 years ago,
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.060]   the energy equations and the need for Diablo
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.100]   had very different assumptions and inputs.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.700]   What I mean by that in the 2015 timeframe, 2016 timeframe,
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.540]   you know, we weren't talking about AI.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.540]   We weren't talking about data centers.
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.900]   We weren't talking about the electrification goals
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.980]   of the state and of the country.
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.460]   We didn't have geopolitical things going on
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.220]   like the Russian invasion in Ukraine.
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.660]   So that has like a squeeze on some of our supply
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.620]   for nuclear fuel and uranium.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.060]   And so you have all of that and then you add on the drought
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.940]   and the climate stuff going on
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.260]   and the severe heat and the wildfires.
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.580]   And what I mean by wildfires is that's impacting
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.340]   our bringing in energy to California
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.060]   and affecting our transmission lines of importing in energy.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.660]   So you don't have all that back in 2016.
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.260]   Now fast forward to 2020, August, rolling blackouts,
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.500]   seeing just peak demands on the system
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.060]   and on the grid in California.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.500]   And really re-looking at that needs analysis,
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.740]   is Diablo needed given now all these new factors?
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.740]   You run all those numbers and you know, what we're seeing,
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.540]   it's very hard to pull off
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.420]   the largest clean energy producer,
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.740]   the largest energy producer in California.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.340]   That's about nine to 10% of Californians.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.420]   So the projects to replace,
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.020]   the renewable projects to replace,
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.100]   Diablo have not made the progress
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.820]   that I think the state thought it would back in 2015, 2016.
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.500]   - So this is things like offshore wind.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.860]   - Correct, offshore wind projects and so forth.
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.380]   We need a mix of it all for not only California,
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.380]   but for the country.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.860]   We need a mix of solar and wind,
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.860]   hydro and clean nuclear energy
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.060]   to meet the goals that we have of this country
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.180]   and of the state.
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.580]   - Yeah, I think a lot of the people in our industry
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.100]   have kind of been on a pro-nuclear bandwagon
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.140]   past five years.
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.060]   - Yeah.
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.260]   - And that appears now to be something
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.140]   that's kind of tipped across the US.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.460]   Take us back to prior to that starting to happen.
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.940]   What were the forces that were pushing for decommissioning?
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.940]   - So the main force was the projections
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:39.860]   by the Energy Commission and other energy advisors
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.340]   was showing that there wasn't a need for Diablo.
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.660]   That was the main driver.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.700]   So there were a number of things that were going on in 2016.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.420]   And what was important was that we were being used
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.820]   for a bridging strategy
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.780]   to get to have those other renewable projects
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.420]   come online to replace us in 2024 and 2025.
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.060]   So here we are.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.060]   Unit one's current license expires November 2nd of 2024.
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.100]   And it'll be really interesting to look at
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.620]   what's going on November 3rd and 4th with our grid
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.380]   had we taken unit one off.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.300]   So we're right there, right?
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.500]   Unit two's current license expires in August of 2025.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.860]   But we've put in for a 20 year license renewal application
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.180]   with the federal regulator,
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.860]   the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.380]   Even though the state's only asked us for five,
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.900]   we've done that to make sure we maximize the optionality
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.380]   for the state and seeing the progress
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.500]   of those other projects coming online to replace Diablo.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.380]   - It's inconceivable to me.
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.500]   I mean, we're just in the generating facility.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.380]   This is an extraordinarily efficient operation
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:50.220]   for the production of very dense baseload power.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.340]   Elon Musk recently said, with respect to Germany,
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:57.860]   that it's utter madness to take plants like this offline.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.820]   When you look at the shift over the last 10 years,
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.620]   characterize your own view.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.180]   Obviously, you're an interested party here,
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.700]   but given the state's increasing needs for baseload power
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.820]   and the fact that some of these things
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.340]   have come online slower,
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.540]   I assume you would agree it would be utter madness
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.380]   to take Diablo offline.
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.100]   - And I would, and I would from being an engineer
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.180]   and a scientist who loves to work in facts.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:30.580]   Nuclear's capacity factors, you said efficient,
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.580]   their capacity factors, Diablo's upwards of 90%, right?
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.860]   And we have had our units run at 93, 94%.
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.780]   You can't mess with those numbers.
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.700]   We're available 24/7, 365 days a year, rain or shine.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.460]   And so much needed if you need to store some of that energy
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.060]   or need that energy for the high demand
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.140]   that we see in extreme conditions.
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.660]   I mean, this today, right now,
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.620]   we're under restricted maintenance operations by the state
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.540]   because it's in the hundreds degrees
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.300]   in the majority of the state
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.900]   and the demand is gonna be so high
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.180]   and we don't wanna have what happened
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.340]   in August of 2020 happen again.
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.180]   I mean, that's about people's--
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.820]   - Rolling blackouts. - Rolling blackouts.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.020]   That's about people's lives.
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.300]   That's people in hospitals.
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.940]   I mean, you see the tragedies in Texas going on, right?
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.740]   We need to be doing something about it.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.780]   So it would be utter madness and scientifically wrong.
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.060]   And I say that from 35 years in the industry
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.220]   as a nuclear engineer with confidence.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.300]   - Right.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.300]   Can you talk about the potential timeline for Diablo?
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.180]   'Cause you mentioned earlier
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.700]   that the state had talked about five years
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.300]   but you're applying for 20.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.980]   How far theoretically could it run
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.860]   or how long theoretically could it run?
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:52.700]   - Sure.
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.980]   So the current licenses
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.260]   for all United States nuclear power plants
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.500]   is your original licenses for 40 years, okay?
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.980]   Then there's a process that we're in right now
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.260]   to renew it for 20 more years.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.540]   And just about every nuclear unit in the United States
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.220]   has submitted for that except for a few of us.
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.540]   We had previously submitted,
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.060]   but part of the decommissioning
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.860]   or the shutting down agreement in 2016
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.220]   was to pull that application back.
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.700]   And then there's about a dozen plants
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.460]   that are going for subsequent license renewal applications
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.460]   to go 20 more.
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.620]   - From 60 to 80.
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.420]   - Yeah, so go 80 years.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.420]   And so the NRC has these processes
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.100]   'cause just like renewing your driver's license
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.340]   that you have to do on a periodicity,
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.780]   you wanna be looking at the licenses
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:37.740]   and the components and so forth at every nuclear plant.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.980]   So they have that opportunity as a safety regulator
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.660]   to approve those phases.
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.820]   - This is something you educated me on today.
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.060]   I think I was under the perception
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.700]   that there was some kind of finite life
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.860]   to one of these facilities
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.340]   because of something about nuclear I didn't understand,
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.260]   but I'm walking away now thinking
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.140]   that the plant is upgradable and maintainable,
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.380]   and it's just a matter of keeping it in tip-top shape,
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.220]   meeting all the safety standards
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.340]   and then reapplying for these licenses.
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.180]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:11.180]   We run this station to excellence and performance,
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.940]   as I said, from a safety perspective,
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.700]   from an operational, from a maintenance, engineering,
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.500]   everything that it takes.
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.820]   We are in the highest compliance ranking
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.420]   of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.940]   and we have achieved many evaluations
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.300]   by an industry group
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.100]   that evaluates all nuclear power plants
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.380]   in the world of excellence performance
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.700]   in operation and safety and reliability.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.100]   So we run this plant very well,
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.820]   and that's what made it such a fairly easy call
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.900]   from the state of California of,
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.660]   hey, what would it take?
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.060]   What's the point of no return?
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.700]   Could you keep operating Diablo Canyon?
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.260]   And that was the legislation of Senate Bill 846
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.780]   in September of 2022,
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.780]   because we're regulated by both the federal government
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.780]   and the state government.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.020]   So the state government think
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.380]   the California Public Utility Commission,
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.820]   they just approved in December of 2023
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.500]   our new expiration dates, which is 2029 and 2030.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.700]   State Lands Commission,
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.860]   you got to see the intake and the discharge.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.580]   We have leases with them,
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.460]   so that they just extended it for five more years
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.660]   or up to 2030.
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.500]   And then State Water Resource Control Board,
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.420]   we had to get the continued exemption
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.860]   for things like once-through cooling
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.460]   that has been required
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.540]   because of the way our system is designed,
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.500]   our plant is designed.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.700]   - Just to be clear,
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:34.300]   the current governor could extend
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.180]   the plant's useful life for an additional 15 years
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:42.460]   beyond 2030, assuming the federal 20-year extension
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.060]   comes through, which you expect to come through.
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.220]   Now, of course, at any point along the way,
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.940]   they could say we have excess power generation.
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.340]   All of a sudden, we had a breakthrough in solar or wind
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.500]   and we don't need Diablo anymore.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.500]   But there's an opportunity over the next two years, Bill,
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:03.500]   for Governor Newsom to extend the operating license
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.060]   here in the state on Diablo,
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.900]   which seems to me, given our present power needs
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.340]   and what we see inflecting up,
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.540]   we've talked a lot about what's happening in AI.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.740]   I'm sure you've had the hyperscalers down here
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.740]   talking to you guys, talking to Patty at PG&E
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.060]   about their power needs.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.380]   But if we're gonna build data centers
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.300]   in the state of California,
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.580]   as I was walking around here today,
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.540]   I was thinking to myself,
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.340]   they ought to be building data centers right here.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.100]   You have plenty of excess land
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.380]   and plugging them into these incredible
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.180]   power-generating machines that we have.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.820]   So that's the opportunity right now for Diablo
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.700]   is to extend for another 15 years beyond 2030.
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.380]   - We will stay ready for that call, if we get that call.
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.340]   - Do you wanna get that call?
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.180]   - Absolutely wanna get that call.
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.020]   - What's the argument?
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.020]   I mean, tell me if I'm wrong,
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.100]   but what's the argument for decommissioning nuclear
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.340]   ahead of coal?
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.900]   Like there's no argument, is there?
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.100]   - I think it gets down to the energy policies
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.780]   and how you define renewable versus greenhouse gas free.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.020]   And Senate Bill 350, I believe is the number from 2015.
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:13.140]   And at the very end of that bill,
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.140]   they changed the word greenhouse gas free to renewable
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.100]   and excluded nuclear and large hydro.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.260]   So we need a mix of renewables.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.100]   - Who's they?
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.820]   - Yeah, I mean, legislators, yeah.
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.940]   Which is fine because again,
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.260]   that's what was known in 2015 timeframe.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.740]   Very different equation and formula
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.220]   that we are navigating through
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.780]   with all the things I mentioned earlier.
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.100]   - Yeah, that's why I go to some of the smartest people
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.980]   in our world, whether it's Elon or Patrick Collison
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.340]   or Steven Pinker is not in our world,
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.180]   but a very smart individual.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:51.500]   I think they would all argue you take coal and gas off
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.100]   before you take nuclear off.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.460]   - I would say, and then to reverse it or flip it
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.660]   is just go after as much carbon free as you can.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.980]   - Totally, totally agree.
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.460]   - And work on that, the latter part there.
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.700]   But again, going for the 20 or applying
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.020]   for the 20 year licensed renewal application,
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.500]   which is the NRC's process.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.420]   That's what they approve.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.460]   So like in the state of New York,
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.420]   Indian Point was a plant which applied
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.540]   for the 20 year licensed renewal NRC process,
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.380]   got that approval.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.020]   And then the state decided,
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.260]   hey, we have enough renewable in that
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.460]   and we don't need the nuclear power plant.
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.140]   And after about 10 years or so, I don't have the exacts.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.220]   But I mean, that is we are governed
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.740]   and regulated by both the state and the federal government.
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.940]   - It's hard to believe, it's hard for me to see a future.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.060]   Okay, when you have China,
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:42.300]   who's adding six to eight new fission reactors per year,
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.260]   it's gonna add upwards of 25 or 30
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.220]   over the course of the next five or six years
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.300]   is expected to surpass the United States
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.340]   in nuclear power production by 2030.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.300]   You've been around this for 30 years.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:59.180]   The United States has been preeminent in nuclear technology.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.940]   We built most of our plants in the '70s and '80s.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:06.540]   By the '90s, we basically had stopped building new plants.
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.140]   We were talking about decommissioning
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.220]   all of the plants that we had.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.020]   As you look at the political environment today,
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.540]   not just in California,
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.820]   but you spend a lot of time around the world, right?
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.660]   Advising, interacting with your operating peers
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.300]   in lots of other countries.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.260]   Where are we in terms of that pendulum
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.140]   in the United States swinging back and forth?
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:34.540]   You're clearly more optimistic than you were in 2016
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.500]   when they passed the legislation
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.140]   or you entered the agreement to shut down Diablo.
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.100]   But is there hope, is there a future
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:48.100]   for shifting the gears back into expanding fission,
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.860]   base load power production in the United States?
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.900]   - Absolutely, and I think Diablo Canyon is the case study.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.620]   And what I mean by that, on a micro level,
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.300]   what I call that when I consider the need
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.100]   of what Secretary Gronholm and COP 28 has said
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.660]   that we need triple the amount of nuclear
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.340]   for our environmental and climate policies.
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.260]   So I say micro level for Diablo Canyon
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.700]   because what we did in a year and a half, two years
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.780]   is what is needed to keep that pendulum swinging
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.860]   and the momentum needed to build out
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.220]   traditional more nuclear
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.980]   and preserving the current 94 units we have,
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.580]   if we count the new Vogel three and four that came online,
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.340]   which is outstanding, right?
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.820]   And so we can't have any of the current 94 shutting down,
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.660]   let's preserve that.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.700]   There are some other initiatives,
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.260]   Palisades, a plant in Michigan
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.820]   that they're looking to restart.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.020]   And they're really looking at a lot of the stuff we did,
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.100]   we call it team pivot or pivoting from decommissioning
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.900]   and getting that call from the state in 2022
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.260]   to continuing to operate.
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.820]   And that's hiring over 300 people
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.620]   in an efficient speedy time,
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:02.060]   working communicatively, coordinated and transparent
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.460]   with our regulators on what needs to be done.
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.780]   Just lots of examples there that I think can be used
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.020]   on a macro level to keep that momentum going
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:17.300]   that we're showing that can be done here at Diablo Canyon.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.460]   - One thing, another thing I learned today
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.340]   that I was really impressed by,
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.860]   I wonder if you could share with the audience, Maureen,
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:28.860]   is that there are both national and worldwide communities
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.660]   where you share best practice with other operators.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.820]   And I'm thrilled to know that that's true.
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.140]   I didn't know that that was true.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.220]   Can you talk more about that?
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.060]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.300]   In fact, we're here at Diablo Canyon Simulator
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.900]   and that came after the unfortunate event
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.260]   at Three Mile Island in 1979,
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.460]   and also the formation of the Institute
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.300]   of Nuclear Power Operations.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.660]   And I think what you're asking about
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.660]   is a fundamental thing in nuclear
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.940]   and our nuclear industry is anything that happens anywhere
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.100]   happens to all of us.
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.900]   And we're a culture of continuous improvement,
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.460]   a culture of self-aware and self-correcting,
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.740]   and we wanna learn from each other.
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.300]   So we share information.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.660]   You don't see that between the airline industries.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.460]   I heard an example recently, even with hospitals,
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:22.180]   even the same hospitals in different units, we value that.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:26.340]   Something happens with a certain motor or a pump
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:30.180]   or a generator or human performance item,
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.820]   it's called operating experience.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.020]   We all own that.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.100]   We enter it into a system called Corrective Action Program,
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.740]   get the learnings from it, make adjustments we need to,
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:45.300]   to how we operate, train, do maintenance and so forth.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:50.300]   And that's just a continuum as we seek excellence
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.340]   and again, safe and reliable operations.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.180]   That's great.
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.900]   Well, one of the things Bill and I
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.460]   are gonna spend a lot of time talking about today
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.700]   is the cost differential around the world
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.060]   from building Vogel
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.740]   versus what they're building AP1000s for
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.380]   in South Korea, as an example.
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.180]   When you think about the state of the supply chain
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.060]   in the United States,
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.460]   when you think about that talent network
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.020]   that you're a part of, right?
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.540]   That you have to go tap into when you wanna hire people.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.100]   You know, there's a certain amount of that
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.820]   that we gotta tap into just to keep the 94 reactors online.
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.980]   But if we wanna start building more reactors, more Vogels,
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.660]   and we wanna drive down the costs, right?
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.660]   Of scaling up these level three
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.060]   and now advanced nuclear reactors.
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.100]   Do we have the talent?
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.900]   Do we have the supply chain?
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.140]   Do we have the capability?
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.220]   What needs to be done?
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.060]   What do you wish was different today?
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.140]   Well, that's a great question.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:58.140]   It did take a Herculean effort to get the human resources
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.020]   and the other resources we needed, but we did it.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.980]   You know, we had a mantra around here.
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.500]   What needs to be true to hire the people we need
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.900]   to restart up our senior reactor operator license classes,
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.460]   to get operators trained and qualified
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.820]   and proficient can be upwards of three, four years.
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.140]   You know, what do we need to do that?
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.180]   But we did it.
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.540]   But on a macro level, on a bigger scale
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.300]   for the US and on supply chain, I can't emphasize enough.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.620]   It's a collective effort.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.260]   And you have to also fold in there the financial part of it
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.060]   and the regulatory model of it.
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:41.100]   We are a highly regulated industry
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.940]   and that's good.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.300]   You know, we're running a nuclear reactors
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.260]   and nuclear power plants, you know,
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.140]   but there were ways that we were able to put
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.900]   in more innovation or processes or tools to navigate
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.860]   through a 3000 page license renewal application,
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:23:59.700]   for instance.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.380]   So there needs to be that kind of thinking,
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.380]   that kind of breakthrough thinking on, you know,
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.780]   how do we get there?
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:10.780]   And I worry sometimes that there might be a group over here
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.460]   trying to do it in a group over here
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.500]   and then they're competing
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.740]   and then it's just not gonna come to fruition.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:20.740]   Like, how do we do that on a national energy policy level
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.140]   to move forward?
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.860]   I'm very encouraged by the, you know,
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.260]   the civil nuclear credit program that we qualified for
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.820]   by the DOE, the ADVANCE Act.
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.740]   I mean, it's a bipartisan discussion now.
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.780]   So I think that's been a huge step.
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.820]   So I have hope, but you need to have that breakthrough
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.060]   and that what needs to be true thinking
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.780]   to collectively get that done.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:47.740]   Another thing, Bill, that was amazing to me today,
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:52.220]   you know, I've heard a lot about nuclear waste, right?
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.780]   Spent fuel rods.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.180]   And we had the chance to go by the safety facility
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.620]   where you store these spent fuel rods.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.220]   And there are two things that struck me
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.420]   as pretty extraordinary.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.980]   One, and maybe you could just share, like, you know,
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.820]   what is the space required for the spent fuel rods
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:11.660]   in the United States?
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.220]   And this is, given that we have a moratorium,
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.540]   we could reprocess 90% of this, but we don't,
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.380]   like France does.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.780]   So even in the case where we don't reprocess
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.540]   any of these fuel rods, I think you said,
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.740]   you gave an incredible fact about the total space
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.940]   that would be occupied from all the spent fuel rods,
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.620]   from all 94 of the nuclear plants.
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.700]   And I just thought sharing that information
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.540]   would be interesting.
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.380]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.060]   So absent of having a federal facility
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.420]   to take all of the spent nuclear fuel
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.700]   from all the commercial nuclear reactors,
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.820]   each of the individual utilities or sites
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:51.340]   have their own independent spent fuel storage installation.
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.060]   We all have an acronym, ISFSI, that you saw today,
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.260]   I took you up there.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.780]   And our pad has enough capacity
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.860]   for all 40 years of the original license.
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.620]   And we have enough for 60 years collectively on site,
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.860]   or over 60 years, including the spent fuel pools,
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:06.860]   the wet storage.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.860]   You roll up all of that footprint,
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.460]   and you got to see it's very small.
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.580]   And you take all of the over 100 units in the United States,
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.980]   it would fit in the size of a football field
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.580]   up to the goal posts.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.300]   And that's the total of the spent nuclear fuel.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.020]   Now you start reprocessing that,
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.900]   and you have, again, a federal policy change
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.220]   from the Carter administration
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.780]   to allow for reprocessing like France does.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.180]   You can get about, you hear numbers between 80, 90%
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:41.020]   of isotopic use of being able to use it again.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.460]   - That's extraordinary.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.500]   Single football field,
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.660]   and we could actually reprocess 90% of that.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.540]   - And that would help a lot
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.580]   on your supply chain question,
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.820]   with where the market is right now
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.700]   with enriched uranium product and so forth.
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.580]   - Yeah.
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.580]   One thing I would just highlight
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:02.580]   is really I was blown away by the operational excellence.
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.940]   You can see it in everything that's going on here.
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.940]   And I do think Diablo was this kind of massive turning point
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.140]   for the industry, for the nuclear industry in the US.
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.460]   There was so much.
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:19.380]   I think people were committed to decommissioning this thing
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:22.300]   that many of us believe is the cleanest,
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.820]   most resourceful source of power you could have.
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:30.420]   And as you stated, now we have a lot of momentum,
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.740]   bipartisan support for the industry writ large.
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.780]   So anyway, I think we all owe you thanks
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.540]   for what you guys have done here.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.660]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.420]   - It's an incredible team out here that are dedicated,
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.180]   committed to those excellent standards.
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.740]   They're community members.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.340]   They teach little league.
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.340]   We contribute so much with volunteer hours.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.580]   There's so much pride out here and there's generations
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.700]   of people out here and their footprint,
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.340]   which is you can't walk around San Luis Obispo
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.260]   and say you work at Diablo Canyon and say,
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.140]   "Oh, do you know?"
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.540]   I mean, it's just, it's incredible.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.380]   - That's great.
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.900]   - You know, I also recently listened to a podcast
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.940]   with Patty Poppe, the CEO of PG&E.
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:11.780]   - I know her.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:12.940]   - It was great.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:17.940]   Your boss, your boss, for everybody else, the CEO of PG&E.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:22.340]   And it was great to hear her support for Diablo Canyon.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.340]   It was great to hear her support for, frankly,
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.460]   a lot of innovation, right?
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.820]   Whether it's grid innovation, whether it's two-way,
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.620]   you know, charge and discharge with cars,
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.620]   whether it's undergrounding of power transmission lines,
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.300]   which we talked a lot about today,
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.340]   leads to higher efficiency, you know,
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:45.340]   less, you know, lower cost to retail customers.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.940]   So it does feel like there's a lot of upside
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:53.380]   and Diablo's, you know, kind of the tip of that spear.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.220]   Thanks for having us.
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.580]   We're certainly, you know, going to put the word out
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:28:59.820]   to the governor and others.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.220]   I would love to see this place extended for 15 years.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.340]   It's the type of optionality that we need in the state.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.980]   And frankly, a huge portion of the incremental bid
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.180]   for power is coming out of Silicon Valley, right?
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:17.100]   Power is the primitive for AI.
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:21.180]   And that's why China is heads down in this race.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.980]   And they're taking our technology, right?
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.460]   And they're, you know, they're improving it.
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.740]   And it's high time, I think, that the United States
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.020]   got, you know, back on board and with leaders like you,
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.260]   you know, at the front of the pack,
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.260]   I think we're in a good place.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.700]   So thanks for being with us today.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.580]   Thank you for being here.
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:38.860]   It's been a great day.
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.500]   Before I kick in with a little bit of background,
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.980]   I do want to thank the incredible team at Diablo,
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.140]   Maureen Zwolnick, you know,
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.980]   who is one of the incredible leaders here.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.060]   And, you know, a startup founder, Trey Lauderdale.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:55.460]   You know, after we talked about nuclear on pod six,
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.740]   he reached out to me, he said,
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.620]   hey, I think there's incredible opportunities here
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.940]   to make it even more efficient leveraging AI.
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.220]   He's got a partnership here with Diablo.
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.700]   And so thanks to them for having us down here.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.140]   It's been a great day.
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.700]   And to give ourselves a little bit of credit,
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.860]   one advantage you have as an outsider
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.460]   is you see things with a fresh set of eyes.
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.860]   And so maybe for the audience,
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.140]   we will uncover a few tidbits that they will find useful
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.260]   as they think about this.
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.540]   Yeah, I mean, listen,
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.780]   I have to say that I'm embarrassed how little I focused
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.300]   on this issue up until a few years ago.
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.060]   The truth is the United States has been a global leader
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:35.380]   in nuclear power for 50 years, okay?
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.300]   We commissioned our first nuclear
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:41.100]   electricity generating plant in 1957.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.740]   The majority of American plants
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.820]   are built in the '70s and '80s.
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:49.580]   We have 94 plants today online representing 31%
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.540]   of the world's total nuclear energy production.
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:57.020]   It's 20% of total US power production
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.940]   and nearly 50% of US clean energy production.
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.900]   It's large, it's at scale, we've been leaders.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.340]   The problem is that it represents the effects
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:11.140]   of investments and efforts and an installed base
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:15.340]   that largely stopped in the 1990s, right?
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.780]   China's on track, on the other hand,
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.740]   to bring on more capacity in the next 10 years
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.340]   than we've brought on in the last 40 years.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.980]   They're expected to pass us in terms of total power
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:32.780]   generation from nuclear by 2030 or thereabouts.
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.620]   Our supply chain is atrophying.
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.540]   However, there does seem to be some growing
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:42.740]   bipartisan recognition that we gotta get this back on track.
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.700]   And that's a key reason we wanted to come down here today.
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:50.580]   So as you look at this, Bill, what are some of the things
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:54.020]   that we ought to just set as a baseline about nuclear?
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.220]   Well, one thing that I would say is super important,
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.980]   especially because we have an audience
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.420]   that includes entrepreneurs,
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:04.580]   we're gonna talk first about level three fission.
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:05.700]   Yes, yes.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.700]   There's level four, which is a different type
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.580]   of cooling technique.
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.100]   There's one plant in China doing that.
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.820]   There's SMRs, which are small modular reactors,
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.580]   which a lot of startups are excited about.
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.980]   And then there's obviously eventually fusion,
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.140]   which is a big unknown about the timeline.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.740]   But for the next window until we stop,
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.420]   we're just talking about level three fission,
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.460]   which is a big scale out discussion.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.300]   That's what's operating here at Diablo.
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.180]   That's what's operating in the majority
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.260]   of nuclear plants around the world.
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:41.140]   So a couple of ways you could go through things.
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:45.580]   First of all, we have been through this roller coaster
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:50.500]   of emotional beliefs about nuclear energy.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.140]   And many people tie that way back to association
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.300]   with the bomb and this inability to think
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.660]   about these two things separately.
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.980]   We had the Three Mile Island incident,
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:07.500]   Chernobyl, Fukushima, and all these things have an impact
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.020]   on what people's perceptions of nuclear.
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.620]   I would argue based on the research I've done,
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.380]   the healthcare impact of all three of those disasters
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:19.180]   is tiny compared to the healthcare impact of coal
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.420]   or other technologies that nuclear competes with.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.780]   But people's perception,
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.900]   the media overplayed those things as well.
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:31.060]   And it's only been recently that the public sentiment
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.340]   has started to swing back in favor of nuclear.
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.900]   Most of the brightest people in our industry,
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.900]   that Elon, Patrick Collison, I see a pro-nuclear bias.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.580]   And I'm a huge fan of people like Steve Pinker,
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.740]   who's one of the great thinkers in our world.
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.100]   He's got a huge pro-nuclear bias.
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.380]   But a lot of people weren't on that page.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.460]   Now, more and more people are on that page.
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.660]   - I mean, what's amazing is even in Japan,
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:00.220]   where after Fukushima,
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.580]   they took all 30 nuclear reactors offline.
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.620]   I think they have 75% approval rating
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.940]   for people wanting to put those reactors back online,
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:10.540]   because I think there's a recognition in the world, okay,
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.820]   that it's clean.
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:17.100]   It's the type of dense, always-on nuclear power
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:17.940]   that you need. - It's incredible.
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.340]   - And the facts are just undisputable.
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.340]   It's safe.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.860]   - Well, and this goes back to that statement.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:27.180]   I think I actually stole it from Joshua at Lux,
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:30.460]   but that if this were discovered today,
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.300]   people would be like,
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.540]   "Oh my God, climate change is solved."
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.620]   But if we let it go through this place
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.020]   where it was associated with these negative things,
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.220]   I don't think we're accurate.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:43.060]   But now, hopefully, we're moving to a place
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.580]   where people are open-minded.
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.060]   So you could also look through
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.380]   a bunch of different countries.
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:51.220]   So France is, most people know this,
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.620]   75% of their energy from nuclear.
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.660]   They've been the one that stayed in there the longest,
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.100]   leaned in the hardest.
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.500]   You have Germany, which I think people think of
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.180]   as the ultimate disaster,
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.260]   where they've taken all their plants,
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.100]   they've decommissioned everything.
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.460]   And because of some of the things
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.300]   that have played out in the European market,
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:15.580]   they're now a net importer of fossil fuel energy.
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.900]   - Disastrous.
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.940]   They got sold a bill of good by the Greens.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.780]   Merkel decides to shut down all the nuclear power plants.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:26.380]   You can see how it just falls off a cliff and goes to zero.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.580]   And instead, they're getting fossil fuel-produced energy.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.780]   They're less secure, both from an energy perspective.
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.260]   I mean, remember at the start
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:38.020]   of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.140]   we had all the conversations as to whether or not
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.380]   people were gonna freeze in Germany during the winter,
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.500]   et cetera, because they had taken all these plants offline.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.340]   - Unbelievable.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.340]   And one thing we've learned through this process is,
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:52.140]   one of the silliest things you could possibly do
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.140]   is decommission 'cause you already paid for the damn thing.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.820]   Once you turn one off, as Marina shared with us,
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.340]   it's a lot harder to bring it back.
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.620]   We're gonna see if that can work.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.700]   - Right.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.500]   - And so anyway, and there's a fourth country
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.420]   we should talk about.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.100]   So you already mentioned China.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.220]   - Yeah.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:12.980]   - One of the amazing, well, let me dive deep on China
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.460]   and then I'll mention the fourth country.
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:18.780]   So this is publicly available data so people can go get it.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.500]   We recently brought on two new plants in the U.S.,
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.140]   Vogel 3 and 4 in Georgia.
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.340]   And the total cost of that was about 30 billion
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:29.940]   for 2.2 gigawatts.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.940]   It turns out over $13 billion per gigawatt.
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.180]   The plants in China that are the equivalent
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.300]   level three fission plants right now
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.340]   are coming on board at 2.5 billion per gigawatt.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.180]   - Right.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.020]   - So 13 to 2.5.
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.060]   - Right, right.
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.300]   - And that's a shocking delta.
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.140]   - Yes.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:54.540]   - And one of, I would say the single most surprising thing
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.420]   to me of all the discussions I've had in the past two weeks
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.380]   with everyone that's in this industry
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.180]   is how few people are shocked by that.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.300]   - Right, well, let's talk about that a little bit.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.940]   When you look at the cost differential,
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:10.060]   which I think is one of the biggest problems today
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.420]   with U.S. nuclear, and I wanna decompose
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.860]   as to why you think there's such a delta,
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.660]   but let's just talk about what it is.
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.500]   Vogel had a bunch of stuff as they were going through COVID,
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.660]   so let's say that that is more expensive
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.140]   than what a run rate AP-1000.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:29.780]   This is the type of gen three nuclear reactor
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.180]   that they're building in South Korea, in China,
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.060]   and at Vogel, right?
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.060]   - Since you mentioned Korea, that's the fourth country,
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.500]   so let me just real quickly go there.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.740]   So Korea, so a lot of people look at the China data
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.300]   and they go, "Oh, that's China."
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.620]   You know, authoritarian government,
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:49.380]   and they're able to dismiss it because it's different.
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:54.380]   South Korea is a democracy, a friend of the United States.
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.180]   They're at the same delivered price point as China,
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.220]   and they're doing it at scale,
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:04.260]   and they're starting to export their technology.
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.540]   So in some ways, just because I think it's easier
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:12.540]   for Americans to wrap their head around it as a data point,
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:15.620]   the South Korea data is more interesting than the China.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.220]   - Right, so let's talk about it.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.940]   Let's break this down a little bit,
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:23.940]   because both the South Koreans and the Chinese, right,
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.100]   are building on technology that they procured
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.220]   from the United States, from Westinghouse,
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.940]   under tech transfer licenses over the course of the past,
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.260]   you know, 20 or 30 years, okay?
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.740]   Now they're building a lot of indigenous technologies
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.500]   on the back of that technology,
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.140]   and yet building the exact same technology,
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.740]   even though it was invented here,
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.740]   it costs us, give or take, four times as much
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.980]   as what they're spending to build in South Korea or China.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:59.020]   So give us your best guess.
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:02.380]   What are the big buckets that are costing, you know,
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.980]   this cost differential in the United States,
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.620]   and whether or not there's anything that we can do about it?
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.700]   - And I wanna come back to later.
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.580]   I'll answer your question,
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:14.660]   but I wanna come back to the built on our technology thing,
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.380]   'cause I think there's some important things
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.500]   to talk about there.
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.860]   So I went out and talked to a whole bunch of people,
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.380]   and I was able to talk to one individual
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.780]   who had worked both in the regulatory part
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:30.060]   of our government and at a producer
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.220]   who I think had a really good lens on all this,
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.380]   and I'm gonna leave him anonymous,
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.660]   but he brought up four things.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.300]   So the first was regulatory.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.620]   So the separate federal and state
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.980]   environmental permitting processes in the U.S.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.660]   is onerous, lengthy, probably 10 years
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:52.580]   for a nuclear power plant, expensive.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.780]   Most people don't know this.
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.180]   They have no reason to know this,
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.500]   but the NRC is a fee-based regulatory.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.420]   So you literally pay per hour
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.580]   to have 'em come regulate you.
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:06.180]   And so those costs are extremely high.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.660]   The second thing is litigation.
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.860]   So multiple special interest groups,
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.460]   particularly environmental groups,
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:14.540]   will sue to stop any development whatsoever.
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.900]   So there's no chance of a deployment
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:20.860]   or an attempted deployment without fending off
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.980]   inbound litigation that you have to deal with in the U.S.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:31.540]   The third is passage of time without us doing anything.
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.780]   And so everyone talks about learning curves.
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.860]   We're so far off the learning curve
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.340]   'cause these two new plants were the first in 30 years.
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.860]   So there's no repeatable process,
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.580]   which you now have in China and there.
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:50.260]   And then that's all before you look at other things.
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:53.300]   I would say labor, cost of steel, cement,
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.980]   those things can be higher here than there.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.860]   And so it's a whole big litany of stuff added up
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.380]   and none of those factors apply in China.
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.220]   - Right, right.
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.980]   If we could boil that down,
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.900]   the way I kind of got my head around it is,
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.780]   one, if you just look at the length of time.
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.340]   So now they're building these AP 1000s
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:17.380]   in South Korea and in China in about seven to eight years.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.380]   And in the United States- - Six, I think six even.
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.780]   - Maybe as fast as six.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.300]   In the United States, it's not 10.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.740]   It's more like 12 to 15, okay?
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.180]   So it's taking us twice as long
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.300]   to bring one of these plants online.
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.860]   Time equals money.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.780]   - And you and I talked about this,
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:38.780]   but a modern, large, multi-gigawatt vision facility
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:43.100]   is a large piece of infrastructure.
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:43.940]   - Exactly.
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:47.220]   - It's not like you're building even a rocket engine.
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.140]   It's more than that.
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:48.980]   It's this big facility.
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.700]   - You look at the South Koreans or the Chinese
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:55.020]   building a highway, an airport, a hospital, a school.
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.500]   - A subway station. - A subway station.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.860]   - Have you seen these videos?
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.460]   Go on, if you haven't, go on YouTube
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.860]   and look at China's new subway station.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:03.700]   Unbelievable.
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:08.700]   And so the US, the first thing is just
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.900]   our regulatory environment causes it
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.380]   to take a much longer period of time, and time is money.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.780]   Secondly then, we don't have a scale up
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.900]   or scale out operation going on, right?
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.820]   Two facilities over the course of the last 20 years
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.940]   compared to six to eight of these
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.700]   in a repeatable process coming online in China.
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.220]   That means supply chain.
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.940]   That means talent chain.
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:36.020]   That means that regulators are constantly talking
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.340]   with the operators.
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.180]   You just have the type of system
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.780]   that you need to drive down costs.
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.460]   And in fact, if you look at these gen three
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.700]   and gen four reactors coming online,
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.980]   even in the United States,
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:51.260]   they always cost more in that first plant.
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.860]   But by plant five, it was cut in half.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.860]   By plant 10, it was cut by 70%, right?
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:00.140]   So cost comes down as you ramp up scale production.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.300]   Think about the Roadster was a lot more expensive
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.260]   for Tesla to build, right?
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.940]   Than the model three,
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.260]   once you are producing a million of these cars.
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.700]   So we need to get to a place
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.380]   where we also have scale production.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.220]   And then the third, what everybody tends to focus on
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.500]   is kind of this labor differential.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.380]   I would put that in the third bucket,
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.900]   but it's like a third, a third, a third, and this adds up.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.460]   It seems to me the first two, right?
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:28.540]   We can tackle, right?
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.300]   You can consolidate the regulatory environment
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.460]   in the United States so that you reduce the time
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.420]   to bring one of these things online.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:38.660]   And I also think that if you clustered some of these,
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.980]   if we wanted to get back to building more of these reactors,
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:43.220]   there's no reason to think
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.180]   that if we had a scaled cluster of reactors,
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.420]   five to 10 reactors that you wanted to bring on
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.020]   over a 10 year period of time,
[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.460]   that you wouldn't drive down the overall cost of the reactor.
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:53.300]   - Perhaps.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:57.340]   There's not a lot of proof points of us building
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.700]   either at a federal or state level,
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:04.980]   big projects at very low cost in modern history.
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.060]   There were some, there's famous things.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.300]   - But if you think about infrastructure,
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.260]   most of it is one-off, right?
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:13.300]   You build a bridge somewhere,
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.340]   then you build a bridge in a different city.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.980]   And it seems like the other issue is
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:20.820]   the South Koreans are not only building them for themselves,
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.100]   they're building them for export, right?
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.860]   And again, that just gets back to this scale mentality
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.340]   of building these plants.
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:32.140]   But to be clear, the idea that we're gonna bring the cost
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:35.500]   of building one of these things down by 70%,
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.900]   which is kind of the target needed to make this competitive
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.420]   in the open market with gas and everything else,
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:43.340]   I think is very, it's hard to see.
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.420]   - And this is a good point.
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:47.820]   The landed price points in Korea and China
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:50.940]   are very similar to the landed price points
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:55.660]   of other renewables and things, just on a CapEx bill.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:59.140]   But ours isn't because ours is three or four X,
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.660]   the global best.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.740]   I wanna talk, I'm gonna go back to the South Korea thing
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.820]   because you brought up the IP issue.
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:11.500]   I'm not convinced that it's helping us any
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.780]   to sit around and cry about whether China
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.860]   or South Korea used our IP.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:19.020]   And if anything, I think,
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.180]   and I've mentioned this on the pod before,
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:26.020]   I think this anti-Chinese mentality is a little nuts
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.660]   because if you look at low-cost EVs,
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.380]   if you look at their subway stations,
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:34.980]   if you look at, they're leading us in many areas.
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:38.260]   And we have this holier-than-thou, you know,
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:43.060]   attitude that America's the best and that we're the leader
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.540]   and we're being passed.
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.980]   Like, I would say landed cost of energy
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:50.860]   is the data point you should measure most.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.980]   And if they're four X where we are,
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.940]   I would say we should have the alarm bells ring
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:57.820]   going, what the hell is going on?
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.460]   Why are we so far behind?
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.860]   And I think it's a little bit of a crutch to lean on
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:04.220]   and say, oh, they built it on our technology.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.140]   One of the things I learned about the Korea situation,
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.180]   so they're trying to export it.
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:12.780]   Westinghouse, who was the company
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.620]   that originally designed Level 3 fission in the US
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.820]   is suing to try and prevent them
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.340]   from delivering to Czechoslovakia.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:24.300]   And, you know, we talked to Maureen
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:29.100]   about how the different nuclear plant operators all share
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.020]   and that we're kind of all in this together, right?
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.820]   And if climate change is a global problem
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.460]   and we all want it solved,
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.340]   like, we should want everyone to win.
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:42.660]   Like, we shouldn't be jealous that China's doing that.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:46.820]   And so for me, you know, I ask all the AI bots,
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.460]   you know, do you think there's any chance
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:51.740]   we would license something from South Korea?
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.220]   They all said, no, there's no chance we would do that.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.860]   And that's the kind of a middle blocker,
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.180]   like Trump derangement syndrome or something.
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:01.980]   Like, if Korea could help us deliver a planet,
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:05.820]   2.5 billion per gigawatt, why wouldn't we want that?
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.740]   And so I just-
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.780]   - I mean, we invited TSMC into Arizona
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:09.860]   to help us build chips.
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.860]   - I know, but if you have this attitude,
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:12.860]   they took it from us,
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.060]   then you don't get into that right mindset.
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.780]   So I just think that's an important kind of thing
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.620]   to think about.
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:21.620]   We would all be better off if nuclear energy were cheaper
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.860]   for everyone on the planet.
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:23.700]   - Right.
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:28.700]   - And a lot of the political disagreements that lead to war,
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:32.180]   a lot of people believe are tied to energy costs
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.420]   and energy availability.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.940]   So you might reduce that as well.
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:40.620]   - I think one of the reasons we're so focused on China
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:46.020]   is what started this conversation for you and I
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:50.580]   was when you model out the need for data center capacity
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:53.100]   over the course of the next five to 10 years,
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:57.100]   you realize for the first time in really two decades,
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:01.620]   the US's need to grow its baseload power generation
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.100]   is going to go up significantly,
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.060]   significantly faster than it has
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.500]   over the course of the last two decades.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:11.060]   - And this has become a standard topic of discussion
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:11.940]   in Wall Street.
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.140]   Everyone's talking about this.
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:17.660]   - Energy, reliable, always on energy, right?
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:21.100]   In fact, most data centers wanna build right next
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.020]   to the source of energy.
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:23.940]   - Right.
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:25.820]   - That is the primitive to AI.
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:30.500]   And we do believe that AI supremacy
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.660]   really goes to national security.
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:36.780]   So the reason I believe that we're seeing finally
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:40.500]   some bipartisan movement in Washington
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.980]   and around the country, frankly, on this issue,
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:45.740]   is people realize how inextricably
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.380]   these things are tied together.
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.780]   So the reason I'm worried about China
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:50.980]   taking the lead in nuclear
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:54.380]   is not just that they have more nuclear power plants
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:55.220]   in the United States,
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:58.540]   but what it enables them to do down the line
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.260]   around AI and everything else.
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:03.340]   Because if you are the low cost power provider
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:05.140]   in the world, right?
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.500]   Then you're going to be able to build bigger data centers
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:09.980]   that power bigger AI clusters, et cetera.
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.900]   And I'm not certain that that leads to better AI,
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.580]   but there's a reasonable enough chance
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:18.260]   that you don't wanna give them that unilateral option.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:22.500]   - I think even if you don't take that lens,
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:26.300]   you say to yourself, if we can't fix this problem,
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.260]   but other countries can,
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:32.300]   you may be through being imported by South Korea,
[00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.300]   then it becomes a competitive weapon for those countries.
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:39.980]   And just as you might put a manufacturing plant
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:43.900]   in Mexico or Vietnam or Czechoslovakia,
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.700]   there's no reason why a data center
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.260]   can't live there as well.
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:51.940]   And quite frankly, it's easier to drop a fiber optic cable
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:56.940]   from Mexico to America than it is to move goods by truck.
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:58.820]   - So should we be trying to build,
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:02.820]   cooperate with the Mexican government
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.860]   and build AP 1000s just over the border in Mexico?
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:07.660]   - I think we should be open-minded
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:11.620]   to the fact that the world needs this technology
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:15.100]   and that if they get it, it's good too.
[00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.660]   If Czechoslovakia gets it, it's good too.
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:19.540]   This was my main point about like,
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.020]   I just don't think having an attitude that,
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:25.780]   oh, that's ours or I don't even don't love the,
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.260]   it's a race and they're winning.
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.460]   I think everyone should be winning in this area.
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:34.300]   Like once again, if you care about global climate change,
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.300]   like it's a global problem, everyone should.
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.540]   I mean, it wasn't that long ago
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:41.860]   that with this same kind of anti-China attitude,
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:43.300]   we sat here and said,
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:45.660]   oh, we're gonna clean up our pollution,
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:48.260]   but look at those guys and we're pointing our finger.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:50.700]   Now we wake up and they're landed costs
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:53.020]   of nuclear energy is one fourth of ours.
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.900]   And like, who are we pointing a finger at?
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:55.980]   Like, you know.
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:51:00.580]   - Yeah, I think there is, I was reading,
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:02.100]   I think I got the name correct.
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:05.060]   Professor Brunjerno from MIT is the director
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:08.220]   for the Center of Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems.
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:10.580]   You know, he said, China's now the de facto world leader
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.860]   in nuclear technology, right?
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.020]   And it's not because they're smarter, they're better,
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:19.020]   but it's simply because they made it a national priority,
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:22.100]   right, that they were going to build these plants.
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:26.060]   And when you do that, you innovate, right?
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.980]   And when I look at the moratorium that has largely existed
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.260]   in the United States over the last two decades,
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:35.020]   you tell me, if you had the Elon Musk of the United States
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.540]   working on fission over the course
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.500]   of the last two decades, right,
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.940]   we would be light years ahead of where we are
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:44.220]   from an innovation perspective.
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:48.060]   And maybe that's a decent segue to talk about, you know,
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:51.820]   what some of these gen four advanced nuclear reactors
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.780]   look like, because you and I, again,
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:55.980]   are talking about generation three
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.420]   or generation three plus reactors.
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:01.540]   The AP-1000 is kind of the standard reactor
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:05.380]   that's, you know, that's being built today.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.540]   But whether you're talking about TerraPower,
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:10.740]   these alternative sources of cooling that are being built,
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.860]   I think we have five or six or seven of these
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:18.100]   that are authorized under kind of the developmental,
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.860]   you know, regime in the United States
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.740]   that are hoping to come online over the course
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:24.020]   of the next five to seven years.
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.780]   For the first time in four decades,
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.780]   an American company broke ground on a next-generation
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.300]   nuclear power plant in the US.
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:34.540]   The company behind the new technology is TerraPower,
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.540]   and it's backed by billionaire Bill Gates.
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:39.500]   Nuclear power is carbon-free,
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:42.220]   which means it doesn't emit the greenhouse gases
[00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:44.380]   scientists link to climate change.
[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:46.620]   And Gates is building a plant in Wyoming
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:50.660]   at a cost he estimates will be $10 billion.
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:53.740]   TerraPower's new reactor uses liquid sodium
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:55.140]   rather than water for cooling,
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:57.900]   which the company says makes nuclear power
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.540]   cheaper, safer, and more efficient.
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.940]   If we all agree that the 94 reactors
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:05.980]   that we have currently online, we should keep online.
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:09.420]   The question I have, Bill, is should we be looking
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:13.620]   to build more of the Gen 3 fission reactors,
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.900]   or should we leapfrog and be, you know,
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.180]   there seems to be a lot of energy,
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.380]   at least in Silicon Valley and, you know,
[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:23.340]   in Washington, Bill Gates, behind these Gen 4 reactors,
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.620]   where would you spend your time and energy?
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:27.740]   - Yeah, so, I mean, my first reaction would be
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.780]   it shouldn't be an either/or, like we should be doing both.
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.260]   And I think that's what's happening, so that's fine.
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:37.660]   I would also say if, one of the big issues
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:40.340]   for both level three and four,
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:43.340]   what we could call the futures technologies,
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:47.580]   is utilities having the gumption
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:51.140]   to put the CapEx and invest.
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.660]   If you start, and I heard this from multiple people
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:58.660]   that I talked to, utilities are inherently conservative.
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:53:59.700]   - Yes.
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.140]   - Like Wall Street investors think of them
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:06.820]   as these stable things you buy that don't move around a lot,
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:07.660]   but just have a stick.
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:09.700]   - I think the CEO of PG&E recently said,
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:12.620]   who owns Diablo, recently said on a podcast
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:15.340]   they have no interest in investing in SMRs.
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:17.740]   They said, "We're gonna let risk capital invest
[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:21.180]   "in small nuclear reactors, and if they work, right,
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:22.060]   "then we'll consider it,
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:23.620]   "but we're not gonna be the risk capital."
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:26.460]   - It affects both of them, and maybe that's changing.
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:29.860]   When I first heard about Constellation Energy Group,
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.660]   which operates a bunch of nuclear reactors here in the US,
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:34.660]   I reached out to 'em, and I asked 'em,
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:36.060]   "Are you doing anything new?
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.060]   "Are you innovating?
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:38.660]   "Are you doing a new plant?"
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:42.020]   They said, "No, no, no, we just operate these old ones."
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:45.100]   Now there's a rumor that they're talking to Threema Island
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:49.980]   about restarting that, and so maybe these changes
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:51.820]   in attitude are gonna tip 'em in.
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:55.180]   If, I say this with a ton of confidence,
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:57.540]   even though it's unprovable,
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.740]   if these utilities could snap their fingers
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:04.900]   and have fission level three online at--
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.220]   - Competitive rates.
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:08.220]   - Korea and China price points,
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.180]   I think they'd be turning 'em on.
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:10.020]   - Of course, of course.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:15.020]   - So there's a huge difference between 2.2 or 2.3 and 13.
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.700]   Like, there's just a huge difference.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:20.460]   So if that problem were solvable,
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.460]   I think they'd be investing more.
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:24.420]   But I don't know if that's solvable, I really don't.
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.100]   - To answer my own question,
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:28.460]   or perhaps push you a little further on this,
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:31.300]   so if you listen to Gates talk about the reason
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:34.580]   for alternative to gen three power plants,
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:38.740]   is they effectively said the gen three design
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:43.540]   was a massively complex engineering solution
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:46.900]   to the safety challenges of the plants
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:48.940]   that came before it, okay?
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:52.060]   And so rather than designing with perhaps elegance,
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:54.820]   like passive cooling,
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:57.100]   they came up with very complex
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:01.420]   and expensive engineered solutions to those problems.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:03.420]   Now, the great thing about the engineered solutions
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.100]   is they work, right?
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:07.660]   We know they work, they're repeatable processes,
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:09.100]   and we've driven down the cost
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:10.300]   in some of these other places.
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.940]   But if you look at the gen four reactors,
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.980]   they're much more modular.
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:18.500]   Some of 'em can be produced in factories.
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:22.580]   A lot of 'em have sodium or alternative mechanisms
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:24.100]   for passive cooling.
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.900]   Is that perhaps, again, when we think about the cost
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:30.420]   of driving down these plants,
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:33.860]   it does seem to me that we can't magically snap our fingers
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.100]   and make labor costs in the United States go down.
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:38.500]   We can't snap our fingers and make,
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:39.820]   say we're gonna scale this up
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:41.980]   and make all the regulatory stuff better.
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:46.300]   So a leapfrog would be just build a smaller, simpler plant.
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:50.420]   - Yeah, I mean, China, there's a new plant in China,
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:53.180]   I probably can't pronounce it right, Shidao,
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:54.660]   that is level four,
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:57.340]   but it came on at a price way above Vogel.
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:58.420]   So like-
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:01.060]   - Yeah, but any new plant, any novel thing
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:03.500]   is gonna be a lot more expensive on unit one
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:04.340]   than it's gonna be on unit two.
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:06.140]   - You know, they used to call,
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:10.340]   I've heard people refer to modern day semiconductor investing
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:11.780]   as a sport of kings,
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:14.020]   'cause you're 50 million to first take that.
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.580]   If that's a sport of kings,
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.180]   this is a sport of emperors.
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:21.740]   You may be multi billions to first revenue.
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:26.740]   And so good thing we have Bill Gates like emperors
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:28.380]   that wanna make this stuff work.
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:31.100]   Yeah, let's dive in on SMRs for a second.
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:35.620]   So I'm sure the at least high level pitch
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:38.060]   you would hear from all of the SMR vendors
[00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:41.220]   is one of the reasons that level three fission
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:44.940]   is so expensive is it's a huge infrastructure project
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:47.740]   and the US isn't good at those anymore.
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:51.180]   And if you could build this thing in a factory
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:53.780]   and then ship it and deliver it where it's used
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:57.860]   and there's talks of, oh, I could take an old coal plant
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:00.540]   and put an SMR in there, several of them.
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:03.060]   And now the transmission lines are all in the right place.
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:06.380]   And I get, and to what you just said,
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:08.620]   and then I can repeat it.
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:11.500]   Then the first unit might not be competitive,
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:13.180]   but the hundredth unit might be,
[00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:16.580]   'cause I could get into more of an automation factory thing
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:19.620]   and get out of this infrastructure build problem
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:21.300]   that we're no good at in the US.
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:23.020]   That is the argument.
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:28.020]   I think another super valid argument is the Navy.
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:32.460]   And one of the links we will provide is a 92 page PDF
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:36.860]   on the miraculous success of the Naval Nuclear Program,
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:40.460]   which are in essence SMRs that already exist
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:43.860]   on a hundred different vessels, some submarines,
[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:46.220]   some carriers in the US Navy.
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:49.540]   And the track record is phenomenal.
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.980]   The costs are pretty interesting,
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:54.140]   especially since they've never been applied
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:56.620]   at a commercial level.
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:59:00.500]   And so there's reason to believe in this.
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:03.340]   The problem, I think the overwhelming problem
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:08.020]   is that the utilities aren't really,
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:10.300]   they're not acting like, say,
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:14.300]   Google and Amazon are buying Nvidia clusters
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:15.620]   where, oh, we're gonna put them up.
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:17.980]   And they're more conservative.
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:20.700]   They want the startup to bear most of the risk.
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:24.420]   There's an agreement called a power purchase agreement
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:27.980]   where the utility says, oh yeah, I'll buy it from you
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.980]   if you can deliver it to me at this price,
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:32.580]   where they know their margin.
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:35.420]   And the startup's completely on the hook
[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:36.860]   for whether they can get there or not.
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:39.340]   And we've already had one colossal miss
[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:41.340]   with a startup called NuScale
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:43.100]   that had one of these agreements in place
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:46.500]   and they got time to qualify.
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:50.060]   And the utility went, I'm out.
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:52.860]   And NuScale had to start laying people off.
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:53.780]   And it's just tough.
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:56.860]   And the other tough part, the NRC,
[00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:58.260]   which we haven't talked much about,
[00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:02.300]   but the regulatory commission here in the US is fee-based.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:05.180]   And all the people that are playing in this market
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:08.060]   I've talked to say you're probably 60 million
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.220]   to first approval.
[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:12.700]   Just on fees, the startup's gonna pay to the NRC
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:15.020]   to tell them what they're doing is okay.
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.660]   Once again, sport of emperors.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:21.540]   - Yes, well, and that brings us back to,
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:25.380]   why did you and I really amp up this conversation?
[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:28.420]   Because of Nvidia, because of Meta,
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.300]   because of Google, because of Microsoft,
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:32.380]   the power needs that they have.
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.820]   - And maybe those companies are the ones
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:35.660]   that need to kind of--
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.020]   - I mean, if they're spending $250 billion a year
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:40.420]   on CapEx associated with AI,
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.580]   that is emperor level spending, right?
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.700]   - Maybe they need to be the ones underwriting
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:45.860]   the risk on the SMR.
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:50.100]   - And I also think what they can do, Bill, how about this?
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:54.260]   Why don't the hyperscalers form a consortium, okay?
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.660]   And they go to Washington and they say,
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:59.460]   "Hey, we'll put up X amount
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:03.180]   "in order to build some AP 1000s," right?
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:07.340]   Or daisy chain a bunch of these SMRs together, right?
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.780]   I'm talking about a new type of project
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:12.260]   in partnership with Washington, DC,
[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:14.660]   where there's a mutual need.
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:17.220]   They have the capital, public-private partnership
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.300]   to get this going.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.300]   Because honestly, as I sit here today,
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:22.020]   take Tiablo Canyon.
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.260]   They built two nuclear reactors here.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:28.620]   You know, this site was provisioned for six,
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:30.300]   for six reactors.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:34.220]   I could imagine if you had four more reactors sitting here,
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.780]   right, if you could land them at the right price,
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.300]   you could have one reactor for Meta,
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.860]   one for Amazon, one for Microsoft, one for NVIDIA.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:45.660]   You could have the data center sitting right next to them.
[01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.500]   It does seem--
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.140]   - By the way, I ran some math on the Diablo dollars,
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.500]   just 'cause it's interesting.
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.460]   So in the mid 80s dollars,
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.180]   the plant was built for 5.5 billion.
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.500]   So right around 2.4.
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:03.100]   Unfortunately, in today's dollars, that's 6.4.
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:07.180]   But 6.4 is still half of 13, which is Vogel.
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:10.580]   And so, yeah, just interesting.
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:12.540]   - I mean, you know, again,
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:15.100]   we know the reasons why they're not coming online
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:15.940]   at that price.
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.620]   So the question is whether or not you can change
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:19.460]   those dynamics through some of the things
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.940]   that we talked about.
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.580]   I do think these Gen 4 reactors,
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:26.260]   there's room, you know, I, like you,
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:28.420]   believe it's an all of the above strategy.
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:31.540]   We should have the large Gen 4 reactors,
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:34.100]   but we also should do this small modular stuff.
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.980]   We basically have a hundred floating SMRs
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.900]   in our naval fleet.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.260]   You know, just imagine if you just took those ships
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:43.420]   and dropped them on land and, you know,
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.900]   set some transmission lines up again.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:49.900]   What's great about those reactors is, you know, again,
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:53.060]   part of what we need to do is get the flywheel going
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.180]   on the marketplace.
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:03:00.020]   Not everybody needs, not every situation needs 1.5 gigs.
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:00.860]   - That's true.
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:03.340]   - Right, a hundred megawatts out of a small nuclear reactor
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:07.340]   may be a perfect fit for some of these smaller solutions.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:09.700]   - Well, let's talk about possible solutions.
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:10.540]   - Okay.
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:11.780]   - Not that we get to decide.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:16.460]   And I'll start with on the level three side
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:18.300]   and then let's go to the SMR side.
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:21.780]   But, you know, the first thing that popped in my mind
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:26.780]   when I see how far behind China and Korea we are is,
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:30.460]   like I said, I'm shocked no one's shocked.
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:35.460]   But if someone inside of Washington is like,
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:37.780]   oh my God, we have to fix this.
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:40.460]   The first thing that comes to my mind,
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:42.620]   and maybe this could be applied to both SMRs
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:46.780]   and level three scale out, is we could choose
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:49.340]   to do something more like a Manhattan project
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.060]   or a NASA project.
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.020]   And you hinted at this already,
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:55.820]   where you get the best and brightest people,
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:59.180]   you put them somewhere on the side,
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:01.780]   you give them the ability to do things
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:03.340]   they couldn't do before.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:08.260]   Like re-imagine the NRC from the ground up.
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:12.060]   You give them a goal like the Manhattan project
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:17.060]   and NASA had to deliver nuclear at a competitive rate
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:21.500]   in the US, you know, and come hell or high water.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.660]   Now, we haven't done one of those things
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:25.340]   since those two that I mentioned,
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:28.140]   but we were pretty successful when we did those.
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.740]   You know, and I think when you have an industry
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:32.700]   that's this important to the country
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:36.620]   and this highly regulated, it is kind of an exception
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:39.420]   where you say maybe the free market's not the right--
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:42.700]   - I mean, it's pretty clear to me
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:46.140]   that because of the regulation,
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:48.420]   which again, I'm sure we could regulate
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:50.420]   this industry better, but you're happy
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:53.420]   the industry has a lot of regulation, okay?
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.940]   It's incredibly safe.
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:58.860]   But given that burden of regulation,
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.260]   it does drive up the cost
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:02.300]   relative to alternative solutions.
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.300]   And the United States is just incredibly lucky.
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.380]   We have an abundance of natural gas.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.340]   So left purely to market forces,
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:10.140]   if you don't subsidize any of this stuff,
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.940]   we wouldn't have any solar, we wouldn't have any wind,
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:14.340]   we wouldn't have, you know,
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.700]   we're not gonna have the investment required
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.140]   to bring on these new plants.
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.540]   So I do think it has to be a partnership
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:21.940]   where the government is willing.
[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:26.300]   Now, listen, what we're doing in the IRA with chips,
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.740]   we've decided building chips in the United States
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:30.100]   is a strategic priority.
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.300]   You and I have debated whether or not
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:33.820]   that will be successful.
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.220]   We happen to both be on the same side of the agreement
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.100]   that that's going to be very challenged
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.460]   in the United States, but the United States--
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:43.300]   - They did in the recent week, including Intel stock price.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.860]   - But the United States government
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.820]   is absolutely committed, you know, to that path.
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.620]   I think nuclear is at least as important.
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.660]   - But they didn't go as far as we're talking about.
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:54.500]   They just did loan programs and stuff.
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:57.380]   I'm saying, if you did a Manhattan Project
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:59.260]   or NASA scale thing,
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:02.780]   where you're trying to redo everything,
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:05.540]   not just provide loans or incentives.
[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:07.940]   And by the way, there is, I think, an imperative,
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:12.940]   just as a quick side, to at least make sure nuclear
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.500]   is not disadvantaged relative to wind and solar.
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:21.500]   It has operating efficiency and this durability
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.060]   and this always-on piece
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.260]   that make it so much better than those.
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.140]   And right now, I think it actually
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:29.900]   has less incentive programs.
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.580]   And I'm not sure that's smart.
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:33.900]   - If you look at, you know,
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:36.220]   I saw this mashup the other day on Twitter.
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:42.420]   You know, it's Trump and Biden and Elon and Bill Gates
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:45.860]   folks on both sides of the political divide, right?
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.740]   The one thing that's very clear right now
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.860]   is that both sides of the political divide
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:51.460]   have come together on this issue.
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:54.500]   - Take nuclear power, biggest source of clean energy.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.100]   - There's no question that there are benefits.
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:00.420]   - Our nuclear energy sector produces clean, renewable
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:02.660]   and emissions-free energy.
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:06.620]   - In Germany, they closed the nuclear power plants.
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:08.300]   They have to keep coal burning.
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:10.380]   They said no to clean energy.
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.220]   And they said yes to fossil fuels.
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:14.820]   And we in California, we have a nuclear power plant
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:17.380]   called Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant.
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.420]   9% of clean energy.
[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:20.900]   So why would we shut it down?
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:24.620]   - There's a new effort to increase the amount of energy
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.420]   obtained from nuclear power.
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:28.500]   It's a better form of energy
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.020]   because it doesn't have greenhouse gas emission.
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.460]   - It's crazy to shut down nuclear power plants.
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:34.660]   I can't emphasize enough.
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:36.620]   Please do not shut down the nuclear power plants.
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:39.660]   Please reopen the ones that have been shut.
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.980]   This is total madness to shut them down.
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:43.580]   - Total madness.
[01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:46.700]   - Think about where we were just, you know,
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:49.780]   like Maureen shared with us today, just 10 years ago.
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:50.980]   I mean, there was a moratorium.
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.060]   They were decommissioning plants.
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:56.540]   So I think we do have a lot of forward progress.
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:57.580]   And I think we need to come up
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:58.780]   with that statement of principles.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:00.620]   No more decommissioning.
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:03.060]   Bring online the plants that we've decommissioned
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:05.340]   that are easy enough to bring online, right?
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:06.700]   Figure out whether or not,
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:10.100]   I think there's a startup maybe called The Nuclear Company
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:13.540]   that's trying to build six or seven of the AP1000s.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.060]   You know, maybe there are some companies
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.420]   that we can get behind
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.500]   that are going to go cluster build
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.260]   some of the Gen 3 reactors.
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:22.460]   You know, maybe there are things the government can do
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:24.700]   to, you know, streamline that process,
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:27.220]   provide some credits, make that process work.
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:30.580]   And then I think, you know, letting the market work
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:33.020]   by removing some of the regulatory burdens.
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:35.460]   We've already done this through a lot of legislation
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:38.180]   at the federal level to let these Gen 4 reactors
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.740]   at least come online, experiment,
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.940]   see whether or not they're going to work.
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:43.580]   That feels like a pretty good solution.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:48.100]   - I think it's tough, you know, on the NRC front,
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.060]   two of the links we're gonna provide
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.700]   are a presentation from the head of the NRC
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:54.980]   and a podcast with the head of the NRC.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:57.940]   And one thing that becomes very apparent is like,
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:00.220]   he's like considers it a win that we've gone
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.380]   from a negative reduction
[01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:04.940]   to just keeping everything online.
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:07.020]   And we're sitting here staring at China going,
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:08.300]   why aren't we doing this?
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.860]   So they're just not in that mindset.
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:13.140]   And they've been around a long time.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:17.020]   And I don't, I think there's red tape is red tape.
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:19.220]   And I just think that, you know,
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.620]   you're probably at a place where you might want to send
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:25.940]   a bunch of people off in a room and like zero base it,
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:26.780]   you know?
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:28.460]   - Well, I think this is, I mean, again,
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:33.140]   companies get built where markets are created.
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:35.500]   There's a lot of growth domestically in China.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.260]   So there's a lot of this stuff coming online.
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.060]   - But they don't have the history of red tape that we have.
[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:40.900]   - I agree with that.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:43.140]   In South Korea, they're exporting.
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:45.980]   Well, we have export controls in the United States,
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:47.820]   which are preventing a lot of these companies
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:49.020]   from building and exporting.
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:52.180]   So like, again, we could change those export controls
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:55.580]   and perhaps build a domestic export industry,
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:56.500]   you know, for nuclear.
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.100]   Why do you do that?
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:00.100]   Because it builds the supply chains.
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:03.820]   It builds the resilience that benefits you domestically.
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:04.860]   - I'm a little skeptical.
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:09.660]   Like, I uncovered this document
[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:14.020]   from the Idaho National Laboratory, I think it's called,
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:18.420]   which is a separate nuclear arm of the US government
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.220]   from the NRC.
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:24.060]   And they recommended 30 things to change about the NRC.
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:25.340]   And I'm sitting here thinking,
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.340]   "Wow, that's a lot of things you would change."
[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:30.100]   And people can go find this document.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:35.100]   But my guess is, even if Congress got behind this document
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.580]   and said, "You should change these things,"
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.980]   what would happen is, over five years,
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:40.940]   they'd change 20% of them.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.460]   They wouldn't change all of them.
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:45.900]   And I don't think the impacts, we're at a 4X cost.
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.300]   I don't think you get there, you know?
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.060]   And so, you know, I mentioned this earlier,
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:54.500]   but Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor,
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:58.860]   who everyone praises because this bridge went down on I-95,
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:00.660]   and he got it back up in 12 days.
[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:01.980]   - Yeah, how'd he do it?
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:06.820]   - He took all the regulation and lawsuits off the table.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:10.020]   And so, we have to recognize that one of the reasons
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:11.420]   we can't build infrastructure
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:14.580]   in the California high-speed train thing is where it is,
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:19.580]   is because we've indoctrinated ourselves in red tape,
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:23.260]   both with regard to regulation and litigation.
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.740]   And if you want to go build
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:28.060]   this next generation level three plant,
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:30.180]   I think you've got to rewrite the regulation
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:34.860]   from zero ground up, like, make it thinner and tighter.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:38.740]   And two, I think we've gotten to the point
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.380]   where we got to say, "This is so important,
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.260]   "you can't sue these people."
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:43.740]   Like, the government's doing this.
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:46.380]   - And that, to me, seems perhaps even more important, Bill,
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:50.140]   because in South Korea, their national regulation
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:53.180]   and the regulatory body that oversees it all
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:56.620]   is modeled on the U.S., okay?
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:59.300]   - So, that, to me, doesn't explain
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:01.540]   why we have this massive price differential,
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:04.380]   but I do think the litigation environment,
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:06.060]   all the other things,
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:09.100]   the fact that we have this dual level of litigation,
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:12.380]   and then, ironically, here at Diablo Canyon,
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:16.460]   you say, "Why, what was one of the leading forces
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:18.340]   "that caused this place to get decommissioned
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:19.340]   "in the first place?"
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:23.700]   It's groups euphemistically called Friends of the Earth,
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:26.340]   right, who sue them at every different stage,
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.380]   who turn public support against them.
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:33.180]   Ironically, right, if you decommission Diablo,
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:34.780]   you know what the state does?
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:37.940]   It imports more coal-produced power.
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:38.900]   - We know this.
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.460]   - And yet, Friends of the Earth are lobbying for this.
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:43.060]   - And that doesn't exist in China.
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:43.900]   - Right.
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.700]   - So, to a certain extent, you've built your own problem.
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:49.540]   - Well, listen, I would much rather deal
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:54.540]   with the downsides of a free system,
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:58.500]   where, you know, you have the market competing,
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.780]   but I will say that when you have this much regulation,
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.740]   right, the government has chosen to be involved.
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:06.220]   You no longer have an unfettered market, right?
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.100]   So market forces break down.
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.380]   Clearly, they've broken down here,
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:13.060]   and I think now we see the strategic priority
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:15.260]   to get, you know, to get behind this.
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:16.900]   It's been a heck of a learning.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.220]   - Let me riff on one other thing you said
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.100]   before we wrap up.
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:23.140]   On the SMR front, I like your idea
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:24.500]   of these people getting together.
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.660]   You know, we've talked about Facebook's
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:29.620]   Open Compute Project, where they open-sourced
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.700]   all the elements of their data center,
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:35.180]   and we heard from Maureen that a lot of these operators
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.420]   get together and share best practices,
[01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:42.420]   and it strikes me that creating an IP-free world
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:48.300]   for these people to live in is beneficial to the utilities.
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:51.140]   It should give them more confidence in what they're doing.
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:54.700]   I wonder if, I ask all the AIs,
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:57.580]   has anyone tried to commercialize
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:00.660]   the learnings of the Navy, and they said no.
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:02.340]   Everywhere else said no. - In the SMRs.
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:05.220]   - And so maybe there's an opportunity there, right?
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:07.260]   The government, why not take some of the--
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:09.100]   - That would be the coordinating function
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.260]   if the government could create kind of that
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:13.980]   open-source standard for the AP1000, right?
[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:15.460]   - Or for the SMR one, maybe,
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:18.340]   by leveraging what's been done in the Navy
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:21.180]   and maybe getting these hyperscalers behind it,
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:24.460]   and maybe that's a mini version of a Manhattan Project,
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:28.340]   but boy, it seems like there's an opportunity there,
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:33.340]   and the reason, and people will be very upset
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:35.540]   that as a capitalist I'm suggesting this,
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:39.300]   the reason to make it IP-free is to get everyone
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:41.120]   working on the same platform,
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.680]   to remove single-source dependency risk,
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:46.460]   and to get the utilities confidence
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.820]   that this thing's gonna be successful
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:51.540]   and gonna go forward, and to get everyone behind it.
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:54.980]   So do the Linux of SMRs.
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:59.980]   - And by the way, again, this is about buying time, right?
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:03.140]   Like if we telescope way out,
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:06.740]   and I think Elon's thought about this as much as anyone,
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:08.620]   he said ultimately the sun's the source
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:11.220]   of all of our power, right?
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:13.820]   The problem is we don't have the technologies today
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:16.420]   to store it as efficiently as we need to
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:18.580]   in order to provide all of our energy, okay?
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:21.780]   So I don't know whether it's 25, 50, 75 years,
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:24.580]   but we're going to have to bridge these technologies.
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:27.840]   We have a clean energy that we invented, right,
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.700]   that currently is powering, you know,
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:32.140]   it's 20% of our total base load power,
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:33.920]   it's 50% of our clean energy.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.740]   If there's one thing I've taken away
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.580]   from what we've studied over the course of the last 10 weeks
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:40.740]   is that we have 94 plants in this country,
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:43.220]   and we should not be decommissioning any of them.
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:45.940]   They all have much longer useful lives
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:47.100]   than I ever thought about.
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:51.260]   At 60, 70 years old, they still run safely
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.620]   provided that you do the proper maintenance
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:55.500]   and all this stuff to these plants,
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.820]   which frankly is new news to me.
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:58.660]   Yeah, me too, me too.
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:00.180]   And I think terrific news.
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:02.420]   And it's also very clear that we can build more.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:05.260]   I mean, Vogel, yes, we had big cost overruns,
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.180]   but we have the capacity in this country
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.140]   to build more of these Gen 3 reactors.
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.380]   We have a lot of vibrancy and activity going on
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.740]   on the Gen 4 side.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:15.660]   We've got a lot of bipartisan support now in Congress.
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:19.700]   And so I come out of this a little bit more optimistic,
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.180]   but in the state of California,
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:23.260]   we are sitting here at Diablo.
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:25.780]   I would love to see Governor Newsom
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:28.320]   in the course of the next 24 months
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.700]   announce that he's gonna extend the license here
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:33.140]   for another 15 years.
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:37.900]   I mean, this seems to me to be a crown jewel
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:41.900]   of California's leadership on things like AI,
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:44.540]   our ability to produce this type of energy.
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:45.380]   It makes no sense.
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:46.940]   Take this off the table
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:50.380]   and let's get to working on what we need to do next
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:53.300]   in order to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:57.620]   and frankly, drive up the power generation in the state
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:00.900]   that we're gonna need to power the economy and AI.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:05.460]   Yeah, and I would urge those that care
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:08.540]   that if you want to really meaningfully
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.820]   keep up with China and Korea,
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:15.460]   that one, we should quit vilifying them
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:18.340]   and start respecting the fact that they're executing
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.700]   at a level above and beyond us.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:23.620]   And then two, consider some type
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:27.580]   of Manhattan Project-like approach
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:29.900]   where you get out of the current environment,
[01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:32.780]   you get a lot of smart people thinking
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:33.940]   from first principles.
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:37.420]   You maybe borrow from what the Navy's done
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:42.220]   and consider open source or IP-free solutions
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:43.700]   to get everybody on the same page.
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:44.580]   Yeah.
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:46.540]   Well, next week or the week after,
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:48.660]   we'll be back to regular programming.
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:50.620]   But this is one of the things you and I wanted to do.
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:53.060]   We wanted to take some deep dives on some topics
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:54.540]   that interested us along the way.
[01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:55.380]   So thanks.
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.900]   And I would encourage people that disagree
[01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:01.060]   and I'm sure many will to reach out.
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:02.260]   Oh, you're gonna hear from 'em.
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:03.100]   I know, I know.
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:04.300]   You're gonna hear from 'em.
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:08.460]   Share your point of view and we will bring that data
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:09.420]   into the discussion.
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:11.180]   But on the flip side,
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.540]   I wanna see more of those "Game Day" posters
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:14.620]   saying, "I love nuclear."
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:17.620]   I'd love to see people energized around the topic.
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.300]   I'd love to see the presidential candidates
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:21.420]   talking about the topic.
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:24.380]   Well, I'm headed to Ann Arbor this weekend
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:27.060]   where I suspect "Game Day" will be.
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:28.660]   Will we see some more signs?
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:31.860]   So maybe I can show off with the signs.
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.540]   We'll see if I have time to do that.
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:34.380]   All right, man.
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:35.220]   Have a good time.
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:36.060]   Great seeing you. Yeah, take care.
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:36.900]   Bye-bye.
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:39.500]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:47.340]   As a reminder to everybody,
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:49.500]   just our opinions, not investment advice.
