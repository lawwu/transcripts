[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:29.060]   - Okay everybody, so this is a real
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.060]   honor, so this is an incredible founder success story.
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.220]   Just your average everyday CEO founder
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.680]   of an $82 billion public company sitting here.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.820]   (laughing)
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.940]   So Toby and I met a few years ago.
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.900]   His, the origin story of Shopify is pretty legendary,
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.900]   which is that he was in Whistler snowboarding.
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.340]   He met his future wife there, Canadian.
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.940]   They moved to Germany.
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.060]   Toby started a store to sell the snowboards.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.580]   Then moved to Ottawa, my hometown.
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.180]   Couple people here from Ottawa.
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.020]   - That's one door.
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.720]   - I think you're one of the first developers
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.420]   of Ruby actually, that really commercialized.
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.040]   And Toby built a website to sell snowboards,
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.260]   but then abstracted that, started to sell the software
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.900]   that sold the snowboards.
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.900]   And fast forward, that is what Shopify has become.
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.460]   And it's been quite an incredible success story.
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.020]   A, because you were able to raise a lot of money
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.980]   building a business in Ottawa.
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.140]   B, because then you took it public on the NASDAQ.
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.180]   C, you got a lot of COVID tailwinds.
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.760]   D, you had to deal with COVID headwinds.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.740]   But then along the way, you've really been very transparent
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.760]   and honest about the culture of building companies
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.900]   and some of the mistakes you've made, you put out there.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.140]   We're gonna talk about those in a second.
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.580]   But I wanna start with more macro,
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.600]   because we just had Ray on stage.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.900]   You run a big e-commerce business.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.820]   You see consumer spending.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.260]   We know that the consumer is the largest part of GDP.
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.700]   So we must have a sense of whether
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.340]   the consumer is turning over.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.540]   We're seeing all the headlines.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.380]   Is there a recession?
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.200]   Is there not?
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.700]   Hard landing, soft landing.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.980]   Where is the economy from your vantage point?
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.220]   - Yeah, so, I mean, we have an amazing perspective,
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.660]   but I don't think it's a credible witness
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.780]   of the entire economy.
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.060]   It's about half a trillion dollar has been transacted
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.500]   for Shopify in its lifetime.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.940]   And it is really, really fun to do the analysis on it.
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.060]   But like, fundamentally, the products sold on Shopify
[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.140]   are not the products people want,
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.500]   not the products people need.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.260]   And I think this specifically shifts
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.780]   the landscape a little bit.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.640]   What the, and also the other fun thing is
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.920]   it's really good for falsifying bad media narratives.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.900]   Because as always, it's like everyone puts up a chart
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.600]   and says this is the answer.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.920]   And then we get to dig in one level deeper
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.120]   and actually see what are the constituent parts
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.840]   underneath the chart and everything, the story changes.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.040]   So we definitely see people react.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.440]   We know a recession is going on,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.400]   or at least it changes behavior.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   But the particular way in which it changes behavior
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.560]   is probably not a fully explored story
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.960]   outside of Python notebooks and companies like Shopify.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.240]   Because fundamentally what people do is
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.480]   in most categories, they shift one quality level downwards.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.680]   So if you ended up shopping at medium spend level,
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   you might look for fast fashion afterwards.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.480]   In some cases, in our case, this means people
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.520]   might drop out of the Shopify ecosystem
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.240]   and go to purchase maybe clothing at Walmart or something.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.240]   In some cases, at the top of the market,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.680]   like we don't have every LVMH brand on Shopify.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.680]   So people might have purchases there
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.880]   and actually arrive at a challenger brand
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.120]   that is on a platform.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.080]   So honestly, the numbers actually are unchanging.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.760]   The dynamics that make up the numbers
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.960]   are changing from our perspective.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.000]   It's fascinating.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.340]   - Have you, when you think about building the business,
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.840]   I think Stripe's mission is something like
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.680]   to maximize the GDP of the internet.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.640]   Is that roughly your mission as well?
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.120]   - I think second order, yes.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.200]   But honestly, Shopify prays at the altar of entrepreneurship,
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.280]   of people reaching for independence.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.440]   And it's really causing entrepreneurship
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.440]   to be a more casual thing rather than this huge decision.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.200]   Being able to be an entrepreneur in your lunch break
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.120]   so that you can maybe escape a career
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.980]   which you chose for wrong reasons.
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.460]   And you're the kind of people,
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.540]   like you discover, like myself,
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.380]   you're the kind of person
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.500]   who really can't work for other people.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.500]   Retail and building shops and businesses
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.180]   has been around for a long time, thousands of years.
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.640]   It's something, it is one of the most accessible mechanisms
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.220]   of independence.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.980]   And as the internet is just a huge part of economy now,
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.440]   like the ease by which you could start a stand in the bazaar
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.440]   needs to somehow be translated to the digital world.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.000]   And I mean, we talk, you guys talk a lot about policy
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.720]   and incentive systems and what's important.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.440]   I do think the thing that's missing
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.820]   and sometimes in these conversations is friction.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.480]   Like honestly, friction shapes the world so much more
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.280]   than like what laws or what policies
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.880]   is anyone gonna pass to cause more entrepreneurship.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.480]   But if you make it harder, you're gonna get less of it.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.560]   And frankly, most people in the world
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.680]   work for small businesses.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.440]   It's like, depending on where you look, 60 to 80%.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.840]   - So that seems like an incredibly aligning mission.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.480]   We're gonna maximize entrepreneurship,
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.640]   give people independence, a path to escape the drudgery
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.120]   of whatever they may be doing,
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.880]   be in control of their own lives.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.320]   That's very empowering.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.040]   But somewhere along the way, you had to write this memo.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.320]   I mean, incredible memo.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.880]   We are a team and not a family
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.880]   because somewhere along the way,
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.720]   your team got distracted from that mission.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.880]   Can you talk about what happened in that moment
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.720]   and why you had to do it and what it's like afterwards?
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.220]   - You're very kind about that.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.880]   It was internally a memo that I wrote that leaked
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.840]   and apparently struck a chord with a lot of people.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.960]   I think it was actually leaked
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.280]   and packaged as a cancellation attempt on me,
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.920]   which I think backfired, which is really gratifying.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.080]   (audience applauding)
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.200]   - We've got a number of canceled CEOs speaking
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.320]   in the next two days.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.880]   Brian Armstrong, Elon.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.120]   - Yes.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.280]   Well, I mean, I think this is the good news
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.960]   is on the other side, you come out stronger, I think.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.280]   But this was a very confused time,
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.360]   the 2020, 2021 energy period.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.400]   And I mean, everyone wanted to do something.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.040]   And if everyone wants to do something,
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.560]   people will do something.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.880]   And that something might be a really, really,
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.880]   really cool thing, which is with lots of divisiveness.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.660]   And as we all saw, clad in terms that ought to be agreeable.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.840]   Like it sounded pretty good.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.320]   And frankly, I mean,
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.760]   this is maybe not even the topic you're bargaining for,
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.120]   but it's not even,
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.840]   I found myself in this weird situation
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.520]   where I'm generally agreeing with people's diagnosis
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.620]   of all the things that are wrong around me,
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.520]   and definitely disagreeing with literally
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.640]   every proposed way to go about it and solving it.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.800]   And so, there was a lot of distraction.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.960]   And Shopify's always seen itself as a,
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.640]   that's also a canceled term, common carrier, right?
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.840]   Like you had like Elizabeth Warren selling,
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.920]   Marx selling, saying billionaires tears on them,
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.440]   and Trump on the other side selling,
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.480]   whatever Trump was selling.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.360]   And I like that, that's a big tent company.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.680]   That's exactly what you want, right?
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.760]   Because it's a weird idea to segment the internet
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.880]   into these various components.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.400]   And so, then there was another thing
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.480]   that happened, another thing,
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.960]   and we had all these slack channels
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.720]   go way past self-healing,
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.680]   and it ended up becoming this incredible complexity.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.720]   At which point, I wanted to remind everyone,
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.720]   just like, hey,
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.240]   we're trying to cause a particular thing
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.640]   for people to reach for independence.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.280]   It's really not for us to pre-select here.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.800]   Like, let people, as long as they do something legal,
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   we support them.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.840]   And in fact, we are just pushing them
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.380]   from behind via tool.
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.880]   Like, your screwdriver is not gonna tell you
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.080]   that you can't screw something into a wall
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.480]   because you're a Republican voter.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.880]   So, it's just like, simplify this whole goddamn thing
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.240]   and just say, hey, we are showing up
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.800]   to build cool shit.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.520]   We are filling our parts of giving our shit.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.040]   - Is part of that principle,
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.640]   you mentioned LVMH before.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.560]   I actually, if I look and compare your business
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.480]   to LVMH, which I have done,
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.760]   I actually think it's quite similar.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.200]   Because if you talk to Bernard Arnault
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.240]   and you see the infrastructure
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.400]   of what they've built and the abstractions,
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.120]   you've done that, it's just you're 40 years separated.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.200]   And you're technological,
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.320]   and they're much more procedural.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.840]   But they do the same things.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.360]   Which they plug in these great businesses,
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.700]   they empower them to run, et cetera.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.420]   Have you ever been tempted to more vertically integrate
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.120]   and you see categories and you think to yourself,
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.140]   wow, maybe we could do more.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.080]   We could enable this, or we could lower costs even further.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.960]   Or we could, if we owned this kind of a business,
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.200]   we could build logistics for everybody.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.960]   I mean, you kind of tried to do it a little bit.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.800]   Explain that journey.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.000]   - The decision is always like,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.080]   can we make it easier for other people to look amazing?
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.240]   That's like, it's not our job to be the front.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.840]   I mean, the quip of my investors,
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.520]   who are almost all Americans,
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:14.800]   was always like, only Canadians can build this company
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.800]   because you're trying to be nowhere.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.400]   You're doing the exact opposite.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.880]   Make other people look good.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.920]   And so, that's pretty deeply ingrained.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.440]   - That's called the anti-Jay Calvertism.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.720]   So, yeah.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.760]   So, now, I mean, I don't want to do Shopify basics
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.600]   or something like this.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.920]   That would be totally a side quest for us,
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.960]   and I'm big on main quest.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.840]   So, I want to keep things.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.240]   - You bought Deliver, but a week ago,
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.380]   when Flexport fired their CEO,
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.840]   you sold Deliver to Flexport,
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.400]   and then the same day, which is fucking boss,
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.000]   you signed a deal with Amazon.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.280]   - That's not what I intended.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.160]   - Although, that's how it was portrayed,
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.240]   was like a very, can you describe what happened?
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.720]   - There was a conspiracy theory tweet
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.160]   that went viral on this,
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.360]   that it was all a plan of Bezos
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.080]   that he put the guy in to run Flexport
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.920]   to get this deal done, and then jettison out,
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.600]   and then totally cripple Flexport.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.360]   - I gave him my highest recommendation.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.440]   - He's a wonderful man.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.840]   You should have him be your CEO.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.320]   - Amazing.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.160]   Yeah, I mean, I think people,
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.640]   conspiracy theory talk is really, really fun,
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.520]   but I think people massively underestimate
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.920]   how hard they are to execute.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.360]   This sounds very, very educate-y.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.280]   No, like the,
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.920]   again, here's what my friends
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.880]   who build a lot of companies on Shopify say.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.160]   They say it's most fun,
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.960]   like they treat it as a video game.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.320]   Many do it over and over and over again,
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.360]   and I want them to keep building these businesses,
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.240]   but they flip them, or they stop at a certain point.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.080]   Why?
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.920]   It's always the same.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.480]   At some point, they are getting to the point
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.640]   where like, okay, the next two years of my life,
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.000]   I'm going to build warehouses
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.600]   and deal with operational excellence,
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.880]   and I make online stores.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.400]   I make products.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.480]   This is what I wanna do.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.720]   So I'm like, okay, cool.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.000]   Like Shopify's big, I'm gonna pull the complexity
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.080]   of figuring out logistics into Shopify,
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.280]   because then I can amortize it
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.400]   over the total millions of stores that exist.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.560]   That was the plan.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.840]   We bootstrapped it, but we can't run it in the end,
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.680]   so this is like a vent to Flexport,
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.560]   because that's their main quest,
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.000]   and I think that's all totally okay.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.280]   I'm super profound as running their companies.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.400]   I think that's, so this is why I'm celebrating
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.320]   that Ryan is coming back,
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.320]   and also Ryan is totally fucking awesome.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.960]   - Why did you do the deal with Amazon?
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.960]   - Deal with Amazon is mostly about buy the prime.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.800]   Well, look, so this is, you know,
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.640]   a lot was made out of the Shopify challenging Amazon story,
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.040]   and you know, like it's a good story,
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.480]   but like, maybe this is a bit about me.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.400]   I'm a product, I'm not a product of business school, right?
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.680]   Like I'm an engineer, I apprentice,
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.280]   I'm a blue collar engineer.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.640]   I apprenticed as a programmer in Germany.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.640]   I had a Meister.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.360]   I could have gone for journeymanship,
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.800]   town to town, kind of doing this European thing,
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.880]   but I decided against it.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.480]   I grew up with open source.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.360]   It's positive some.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.720]   Like it's not fighting for percentage points.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.600]   We're like, we can build so much more if we work together.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.320]   And specifically around buy the prime,
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.200]   buy the, like prime is a credible brand.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.080]   It's probably a better brand than Amazon in some cases.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.120]   There is a plausible future in which,
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.000]   like the purchasers or buyers, as we call in our parlance,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.800]   like just want to buy everything through prime
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.720]   for because that's the trusted brand.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.120]   I think it would be very bad for my company.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.640]   And I think a lot of my customers,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.960]   if they would have to fire Shopify,
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.920]   just because their customers ask them
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.160]   to provide Amazon buy the prime services.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.840]   And I just like, so it's much better to work with them.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.600]   - In that way, you look at Amazon prime
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.400]   as like Visa or something.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.080]   It's just a technology.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.680]   It's a club of, it's a group of users.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.520]   Why keep them?
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.400]   - Shopify supports 86 different payment gateways.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.560]   I wrote 42 of integrations myself.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.560]   - So I'm curious how you do look at Amazon as a competitor
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.200]   and your advice to this entrepreneurial class
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.600]   of how they, knowing what you know,
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.280]   should engage with Amazon.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.720]   There has been a lot of hand-wringing
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.760]   and we see it with the FTC and Lena Kahn's obsession
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.720]   with I think Amazon and third-party fulfillment
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.160]   and Amazon house brands.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.920]   You referenced Amazon basics.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.760]   You just said basics,
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.240]   but obviously that's what you're referring to.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.960]   What is your analysis of,
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.120]   is it in the best interest of a shop
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.880]   to put their inventory on Amazon,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.400]   knowing that Amazon is kind of like the Borg.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.320]   They will study your product.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.680]   They will grind you down.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.720]   They will lower the price.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.000]   And then the corollary to that in part two,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.960]   what are you seeing in consumer thinking?
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.080]   Because as we watched every single product
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.000]   get copied so quickly,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.200]   fast between, whether it's fast fashion or fast gadgets,
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.760]   everything gets copied.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.800]   But what I find myself and a lot of other people doing now
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.400]   is retreating to brands and you mentioned trust.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   And so is there now the pendulum swinging to,
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.200]   I'm not trying to find the lowest price
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.720]   and the cheapest product.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.840]   I actually want a brand that I can trust.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.920]   And I think some people are wearing
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.760]   a certain brand of shoes here that they really like.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.600]   So maybe you could talk about those two things.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   - Say its name, Jason.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.320]   - Laura Piana.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.360]   And I have a pair now and they are buttery.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.680]   I literally put them on and I was like,
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.960]   I don't know if I deserve these.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.560]   I had to get myself back up for wearing $1,200 slippers.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.880]   But apparently these guys don't care.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.400]   - You can mix it up with a pair of Adams.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.600]   - Yeah, I know, I know.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.680]   You're the richest guy on the stage
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.120]   and you're wearing $16 shoes
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.400]   and these guys are wearing $1,200 shoes.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.400]   I think that's why you're the richest guy on the stage.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.840]   But anyway, let's talk about Amazon.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.960]   - So Amazon first.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.080]   Amazon is like, everyone should study the company.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.880]   They are absolutely incredible.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.000]   I again do not think about,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.360]   I do not like thinking about who gets which percentage.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.400]   I think it really messes with people's actual analysis
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.560]   of what they ought to be doing,
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.000]   especially entrepreneurs building in space.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.240]   Amazon is a rival and rivals are there
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.640]   to inspire you to be better.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.640]   If you treat any one of your competitors in a different way,
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.400]   I think you're causing a category mistake.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.480]   Maybe in the more physical world, absolutely best.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.560]   Like, it's really a clear finite pie.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.080]   Maybe you need to bring a different mindset,
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.800]   but like if you're anywhere close to software,
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.280]   it's positive, so I mean everything's growing.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.280]   So I think that's, I would say about Amazon.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.600]   - But now the brand part though.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.960]   You said that you have how many payment providers?
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.520]   - It's 86.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.920]   - 86, okay, so break down Stripe and Adyen for a second.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.240]   - Why was it between the three?
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.840]   - Stripe, Adyen, Braintree.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.680]   - Yes.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.960]   - Why do 86 payment providers even exist?
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.920]   - Yeah, that's an excellent question.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.560]   And has to do with--
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.960]   - Go back to your friction point.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.840]   - Yeah, yeah, the Byzantine world of interchange.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.440]   - Regulatory.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.280]   - And regulatory entrenchment.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.480]   - So that's all just regulatory capture?
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.200]   - I mean, look, some of these payment gateways,
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.600]   I mean, I really hope my team disabled them.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.520]   When I implemented them in 2004,
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.640]   here's what you had to do,
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.040]   is you had to take the credit card,
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.720]   put it into an Excel spreadsheet,
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.440]   and upload it to an FTP site.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.480]   - Yeah, unbelievable.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.080]   - So that's exactly as secure at AeroPron as you can imagine.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.800]   So, but that was the state of the art
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.000]   at a certain point of time, such as it is.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.680]   I have very low, maybe this is where my extraordinarily
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.680]   low opinion about the orthodoxy
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.080]   and the status quo comes from.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.720]   But it's, you know, Stripe and Alien,
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:19.480]   and maybe to a, sometimes, Braintree,
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.080]   are like much more competent implementations
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.640]   of this fundamental idea, and they're massively complex.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.640]   Like, again, they're interchangeable,
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.720]   because at the end of the day,
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.160]   you can do a lot of what you need to do
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.480]   with free API codes, it's basically authorized capture
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.400]   and purchase directly.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.240]   And so they look interchangeable,
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.440]   but like what's happening behind,
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.120]   I mean, they're great businesses.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.200]   - They're great businesses. - And specifically, yes.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.560]   - Okay, so there's Buy with Prime,
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.560]   you guys have Shopay, you know,
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.080]   all these things eventually are the things
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.440]   that these guys interact with, right?
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.000]   They're not gonna know what's behind the scenes,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.040]   they know that it's, Shopay is one click,
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.920]   it's elegant, it's amazing, I used it this weekend.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.040]   Buy with Prime, same kind of concept.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.800]   So what is it that you guys, you as a business,
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.440]   your shareholders will say,
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.400]   Toby, get as much margin as possible.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.960]   And obviously, you're gonna look at that and say,
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.760]   well, hold on, if I'm running a trillion dollars
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.880]   over my network, 50 basis points all of a sudden
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.800]   adds up to a lot of net income for me.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.040]   So you're gonna go and do it, that's like a no brainer.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.920]   What happens to those companies?
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.840]   What do they do where you would actually go back
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.960]   to your shareholders and say,
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.520]   ah, no, I'm gonna pay more to these guys tomorrow
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.560]   than I do today, because it's critical and I can't do it.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.640]   - Yeah, there's a lot more than meets the eye.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.000]   Like, honestly, we see companies go from one payment gate
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.840]   to another and everything about the business changes
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.080]   and they kind of don't know why.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.600]   The card acceptance rate are really, really different
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.800]   between them, there's a huge amount of machine learning
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.240]   goes into like what, at which point you want to accept
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.760]   which card, performance is a huge one.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.640]   Like, this is sort of a really invisible one,
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.040]   because like, latency to compute,
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.640]   or in the world of computing,
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.440]   it's sort of like pollution in the real world,
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.680]   it's like a negative externality sort of bestowed
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.480]   upon the next layer and other people.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.440]   But like, in e-commerce, you can just really see it, right?
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.920]   Like, it's, your sales are going down.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.720]   And it's usually credit card gateways
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.960]   that have the largest issue with performance
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.880]   and these kind of things that have to use basis points games
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.560]   to attract customers.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.280]   So we've actually seen sales going down in this way,
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.560]   both Stripe and Alien are excellent.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.880]   That's also, I mean, if you're asking about
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.960]   what makes these businesses and do they have,
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.880]   are they fungible?
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.600]   I mean, they're building trust relationships
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.480]   to the brand question, really, with the CFO office, right?
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.760]   Like, it's, in business software,
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.960]   just like consumer software, you know, attention matters
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.040]   or engagement, as it's called usually.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.000]   And you wanna, like, if you have a trust relationship
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.800]   with a CFO of a company, you are going to be hired
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.640]   for more and more services.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.640]   And there's a lot of services related to the flow of funds.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.440]   I think there's lots and lots of opportunities,
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.080]   just bringing it back, because you're trying to make me
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.520]   commit about making a value statement
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.040]   that's kind of a zero sum statement
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.280]   about two or three companies here.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.520]   You have a lot of opportunity in this space.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.840]   It's like there's a lot of fantastic new rails
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.800]   that are being built in the crypto world.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.080]   We're not so cool on this right now,
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.400]   but soon we are gonna be cool again,
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.840]   because this is the way humanity works.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.160]   And then we get to build,
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.960]   and there's some really, really good technology
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.080]   underneath it all, which is quite ready.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.440]   There's also, I mean, I don't know when the last time was,
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.200]   but a credit card network was created,
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.800]   but certainly a long time ago.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.080]   And there's a good deal of business brainsmanship
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.560]   that's going on from that side.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.840]   And I think there's some opportunities to work together.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.120]   - Tell us about what you're doing in AI.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.040]   You launched a co-pilot.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.920]   It's literally like anybody could become
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.360]   their own business person.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.200]   It's really incredible.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.400]   Do you wanna talk about that for a little bit?
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.240]   - Every time, this is my favorite thing about Shopify,
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.840]   other than the fact that we as a business
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.200]   sit on the same side of the table
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.400]   as the merchants, the partners.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.200]   The best thing we can do for Shopify
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.640]   for our business model
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.560]   is actually make our customers more successful,
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.560]   which is just, it's an incredible simplifier,
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.960]   and it's incredible how many businesses
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.560]   are actually really doing sort of a fakery cosplay
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.200]   on top of a principal agent problem, really.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.720]   So we have, it's much more simple for us.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:46.320]   The other thing, the thing that I'm so excited about,
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.320]   because I only had that as a hope when I started,
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.160]   but then it's proven out,
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.120]   is that this thing I said about the friction in the process,
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.480]   every single time we shipped something
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.280]   that reduced the friction by a meaningful amount,
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.040]   we actually had more successful business being built.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.200]   So we really, really proved that out in the numbers.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.840]   Great example is the payment gateway.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.960]   Again, initially you had to make a choice.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.080]   When I had to get my payment gateway
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.760]   for my snowboard store,
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.160]   I had to have a two-hour interview
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.280]   with someone in American Fork, Utah,
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.400]   and then mail my passport to them,
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.880]   but not a copy.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.360]   And so that's kind of the friction that existed
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.480]   for just formation.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.000]   And now it's instant underwriting,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.720]   and everyone just, the first time someone buys something,
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.440]   we tell you, "Hey, where is the money supposed to go?"
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:45.440]   So the amazing thing about AI is there's some problems
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.240]   we can't address with friction removal,
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:52.240]   which is actually sort of experience in life kind of thing.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.880]   My grandmother had a printing press place,
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.960]   copy shop with big letter presses and these kind of things.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.440]   I was, as a kid, doing the lead kerning,
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.000]   like typesetting the actual old stuff with her,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.800]   and it was hugely impressive.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.160]   She started this business.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:15.120]   So I had, in my film there,
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.840]   the concept of starting your business
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.320]   is a plausible solution to problems
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.960]   you might encounter in your life.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.440]   And that's probably true for most of the people
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.360]   you talk about in the entrepreneurial realm,
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.920]   but they have this experience.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.640]   And that's just, I mean, this is what's so good
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.440]   that your podcast and just society talks more
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.760]   about this being a possibility,
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.480]   but still people can't see themselves in it.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.440]   If they do, often they do it in a sort of reach
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.920]   via desperation.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.200]   Plan B for so many people on planet Earth
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.280]   is better than plan A.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.960]   It's the one, it's because they have learned to downgrade.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.640]   They've made the switch at some point.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.120]   - That's fantastic.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:01.960]   - Many, many people reach--
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.920]   - Lowering risk, I think, maybe is--
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.760]   - Exactly.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.680]   - People's default setting,
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.680]   and it worked for surviving on the planet,
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.360]   but maybe it doesn't work for the modern era.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.400]   And taking risk is more bold.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.200]   So what does the Co-Pilot do?
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.160]   - It's, well, hopefully it helps you with courage.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.200]   It maintains your courage,
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.240]   because you courageously reach for,
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.880]   I'm gonna try this thing in my lunch break,
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.080]   but here's someone you can,
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.560]   like we survey people,
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.640]   like successful stores tend to,
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.320]   like I think with 85% answer that,
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.680]   you had someone who would return a text in 24 hours
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.320]   with a question about starting a business.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.680]   It's massive predictor of success.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.120]   So I think what chatbots are already good at
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.040]   is being patient and competent
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.560]   and answering your questions.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.240]   There's a lot of questions they can't answer
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.280]   because there's, just not the training set
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.840]   isn't ideal for niche pursuits
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.640]   such as e-commerce entrepreneurship,
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.160]   but that's something we can fix
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.800]   through wonders of fine tuning and these kind of things.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.920]   And so what does it do?
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.920]   We want it to be like just someone
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.240]   who sits next to you, basically.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.800]   It's like a chat, you can ask questions about business,
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.320]   but if you say, hey, I need my store
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.600]   to look more like summer rather than fall or whatever,
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.000]   now it will be able to help you with that
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.360]   and will ask you questions.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.280]   - If you ask it to like, what should I do
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.040]   in terms of product discovery
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.200]   or how can I increase sales,
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.360]   I saw on the demo, it would say,
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.040]   hey, you should put these things on the front page
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.640]   and you may wanna do this type of sale.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.480]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.040]   It's pretty amazing. - It's pretty amazing.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.480]   It's honestly, I mean, sometimes it's unbelievably dumb.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.720]   - That's trained on all Shopify data,
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.120]   not just that user, right?
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.960]   So there's a clear aggregation effect,
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.800]   a flywheel effect.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.440]   - You did a, I'm always interested
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.480]   in the really outlier founders
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.040]   because they do business differently.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.680]   They learn different tasks,
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.800]   and different ways of managing people.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.040]   And we didn't get into it with Ray,
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.800]   but man, Bridgewater has a whole operating system
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.560]   of how they record people. - Very impressive.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.840]   - It's very impressive, it's very intense.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.280]   You have a very interesting one
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.720]   where you released and it went viral
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.880]   a counter, so when you make a meeting,
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.280]   it tells you how much that meeting cost.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.840]   And then you demanded everybody justify
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.960]   the cost of the meetings.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.440]   I don't know if you're making them account
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.120]   for it on their budgets or not yet,
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.080]   but this resonated and hit a chord.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.600]   Looking at the success of the company,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.160]   what are the two or three operating principles,
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.080]   like the, I would say, a no meeting culture
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.080]   or a meeting if it's really essential culture,
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.080]   but what are the other two or three things
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.600]   that now when you look forward running this company
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.560]   and getting it to the next level,
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.440]   which is gonna be harder and harder,
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.160]   this is how we operate at Tobii's Shopify.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.200]   - Yeah, look, I take the founder role very seriously.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.000]   Again, this is not about me,
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.240]   but it's like I think companies that have,
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.120]   there is a founder slot which might be filled or not
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.280]   in every company because every company got founded.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.360]   If the founder slot is filled,
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.720]   you have incredible ability to change the company,
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.440]   partly because the way,
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.120]   I always loved social capital as a concept,
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.960]   and I think a lot about it.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.680]   To me, this is like a bank account.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.840]   It's a balance that's deposited,
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:30.000]   and the way any kind of value is deposited into it
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.400]   comes from storytelling.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.160]   And the founding story is ever-present in a company,
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.800]   therefore there is daily settlements
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.680]   into the account accruing to a founder,
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.680]   and if a founder is not there anymore,
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.480]   it's sort of like someone deleted the private key
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.080]   and you can't spend it anymore.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.000]   So what am I spending it on?
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.440]   I want Shopify to be a company that is,
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.320]   well, first of all, it's really, really, really great
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.840]   for crafters.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:59.080]   Again, I apprenticed, it's blue collar
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.760]   in approach to engineering.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.240]   This should be a crafter's paradise,
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.000]   and we just really, really, really make sure
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.520]   we have great teams and great environments
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.520]   for crafters to do their craft,
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.840]   and that's usually very small teams and so on.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.760]   There's a huge amount of anti-status quo bias.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:20.320]   It is just like, man, the world is not that great.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.000]   All companies are terrible.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.400]   The only thing any of us gets to hope for
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.080]   is that at the end of our careers,
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.800]   we're gonna look at the companies we built in 2020
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.360]   and beyond or before and say,
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.960]   "My company was slightly less terrible
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.160]   "than all the other companies."
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.760]   That's the best anyone can do.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.440]   To me, that's actually a super hopeful message
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.120]   because that reduces the complexity of a task.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.160]   That's something I can do,
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.800]   just being slightly less terrible.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.800]   - Subclass.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.000]   - But the key thing is subtraction,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.760]   and this is where the founders' lots energy comes from.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.440]   It seems to me that it's only founders
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.160]   who subtract in companies.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.320]   This is the meeting thing in a nutshell.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.640]   Everyone adds recurring meetings and gums up the system.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.000]   I'm super pro-great meetings,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.800]   but once every couple, year and a half or so,
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.560]   we randomly delete all recurring meetings.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.800]   We actually gonna do random deletion of Slack channels
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.840]   and all these kind of things
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.560]   just because they will come back if they are useful.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.200]   (audience applauding)
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.120]   So I think that gives you a sense.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.920]   I don't think I have time for dissertation,
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.320]   but again, it's super fun building companies.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.880]   It's a really, really fun thing to do,
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.000]   and taking it seriously is best I'll find it.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.400]   - Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna say thank you.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.600]   - Toby, thank you.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.760]   (audience applauding)
