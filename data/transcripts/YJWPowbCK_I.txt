[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   The following is a conversation with Josh Barnett,
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.720]   one of the greatest fighters
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.820]   and submission wrestlers in history,
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.680]   with an epic 25-year career
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.200]   that includes being the UFC heavyweight champion
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.400]   and countless other accolades.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.400]   He also happens to be one of the most intelligent
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.920]   and brutally honest human beings in all of martial arts,
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.040]   and especially so about his appreciation of
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.080]   and fascination with violence.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.080]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.080]   which feels ridiculous to say after that introduction.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.240]   Munk Pack Low Carb Snacks,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.260]   Element Electrolyte Drinks,
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.280]   Eight Sleep Self-Cooling Mattress,
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.940]   and Rev Transcription and Captioning Service.

[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.800]   at the support of this podcast.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.960]   As a side note, let me say that I've been a fan
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.100]   of Josh Barnett for a long time.
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.000]   This conversation was indeed a long time coming,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.400]   and I'm sure we'll talk many times again.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.160]   For what it's worth, I'm a student of combat sports
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.960]   and admire when they're done at the highest level,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.720]   either through masterful execution of skill
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.720]   or relentless dominance of pure guts.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.320]   For context, I'm a black belt in jiu-jitsu
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.900]   and have competed in wrestling, submission grappling,
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.720]   jiu-jitsu, judo, and even catch wrestling,
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.560]   which is a variant of submission grappling
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.480]   that Josh is one of the great practitioners,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.480]   scholars, and teachers of.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.760]   I could probably talk for hours
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.200]   about what I've learned from my time on the mat,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.960]   but if I were to say one thing,
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.560]   it is that the mat is honest.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.360]   You can't run away from yourself when you step on the mat.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.720]   It reveals your fears, the lies you might tell yourself,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.140]   all the delusions you might have, or at least I had,
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.740]   that there's anything in this world that can be achieved
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.600]   except through blood, sweat, and tears.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.240]   That honesty, taken to the highest levels,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.840]   as is the case with Josh,
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.120]   creates the most special of human beings
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.220]   and definitely someone who is fascinating to talk to.

[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.400]   Who were the philosophers and philosophical ideas
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.640]   that influenced you the most?
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.920]   - Are we just jumping right in?
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.200]   - We're right in, into the deepest.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   - No foreplay on camera, all right.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.880]   I had an interesting philosophical journey,
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.200]   at least I think it's interesting,
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   and that was, I think, as far as organized philosophy,
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.800]   or maybe, authentic's not the right word,
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.920]   but like, yeah, we'll say organized.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.520]   I would say that Nietzsche is probably one of the people
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.400]   with the most influence on me,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   but I also feel like, to a degree,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.560]   your personality will oftentimes dictate
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.520]   what philosophers that you can vibe with.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.680]   - So what ideas from Nietzsche was it, the Übermensch?
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.720]   - Definitely the Übermensch is huge to me,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.960]   because I see it as an extension of,
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.740]   basically, the religious concepts of God and higher ideals,
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.720]   but just put into a different, secular context.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.640]   And the idea, also, that the Übermensch is striving
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.480]   and overcoming something that you're always working towards
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.160]   that very few will ever,
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.160]   it's not like the concept that you can just make them.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.840]   It doesn't happen that way,
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   and it's not based simply upon if you were, say,
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.240]   put through a genetic program
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.920]   and turned into a super soldier.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.480]   That wouldn't make it.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.240]   That's the very surface level and incorrect understanding
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.400]   of what the Übermensch is.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.640]   The Übermensch is the idea of this kind of human
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.640]   that transcends all the weaker, lower aspects of humans,
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.280]   which we're full of.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.960]   But I also think that there's an element
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.780]   in Nietzsche's writing that suggests
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.200]   that it's not something you can even be in all the time.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.360]   Like, it's even a temporary state,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.960]   because it's not something that we're capable of maintaining.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.440]   - It's something to strive for.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.280]   Like a morality, an image, an ideal,
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.880]   a set of principles that we can connect to
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.520]   that doesn't rely on otherworldly,
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.280]   kind of out there things.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.560]   It's deeply human.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.600]   - With Nietzsche, I feel like the concept of the Übermensch
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.920]   is something built on authenticity as well.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.280]   Heidegger was like Dasein, right?
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.560]   So when you are authentic,
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.680]   and Heidegger being a follower of Nietzsche's
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.280]   and highly influenced by him.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.440]   I think that the Übermensch is an example of authenticity
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.280]   in that it isn't about trying to be anything
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.160]   that you cannot be, or to go against who you are,
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.920]   but to actually understand that, accept that,
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.760]   and then work with what you can work with
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.760]   and create from your lump of clay that is you.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.880]   Because I can't become...
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.000]   There's certain things that are just not gonna happen
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.520]   for me because it's not in my proclivity.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.040]   I mean, I'm never gonna be five foot tall and 120 pounds.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.400]   I mean, that again, I guess.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   But I know, as you get more in tune with who you are,
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.240]   as you start learning more about what unique things,
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.920]   or at least what that combination that makes you,
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.040]   that gestalt part of yourself,
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.320]   what those things are and how you can use them,
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.640]   then you can work towards being that,
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.880]   taking what that is and seeing if you can get to that point.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.360]   Now, the likelihood is, no, maybe, probably never.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.920]   I mean, but we can never achieve godhood,
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.440]   yet religion is a constant striving
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.840]   and a look at a higher ideal concept,
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.960]   even if it's multiple gods or one god.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.480]   It's still essentially all built around this concept.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.320]   Like, I like the idea of Catholics' original sin,
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.920]   if you think of sin not as evil, but as missing the mark,
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.360]   the archer's term where it derives,
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.360]   or even like in Spanish, without.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.040]   So, as being, if you accept that you are imperfect,
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.400]   if you accept that you need to constantly strive,
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.800]   even against yourself, because you will figure out
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.320]   the best ways at which to submarine your own capabilities,
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.400]   submarine your own dreams and wishes and whatever,
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.240]   you will ruin them more than anything else.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.160]   And you will tell yourself that you ruined them on purpose,
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.520]   for a good reason, or you'll say that you'll figure out
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.560]   a way to put it on everything else but yourself.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.680]   And so, the idea of thinking of,
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.400]   well, as I'm starting off on this whole thing,
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.560]   I got a lot of work to do, and that's just the way it is.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.920]   And I gotta figure out what areas those are gonna be.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.360]   And so, I thought, oh yeah, if I think of original sin,
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.380]   actually can be, that can be kind of a clever idea,
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.380]   but it's also just accepting that we're all uniquely strange
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.120]   and unequal in our own ways,
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.960]   but we have to figure out how that fits in.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.860]   - The word authenticity kinda connects to all of that.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.780]   So, striving to be your authentic self means
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.620]   figuring out exactly the shape of the flaws,
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.860]   the character of your little demons that you get to play with
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.740]   and around them finding a path to whatever the hell
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.500]   ideal versions of yourself you can carve,
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.460]   and pretending like that's such a thing is even possible.
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.980]   The other idea about Nietzsche is,
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.740]   on his idea of morality, he presents the argument
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.900]   that morality's a human illusion,
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.420]   and that there's not such a thing as good and evil,
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.460]   and these are all kinda constructs.
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.580]   Do you think there's such a thing as good and evil
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.900]   that's connected to some objective reality?
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.680]   - I think that there are some,
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.940]   I actually do believe that there are some universals.
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.540]   I'm not Kantian in any way,
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.420]   but I do think that there are some universals.
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.740]   And the thing that actually brought me
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.060]   to even the concept of that was Jung.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:02.060]   So, Jung's concept of the collective unconsciousness,
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.900]   and then taking that thought and then applying it
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.420]   to looking through history,
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.740]   and the most varied history you can find.
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.140]   So, I would say probably religion is your earliest one
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.420]   that you can get for written history,
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:22.420]   or written examples of human behavior and psychology
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.280]   at the furthest that we can look into it,
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.180]   from man's hand to whatever the medium is,
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.660]   cuneiform or whatever.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.660]   But as you do that, and then let's say going
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.660]   from Mesopotamia to India to Europe,
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.800]   and just going from all these places,
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.540]   as disparate as they may seem,
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.820]   as many different cultures and ethnicities and religions,
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.740]   and how the religions will vary quite a bit
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.740]   from monotheist to polytheist, and so on and so forth.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.820]   But then just seeing how there's all the through lines.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.600]   And of course, Campbell, he did this much earlier
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.780]   than me thinking about it.
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:06.780]   But I think that by looking at things that way
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.700]   and starting to find the threads,
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.500]   instead of always just looking at everything
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.980]   as being its own compartmentalized concept,
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.540]   is if it only applies to this time,
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.580]   this people, getting overly pomo about it
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.560]   is just a really idiotic postmodern.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.500]   - So, you think that there is, just like Joseph Campbell,
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.020]   there's a thread that connects all of these stories,
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.000]   narratives that we constructed for ourselves as we evolve,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.260]   and that thread is grounded in some kind of absolute ideas
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.660]   of maybe on the morality side,
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.380]   which is the trickiest one, of good and evil.
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.340]   - Somewhat, yeah.
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.580]   I think that a lot of this stuff is just derived
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.300]   from a biological perspective.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.340]   I feel like these things are innate within us.
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.180]   - Do you think our innately humans are good?
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.020]   Like we-- - No.
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:52.860]   I don't.
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.460]   I feel like, I also feel like there's an issue of scale too.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.300]   Like Nassim Taleb likes to talk about how he views his,
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.260]   the way he interacts with groups in terms of scale.
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.300]   What is this thing about at the familial level,
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.060]   I'm a communist, and then at the civic level,
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.660]   I'm a Republican or something, and at this other level,
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.580]   and then it goes on, at the widest level,
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.180]   he's a libertarian or something of that nature.
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.620]   - Like fundamentally, human interaction changes--
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.780]   - On scale. - On scale.
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:28.580]   - On scale, and also from subjective
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.140]   to the environment around them.
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.700]   And I don't even mean environment just in the sake
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.100]   of physical environment, nature, right?
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.700]   Like nature's constantly trying to murder you.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.780]   Well, it's not really trying, it's just nature's being nature
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.180]   and the universe is the universe,
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.780]   and at times it takes you out.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.780]   It's just not with any particular compunction or prejudice.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.780]   It's just, oops, sorry, there's no more dodo's.
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.860]   - My bad.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.580]   - But don't you think the particular flavor
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.180]   of the complexity that is the human mind was created,
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.220]   like, let me make an argument
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.900]   for that all people are fundamentally good.
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.740]   - Okay.
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:10.940]   - There's an evolutionary advantage to striving
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.660]   to cooperate, to add more love to the world,
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.140]   of compassion, empathy, all that kind of stuff,
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.860]   and that the very thing that created the human mind
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.740]   was this evolutionary advantage,
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.180]   whatever the forces behind this evolutionary advantage.
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.660]   - And scale, yes.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.420]   So when we're dealing with a small tribe, sure.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.540]   When you meet another tribe, maybe.
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.980]   There's other factors that are going into that.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.980]   Let's say you scale up and so your 150
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.660]   has exceeded their 150, and you start to get
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:52.660]   to a certain point where you can't really be close enough
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.940]   to someone down the line of that next,
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.020]   like that 150's 150, 150, and they just now
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.220]   all of a sudden become some guy, whatever.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.260]   And when it comes to some guy, once it starts hitting scale,
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.860]   I don't know that it's capable.
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:16.780]   People can be as magnanimous to a stranger
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.500]   as to the known.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:23.220]   If they orient themselves to be secure enough,
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.460]   'cause it does come to security, insecurity,
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.460]   in one way or the other, either brought on by the unknown,
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.300]   brought on by an actual threat, brought on by even their own
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.140]   as we would use the word insecurity
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.780]   in that their own insecurity within their own capabilities,
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.260]   their own belief in themselves, all these things
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.180]   can change things from being compassionate
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.620]   and what have you to at least at the very,
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.620]   maybe not evil, but self-interest driven
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:54.620]   to the point of negative results for those that aren't.
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.900]   - Right, but another way to frame that is maybe
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.900]   it's less about scale and more about the amount
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.100]   of resources available, so if we're overflowing
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:10.100]   with resources in terms of security and safety,
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.620]   all the things you've mentioned,
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.260]   if we have more than enough resources,
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.900]   then the way we treat a stranger,
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.580]   the way we position ourselves towards that stranger
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.580]   might be in a way that allows us to be our real human selves
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.020]   as opposed to sort of our animal self.
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.620]   And therefore, it's mostly about how clever
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.380]   can we descendants of apes be in coming up
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.260]   with all cool kinds of technologies and ways
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.500]   to efficiently use the resources we have
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.180]   such that we're not constrained.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:46.180]   And my hope is that human innovation
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.740]   will outpace the growth of our,
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.140]   the number of people that are starving for resources.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.060]   - Yes, I think that there's a lot of rationality
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.260]   behind this argument.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:04.260]   And in some ways, I agree, and in a lot of ways,
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:09.780]   I see it as missing the point of how the system
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.380]   is a resource, but it's missing the point
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.540]   of how this experiment has been playing out across time.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:20.540]   When you look at what, for one, it's like define resources.
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:25.700]   What is a resource as humans would define it,
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.620]   or wealth even?
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.900]   And so you can say, well, an iPhone's a resource,
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.620]   the internet's a resource, water obviously is a resource,
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.100]   what is more important to human beings?
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.580]   Water, internet, or iPhones?
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.700]   It's water, right?
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.300]   So if we look at resources, if we start with
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.780]   what do human beings need to live?
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.420]   I mean, actually live, not live here
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.340]   in this bullshit fantasy creation extension
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.900]   of our own ingenuity and a prison of our own creation
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.260]   and also a paradise of our own creation.
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.020]   But this is not how human beings normally live.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.820]   This is all built upon stuff,
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.980]   this is built on concept, on idea,
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.060]   and some of it's built on just, well, this is the paradigm,
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.900]   so this is what you do.
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.780]   Human beings need food, they need water to survive,
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.620]   they need shelter from the elements,
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.500]   and they need certain skills to perpetuate these things
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.700]   and be able to pass them down so that they can,
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.840]   so that these things don't become,
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.460]   you don't end up in this gap where you have
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.820]   to relearn things, 'cause if it's lost,
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.660]   then that time before you can get it back again
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.820]   is going to be dark ages of sorts,
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.260]   or it's going to be highly detrimental to your group,
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.540]   because not knowing how to fish, not knowing how to hunt,
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.180]   not knowing how to even clean and cook the game
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.420]   once you have it could be lethal.
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.740]   - That's fascinating to think of that as a basic resource,
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.540]   the knowledge to attain the very low level things
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.380]   of water and food.
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.540]   - You'll figure it out.
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.380]   We did it once before, and we've done it over and over
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.580]   and over and over again.
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.060]   - It's just costly.
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.260]   - Yes, it has costs, for sure.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:19.540]   But when you think of how you look at the,
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.400]   well, we'll just deal with the first world of the West.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   You look at the pathway of Western civilization
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.700]   and its growth, and then you look at how technology
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.980]   has been injected into it over time,
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.180]   how it magnifies things or pushes things
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.900]   at orders of magnitude faster,
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.420]   and then the internet comes along, and even faster.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.980]   So you're watching industrial revolution
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.580]   to what is it, the capacitor, and then so on.
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.820]   It goes further and further.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.580]   And as the internet and technology,
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.020]   especially on the electronic side of things,
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.380]   start increasing in capability,
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:04.380]   massively outpaces even our necessity for it at times.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.380]   It becomes plant obsolescence happens quicker
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.140]   and over and over and over again.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.120]   And wealth increases, increases, increases, increases
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.940]   in terms of the things that we're able to acquire.
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.740]   I've seen homeless people with smartphones.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.680]   So we're living in the most wealth-laden,
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.680]   luxury-laden age of all of humanity yet.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.600]   What happens when we see calamity
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.000]   or people go on hard time?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.720]   What are the things that they value?
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.720]   What do people go to an argument about the cost
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.760]   of things that are luxury items generally
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.680]   and not necessity items?
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   We get into fights about things that are,
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.320]   at the end of the day, not necessities to us.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.560]   People are so concerned about Netflix and the internet.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.720]   Personally, I'm very concerned about the internet
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.640]   because I look at it as my own little personal library
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.080]   of Alexandria in my pocket.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.040]   That's what I love about it.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.040]   And the ability to have a tool as effective as it is,
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.760]   even though I'm in a constant battle,
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.880]   to not let that tool become a vice
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.560]   or to become something that actually brings me
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.040]   to a lower state.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.680]   - But the question is, are we willing to murder each other
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.240]   over Netflix versus murder each other over water?
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.760]   - We're willing to murder each other over water.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.800]   That's a given.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.160]   - Right, but that's our animalistic selves.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.000]   - Well, it's also a necessity for,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.920]   it's animalistic, but it's also either you do it
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.560]   or you don't, right?
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.440]   Unless somebody's willing to share that water
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.000]   or if that water is of such a limited capability
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.360]   or such a limited amount, then you will have to murder
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.200]   to have that water.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.760]   - With Netflix, the argument is the higher we get up
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.600]   to this hierarchy of what we consider
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.240]   in Los Angeles resources, we're less willing
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.000]   to commit violence.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.160]   - We're less willing to commit violence,
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.720]   I would say, over Netflix, but we are willing
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.920]   to commit violence over Netflix,
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.500]   over everything associated with Netflix,
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.480]   over televisions, over sneakers, over,
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.920]   I mean, when we look at a good,
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.560]   I mean, the majority of the stuff that came
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.520]   with the riots, I mean, it was used car dealerships,
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.880]   targets, I mean, and then you look and it's like,
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.440]   well, okay, what are people, what do they gotta,
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.800]   what are they so hell-bent to get out of this whole thing?
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.680]   And I'm even talking about the ideological elements
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.000]   or anything like that, just like, okay,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.040]   something's going on, boom, looting, whatever.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.200]   - Yeah, other stuff.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.640]   - What are you gonna loot?
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.680]   You'll have AOC say, oh, people needing bread.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.760]   I didn't see a single loaf of bread.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.160]   I saw televisions and shoes. - It's poetry, Josh.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.720]   - But to me, it is poetry in a sense,
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.720]   because you get to see how we actually are operating,
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.560]   what is becoming first principles to most people.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.400]   - Wait, wait, but you could also argue, though,
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.680]   that those riots were more like the madness of crowds,
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.680]   which is like-- - Oh, it's definitely
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.060]   a lot more than just that.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.720]   I'm just saying that given a chance, it's like, okay,
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.840]   boom, the lights are off, the grid is down,
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.100]   we've hacked into the whole system.
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.860]   Turned into an '80s movie.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.860]   And you have the ability to go get ahold of whatever it is
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.540]   that you think is most important.
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.700]   And what do we do?
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.620]   And I say we, as in, you know, including all of us,
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.020]   we grab a TV, we attack it,
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.260]   we break into a sneaker store in Melrose.
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.820]   We do, it's just like, ah, we steal giant cause statues,
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.460]   where the value of that is completely market-driven.
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.760]   It's just a piece of polypropylene or whatever, butyl,
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.980]   and it's cool, I'm a big fan of art.
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.500]   But it's like, (laughs)
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.900]   you know, I can't eat that, and at the end of the day,
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.620]   man, you're sitting there with your,
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.340]   like, what'd you do today, honey, what'd you get?
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.300]   You know, man, we were able to, you know,
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.220]   oh, I got this designer art statue.
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.820]   Are you gonna go, well, you can't really sell it
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.820]   on the art markets, where people
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.020]   are really gonna pay for it, so are you gonna become
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.100]   an underground art dealer with your one piece of cause art?
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.480]   - One interesting thing, just before I forget it,
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.240]   you mentioned the Library of Alexandria, and your--
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.400]   - Phone.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.160]   - Well, your phone, but also just thinking
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.240]   of your little world that you're creating
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.320]   for yourself on the internet.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.600]   That's a really powerful way to actually phrase it.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.400]   One of the things that, you've been on Joe Rogan
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.240]   several times, I've always--
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.360]   - Although everybody always comes to me,
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.960]   and go, oh, that was so great, I didn't know,
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.440]   you've been on Joe Rogan?
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.280]   I go, this is like my fifth time, dude.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.120]   - I've been a fan of yours for a long time,
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.180]   from other avenues.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.740]   - This is a long time coming, actually.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.260]   Everybody, you have no idea how many times
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:54.020]   through messaging and missing each other over the years,
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.160]   this is ridiculous, this is a long time coming.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.700]   You don't realize how special this is for us.
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.020]   - Well, I'm also starstruck.
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.380]   We'll talk about this, but you symbolize something
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.700]   very important to me through my journey,
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.260]   through wrestling, through jiu-jitsu, through judo,
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.460]   through just street fighting, through just combat.
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.100]   There's, you're the, in some sense,
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.780]   the devil on my shoulder of violence.
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:22.300]   Devil gets a bad rap.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.300]   - He does get a bad rap.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.420]   I realize, sitting encased in ice down
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.940]   at that low-ass level.
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.740]   - But the angel side is more like the athletic,
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.540]   the sport, the science, the technical,
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.580]   the chess side of things.
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.820]   But on the Library of Alexandria, let me ask,
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.220]   because you were on Joe Rogan,
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.980]   it does make me really sad, and I realize
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.540]   that I'm just probably being romantic,
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:53.260]   that his, most of his library of interviews
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.660]   that were on YouTube have now been taken down
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.300]   because he went to Spotify.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.420]   And that was the first, I'm probably an idiot,
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.020]   but it was the first time I realized
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.220]   that this knowledge that we've been building up
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.340]   on the internet doesn't necessarily last forever.
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.420]   - No, it doesn't, unless you preserve it.
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.820]   I mean, it's like all things.
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:16.820]   If you do not preserve them, if you do not make efforts,
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.540]   so many of my, it just really brings to mind
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.700]   right off the top of my head, so many friends of mine
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.380]   that are Jewish, they're basically secular.
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.700]   But yet, through even the secular aspect
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.220]   of just keeping the traditions alive,
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.620]   it's like, well, you could always pick a book
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.380]   and read about it, clearly, it's called the Torah.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:44.340]   But if you don't put these things into action,
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.580]   if you don't make them a part of your consciousness,
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.580]   maybe even subconsciousness, just through repetition,
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.420]   they will die, they will become simply something
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.980]   that exists somewhere until you find it again.
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.940]   And Carl Gottsch used to say something,
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.920]   he would say that I don't invent moves,
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.780]   I just rediscover them.
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:10.460]   But yet, Gottsch and Billy Robinson also would understand
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:16.380]   that if someone's not carrying the torch, it'll go out.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.740]   Now, that doesn't mean fire can't be rekindled,
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.780]   it just means that that torch no longer
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.300]   is lighting the way on this knowledge.
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:29.300]   And so it's important to be an individual,
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.660]   even on an individual level, to be a repository
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.700]   for aspects of knowledge.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:40.140]   - You mentioned Gottsch, you consider yourself
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:45.940]   a catch wrestler, so I've mentioned to you offline
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.180]   that I competed in a couple of catch wrestling tournaments.
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.300]   Can we go Wikipedia level at the very basic,
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.340]   you're the exactly right person to ask,
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.020]   what is catch wrestling, and what are
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.580]   its defining principles?
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:02.660]   - I would say the easiest way for us to talk about
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:07.660]   and give an overview of what catch is,
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:12.180]   in the simplest terms, is think of collegiate wrestling
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.780]   with submissions, that is essentially what catch is.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.300]   And it's not surprising because collegiate wrestling
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.480]   is actually derived from catch as catch can.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:25.620]   It's just that over time, certain aspects were removed
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:30.540]   from the competition structure, so that they became
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.300]   null elements, things that were discarded.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.940]   But it's funny that you can take high level
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:42.540]   amateur collegiate types, and you can show them a move
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.540]   and then add a little bit to it and go,
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.180]   oh, well hey, that was just like what we already do here,
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.780]   but except, oh, I didn't know you could take it
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:53.080]   all the way to this point, or things of that nature,
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.820]   especially when it comes to professional wrestling,
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.260]   like teaching people, no, I know you're just using this
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.780]   for in a show, but this is actually a real move
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.140]   and here's how it really feels.
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.940]   - And so collegiate wrestling, and wrestling in general
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.580]   for people who are not aware, is basically two people
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.580]   start on their feet, and they have to score,
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.180]   they're trying to take each other down,
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.860]   and they have to, they score points along the way.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.100]   You can end matches by pinning them, for example,
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.460]   on their back.
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.960]   I think one way to describe wrestling is,
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.100]   it's very much about figuring out ways
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.860]   to establish control and leverage in these kind of tie-ups,
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:35.740]   or there's different styles where you can do more
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.060]   from a distance to where it's more about the timing
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.580]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:43.540]   Ultimately, it's an art of both upper body and lower body,
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.180]   and you could choose the different puzzles
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.400]   that you solve there.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.600]   You could be attacking the head, the arms,
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.440]   you could be attacking the legs.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.220]   There's also part of collegiate wrestling
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.380]   that's on the ground that has more,
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.100]   what's called a referee's position or whatever.
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.780]   - Right, the referee's position where you're on
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.500]   your hands and knees, basically.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.020]   And so--
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.420]   - Do you understand what that's supposed to simulate?
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.500]   Why is that one of the standard positions?
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.220]   - It's one of the standard positions because,
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.220]   one, it's one of the easiest ways to actually get up,
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.980]   but two, it's because you cannot be on your back.
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.940]   If you're on your back, you're getting pinned.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.100]   And back exposure, or being pinned,
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:26.900]   is pretty much the universal wrestling thing.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.900]   One, taking the guy from their feet to the floor,
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.820]   and two, pinning them.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.140]   As you go from, what is it,
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:40.460]   Cornish wrestling, Turkish oil wrestling,
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:44.180]   Mongolian, Sumo, Indian,
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.100]   well, they'll call it Pellwani, it's also called Kushti,
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:53.460]   Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, so many of them.
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:58.060]   Isombo, even if it doesn't end the match,
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.540]   it's still one of the most important aspects
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:05.260]   of the competition itself across every style.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.900]   - And this is where submission, like catch wrestling,
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.900]   or submission wrestling, or Jiu-Jitsu feels different.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:16.060]   It seems like for most wrestling, for a lot of wrestling,
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:21.060]   the dominance is the goal, as opposed to submission,
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.340]   which I guess those two are related,
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.340]   but dominating the position.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.420]   So that's what pinning is.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.860]   It's almost like breaking your opponent,
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:36.060]   breaking through all of their defenses
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.580]   to where they're completely defenseless
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.180]   and you can do anything with them that you want.
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.880]   Maybe that's what could be a definition of dominance,
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.580]   I don't know. (laughs)
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.820]   - It sounds very much like a chain to a radiator, yeah.
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.780]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.380]   Yeah, there's a thread that connects all partners.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.260]   But submission feels different.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.300]   - It is actually different when you think about it
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.980]   across the landscape.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.240]   I don't think radically different,
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.900]   but still slightly different in that,
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.900]   if you think of wrestling as being derived
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.620]   from combat, right?
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.940]   So, well, it is combat sports, but more lethal combat.
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.580]   Getting somebody off their feet and onto their back
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.860]   is about as lethal a place for the person on bottom to be.
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:22.460]   In general, I mean, don't come at me with your talks
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.420]   about your fucking worm guards and blah, blah, blah,
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.180]   and whatever spider, barren, okay, get out of here with that.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.780]   We're not talking about you
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.300]   in this highly regimented sporting environment.
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.780]   We're talking about general, all the body hair,
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.620]   none of the waxing human beings.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:44.620]   So, getting someone on their back, okay.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.060]   As you're trying to get up,
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.660]   you're getting hit with a rock or stabbed
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.620]   or what have you, set on fire, who knows.
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.400]   Generally, these conflicts are not just isolated
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.460]   to one-on-one.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.320]   If it's four-on-two, your buddy that was with you
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.220]   back-to-back, now he's on his back.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.060]   What do you think?
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.620]   Now it's gonna be one-on-one while three go on one.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.700]   So, and then you go, you elevate this
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.940]   to armored combat, right?
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.460]   And it's boom, put 'em on the ground.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.700]   Oh, crap, it's hard to get up.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.300]   Well, while you're struggling to get up, stab.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.860]   That's where jujitsu's concepts come from
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.900]   with all their leveraging and off-balancing is,
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.160]   oh man, if I end up in this situation
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.660]   in tight, close quarters combat,
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.140]   yes, we could fight it out with swords and knives
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.860]   and what have you, but it's way easier
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.900]   if the first thing I can do is foot sweep you on your back
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.380]   and then pull my knife and just go stick.
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.420]   - Is there a thread that connects
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.800]   all of these different arts from, not just arts,
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.400]   but from the very base violence of war,
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.780]   just like you said, that there's no rules,
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:52.340]   to the very regimented IBJF--
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.980]   - I do. - Jujitsu tournaments.
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.600]   And just, you've kinda laid out some of it,
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.500]   but can you go all the way to the--
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.120]   - So, when you start off with absolute skills
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.200]   in the sense of absolute offense and defense
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.260]   in the taking or preserving of life,
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:12.260]   full-on at its purest form of self-defense
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:18.100]   and self-preservation, and then you extrapolate
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:23.100]   part of that in that all animals train in violence.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:27.940]   All play usually degenerates into some sort of soft violence.
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.000]   So, be it cats when they're kittens and puppies,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.080]   and everything learns how to kill, how to fight.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:40.020]   Not that, just that dumb alpha meme stuff
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.180]   where the idea is that, oh, by being alpha,
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.540]   that means you run around basically
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.060]   just being a bully and a shithead.
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:50.060]   No, actually, alpha wolves spend very little time fighting
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.380]   because if you were actually alpha,
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.060]   you don't get into fights.
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.940]   There's no need to.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.780]   And if you're probably getting into
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.220]   any large amount of fights,
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.700]   it's probably 'cause you're being shitty at being an alpha,
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.240]   and now people are tired of you being in charge.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.660]   And yet, in the animal world,
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.700]   and it would be the same for human beings
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.500]   at that base beginning level of violence,
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.060]   there's a big risk.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:21.860]   So, I know that we live in this place with healthcare,
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.020]   or you might be in a place with nationalized health,
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:24.860]   whatever, right?
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:29.860]   There's Band-Aids, there's penicillin,
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.420]   there's all that kind of stuff.
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:36.100]   But that's not the normal way of things.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:40.580]   - There's a channel that just hurts me every time.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.980]   I used to follow, and I had to unfollow it
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.660]   'cause it was too painful for me as a human being
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.300]   called Nature Is Metal on Instagram.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:51.180]   It was sobering, and then it was like, this is too sobering.
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.900]   - It's very sobering.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.500]   - So, in there, the risk is at its highest level.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:01.500]   The damage you take, the winner walks away hurt.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:06.460]   - Getting lamed when you need every aspect
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:10.780]   of your physical and athletic faculties to survive
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.900]   because is it gonna be the, this isn't the first,
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.540]   and it's definitely not gonna be the last,
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.380]   especially if you're the slowest one.
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.180]   What is it?
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:23.740]   It's a lyric from a clutch song.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.820]   Don't go for the fat ones, just go for the slow ones.
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.900]   (laughing)
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:33.220]   - Oh, man, but that universal truth of the way nature works.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.300]   You said it's not cruel, it's just the way it is.
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.980]   - Yeah, I mean, watch animals get into fights
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.900]   on any of these sort of documentary stuff.
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.980]   You'll see an intense, short, and then dispersal.
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.900]   Like, you'll see as soon as one feels like,
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.780]   oh, things have switched just enough,
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.980]   boom, the bear or whatever it is takes off.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.740]   It's like, I'm not, I'm done with this.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.380]   Because if you can get out of there
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.260]   with just some scars and what have you, okay.
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:01.460]   You lose an eye, nah, it's not as good.
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.980]   You really get hurt bad and get infected, you're done.
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.900]   So there's a serious risk to be,
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.860]   that can come with these sort of things.
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:15.860]   Yet, I believe that we are inherently born
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:19.820]   for at least aspects of use of violence.
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.580]   And so at the end of the day,
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:26.180]   we need these things not just to survive each other,
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:30.420]   but they're a part of being able to hunt and other things.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.340]   - So violence is a part of human nature.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.060]   - Violence is, it's an absolute.
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.700]   It is in every person, it is a part of every interaction,
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.660]   it is a part of every law, everything.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.900]   And I'm not, by the way, I'm not an ANCAP,
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:47.220]   so don't hit your wagon to me on that one.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.780]   - ANCAP is anarchic capitalist.
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.740]   - Anarchic capitalist, yes.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.460]   Not an ANCAP.
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.460]   - They have nice book shops.
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.300]   - Yeah, they do.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:59.500]   I mean, I'm not gonna sit here and shit talk ANCAPs.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.580]   Although I also used to get into the conversations
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:06.580]   with an ANCOM, anarcho-communist, a good friend of mine,
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:11.300]   and he would bring up this stuff and I'm like,
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.640]   "Yeah, cool, man, I'm down with anarchy.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.220]   "You ain't gonna like it."
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.060]   What do you mean?
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.220]   I go, 'cause I'm gonna take all,
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.820]   I'm gonna gather all kinds of people together.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.700]   I'm gonna make this, I'm gonna get the strongest together
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.500]   and I'm going to take your shit.
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.140]   - Okay, can I ask you, on that topic,
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.680]   I have a friend of mine now,
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:33.580]   a fellow Russian, Ukrainian, Michael Malice.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.580]   - Oh, yeah, I'm familiar with Michael Malice.
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:38.660]   I watched a little bit of your guys' conversation.
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.600]   - So this is really good to ask you because--
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.340]   - I like how he's in the white suit
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.820]   and you're in the white and black.
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.580]   But he lives in New York City.
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.260]   He espouses ideas of anarchism.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.740]   And his idea, and this is different
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:00.500]   than sort of the Ayn Rand set of ideas,
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.700]   that there's a line between sort of capitalism
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.720]   that's backed by the state and just pure anarchism.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:11.580]   And his idea that violence won't take over in an anarchism
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:18.100]   is one that feels to me not grounded in reality.
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.700]   I may be wrong.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.700]   So is there some, so the idea with pure capitalism is that--
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:28.100]   - You mean laissez-faire, completely deregulated?
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.900]   Yeah, well, what it will agree, it'll end up in,
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.260]   one, it'll end up in, if you're anti-globalist,
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.700]   it's gonna be that.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:40.140]   It's gonna be globalist 100% because it has no,
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.920]   pure capitalism has no consideration for,
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:49.420]   has no consideration for your native users or of any sort.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.020]   Like it doesn't-- - Yeah, land doesn't matter.
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.300]   But the idea of governments is that the land,
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.380]   the little piece of land geographically you're born on
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.620]   means you're going to stick to whatever founding documents
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.060]   created that little land.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.120]   So anarchism is against that.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.260]   And the argument is you should be able to choose
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:09.040]   which ideas you live with.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.380]   And the concern there is nobody,
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.940]   this geographical little land, the governments
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:19.720]   that organize on that land will not,
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.860]   do not need to protect you from the violence.
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:24.040]   And my sense is there does need to be an army,
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.660]   there does need to be police that help,
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.460]   however the form that police takes.
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.060]   But there needs to be a more centralized,
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.180]   not completely centralized, but more centralized
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:39.400]   safety net of to protect you from the violence.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.440]   - Scale again, right?
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.760]   So if you want to have your anarchist utopia,
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.280]   well, we won't call it utopia,
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.140]   your anarchist creation here.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.740]   At certain scale, I'm sure it's doable, you know?
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:58.440]   But as it scales, as the scale increases,
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.060]   it's completely untenable and a state will emerge.
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.880]   A state will always emerge. - A state will always emerge.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.980]   - 'Cause even, people always think of states
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.680]   as people rubbing their hands and smoking cigars
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.440]   in back rooms and just out of nowhere coming around
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.640]   and just like, oh, we're gonna create
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.680]   this big centralized thing and just so that we can
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:17.920]   tell everybody what to do and we can be in charge.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.920]   I mean, I know that there are people like that that exist,
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.280]   that they would like to do things of that nature
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.760]   and that they see the use of power
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:31.760]   as something to be used more for their personal gains
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.160]   over first, which again, self-interest and human beings.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:41.160]   But eventually, people want, they want something to go like,
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.440]   okay, who's taking care of this
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.840]   and who's taking care of that?
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:51.840]   And how do we create some sort of protocol for this?
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:56.080]   Like, okay, well, when it's not Bob, when is it Susie?
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:56.920]   When is it whatever?
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.720]   I mean, like how do we, it's gotta get done
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.120]   if we want this thing to become bigger,
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.520]   if we want all of our plumbing to work right,
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.920]   if we want, it's just, I'm sorry, a state's gonna happen.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.720]   A state is also, when you think about it,
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.580]   is supposed to have consideration to tribe, right?
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.880]   So if people think that we're not tribes,
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.960]   well, you're not really thinking very deeply.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.640]   We're all tribes of a sort.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.960]   And everybody likes to use the word tribalism
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.280]   and this idea of this antagonistic concept.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.520]   But, and while sure, tribalism can be antagonistic,
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.520]   tribalism can also be a positive thing,
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.080]   or I could just say it just seems to be a natural thing.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:40.160]   People, they create their groups of one sort or another.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   And so when you have, well, when you think about
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.840]   when nation states really started to become a thing,
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:52.160]   and I don't mean even the more modern-looking variants
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.640]   that we could think back of in, say, the 19th century
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.480]   or something like that.
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.480]   Even older than that.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.480]   I mean, you think the Assyrians
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.120]   didn't have a state of some sort?
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.020]   Of course they did.
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:05.120]   How do you increase your empire
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.320]   if you don't actually have a place to start from?
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.160]   - It has to be a ruler.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.800]   So you're saying like naturally,
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.160]   when you start talking and thinking about scale of humans,
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.360]   naturally states emerge.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.760]   And can we try to make an argument for anarchism,
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.600]   which is--
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.680]   - Uh.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.280]   - Okay, okay, okay.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.760]   (laughing)
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:30.000]   So anarchy in a sense is an opposition
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.160]   to the unhelpful, unproductive, inefficient bureaucracies
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.000]   that eventually the states lead to.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.400]   - Yes, and that's, we can see, I mean,
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:44.400]   I would say less anarchy, more study James Burnham.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:51.960]   Or, well, anybody that wants to talk about
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.520]   the managerial problem and the manager--
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.020]   - I see, so you have a sense, a hope,
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.360]   maybe let's think like what is the path forward
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.200]   with the inefficient state?
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.520]   Is it revolution or is it to work within the system
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.960]   to constantly improve it, to manage--
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.320]   - Man, I don't know that one.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.680]   I mean, my general sense,
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.560]   and maybe this is the Nietzschean part of me,
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.560]   is that yeah, it would take,
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.920]   maybe not even just,
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.120]   maybe not even defining it specifically as revolution.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.040]   Maybe it would just take just total calamity
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.920]   to get people to stop being--
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.760]   - To pick people up.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.580]   - To not stop being a lesser version of themselves,
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:35.580]   to stop thinking more about things from the paradigm
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:39.540]   that we exist in now where we're giving so much value
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.180]   to stuff that isn't really all that valuable.
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.140]   We're so concerned about likes,
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.580]   and I don't just mean whether we get 'em or not,
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:50.420]   but that, oh man, maybe we should take this off
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.220]   of our platform 'cause this is too destabilizing to people.
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.860]   'Cause once you exceed Dunbar's number,
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:59.860]   I think it's actually, without having the right faculties,
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.400]   which would need to be developed
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:08.160]   because this is dealing with tech that brings things,
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:13.160]   ways of approaching being that we are not naturally programmed
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:17.920]   to be able to handle appropriately.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:22.360]   So, and I think it's even more detrimental
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.260]   to women than men because I think women
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:31.260]   have a more natural proclivity towards group association
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:37.380]   and more group-oriented thinking and patterning.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:43.260]   And now, and also coupled with seemingly more sensitivity
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:49.700]   towards human states.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.800]   So I feel like women, the classic idea is like,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.860]   oh, women are psychic, you have a sixth sense
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:55.700]   and what have you.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:00.700]   And I think that's just a way of simplifying
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:05.260]   what I think is that women may be more in tune
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.560]   with picking up on the unsaid.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:12.560]   Like they might be better at seeing physical cues,
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.220]   inflection and tone, like different,
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:16.560]   like they may be far more sensitive to these things,
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.580]   which to me would make sense
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:22.580]   because dealing with children that can't communicate.
[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.700]   So, so--
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.900]   - It's generally more empathetic
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:26.740]   in all the full forms of human interaction.
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:29.860]   - Right, now, okay, now, whether it be a woman or a man,
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:34.340]   but especially with even the social push
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.820]   on this concept of empathy, which of course,
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.220]   it gets to the point where it loses any meaning anymore.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.060]   Like people use the word empathy
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.580]   absolutely incorrectly all the time
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.140]   and they don't even understand
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:47.020]   what you're really asking of people.
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.740]   But let's just take it as we're using empathy
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:51.960]   in the correct sense and you're taking on
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.320]   the emotional content of the thing itself.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.940]   Now you open that up to thousands of people,
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:01.420]   maybe hundreds of thousands of people all across the world
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:03.340]   that you will never meet, that you will never know,
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.680]   that you're not even getting an actual true representation
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.420]   most of the time of who these people are.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.880]   You're meeting persona.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:15.680]   And some of these personas are even deliberately created
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:20.020]   to elicit a response inauthentically.
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.260]   - Are you referring to bots or artists?
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.260]   - Could be bots or actual people.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.580]   Bots are one thing, but I mean,
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.180]   there are literal people out there
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:30.420]   that will create something, create GoFundMes
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.460]   for tragedies that never didn't really,
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:36.520]   or events that didn't happen or any number of things.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.580]   Okay, I mean, burn their own house down
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.540]   and then say, you know, we were attacked.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:42.820]   And then it comes down, oh, you did it to yourself
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.420]   because you wanted money and empathy and this, that,
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.480]   and you wanted all this emotional wealth,
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.420]   let's say, this emotional coin,
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.900]   as well as actual if possible.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.240]   You wanted to leverage it in some way.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.140]   That's not the majority of people,
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:01.080]   but I would say a good amount of folks are thinking,
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.980]   well, if I post this photo
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:07.140]   and I put this little blurb in there,
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.560]   I bet I can get this much cache out of it in this sense.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.480]   And I'm not even, and this isn't just a reference
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.700]   to like butt pics and stuff like that,
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:17.460]   because clearly, obviously, people understand
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:22.460]   that our inborn sexual nature is easy to manipulate.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:25.780]   I mean, that's pretty obvious.
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.820]   - But you're saying this kind of new medium
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:32.220]   of communication on social media is unnatural.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.340]   - And it preys on us.
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:36.300]   And so as you want this, you know,
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:41.300]   you look at an anarchist kind of mindset, right?
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:46.660]   And so it's just like, there is no overarching state
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:51.820]   to create any kind of structure, right?
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:56.500]   And so if you have that unfettered capitalism aspect with it
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:00.140]   and before I say anything particularly damning
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:03.980]   about unfettered capitalism, I'm a massive capitalist
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:06.620]   because I view capitalism essentially as,
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.060]   what it boils down to, I get these arguments
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:10.980]   from people too, they start giving me
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:12.660]   all these extra definitions about capitalism.
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.260]   Like, no, no, this is obviously some sort of theory
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:16.300]   you're taking from other shit,
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.620]   but that doesn't describe capitalism.
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:22.620]   Capitalism is the ability for us to create whatever we want,
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:27.260]   or, you know, create our thoughts, ideas, physical things,
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.740]   and trade them freely amongst each other
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:34.300]   in ways that we find acceptable, right?
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.460]   You know, I'm not even using the word fair
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.100]   'cause I might think it's fair to me,
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:41.380]   you might think, huh, well, I mean, that was actually,
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.580]   I think what he thought was unfair to him
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:44.700]   and it's more fair to me.
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.620]   And then someone, a third observer goes,
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:49.260]   oh man, you should not have paid that for that,
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:50.100]   you should have paid this.
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.140]   And it's like, well, you know what, it works for me.
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.380]   - Sufficiently acceptable that you both agree
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.780]   to the transaction. - Correct.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:01.580]   And, you know, but also at the root of that is freedom,
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.740]   right, and as far as I can tell,
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:06.260]   I've been banging this around in my head,
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.060]   it's like for every one unit of freedom,
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.380]   you need two units of accountability.
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:16.140]   And if you don't have that, what you end up with is,
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:20.060]   is human self-interest,
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.660]   we're not even gonna get into evil,
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.840]   human self-interest, sabotaging other things,
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.060]   even not in a sense to be malicious.
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.860]   - Okay, so in terms of,
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.340]   let's put this as mathematically speaking,
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:35.420]   I love this, so anarchism is more like two units of freedom
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:37.380]   than one unit of accountability,
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:38.980]   or maybe zero units of accountability.
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:40.980]   - Possibly, I mean, the anarchists tend to think like,
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:42.260]   no, everyone will be accountable,
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.940]   it's like, fuck they will,
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:46.060]   when have you seen this happen in real life?
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:47.760]   You know, I mean, people aren't even accountable
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.620]   in their revolutions half the time.
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:54.620]   So you aren't looking at the way people really are,
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:58.740]   it's like Marx is like, yeah, people are like this,
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.740]   they're like that, look at how capitalism does it.
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.780]   I mean, he of course assigns a lot of really
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:06.780]   ridiculous economic principles and practice,
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:11.340]   but also assumes that everybody who makes any profit
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.940]   from anything is somehow stealing it,
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.980]   really assigns a negative moral aspect to them,
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.400]   and then it's like, oh yeah, but then eventually,
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.660]   communism will happen, no one will act that way anymore,
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:21.780]   and you're like, whoa, hold on,
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.500]   you just said that people are all,
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.900]   are you saying it's all due to capitalism,
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:29.060]   or is it innate, it's just,
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.660]   it's a fundamental misunderstanding of,
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:35.140]   and it's like, hey, look at you,
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:39.540]   you're like a notorious, anti-Semitic, angry,
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:43.900]   just absolute curmudgeon of a human being
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.780]   who seems to be really not all that fun to be around.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.620]   - Marx? - Yeah, and then it's just like--
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:49.580]   - So you have to think like,
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:52.780]   if there was one billion Marxists in the world,
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.620]   how would they behave? - They would all,
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:54.940]   it would be absolute terror.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.060]   (laughing)
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.340]   They would hate each other so bad,
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:02.020]   and this isn't for me to even poison the well on Marx,
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:03.860]   it's like, oh, his personality sucks.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.740]   There's lots of people whose personality sucks.
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:07.300]   That doesn't mean they can't make,
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.780]   I don't know that his, what?
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:10.900]   - You know what, somebody argued--
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.660]   - He's just a loner, I mean,
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.940]   I don't know if his personality sucked at all.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.580]   - Let me walk that back in that he was human.
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.420]   Say his personality sucked,
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:23.120]   he was sometimes contradictory, irrational,
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:27.460]   sometimes he was quite sexist,
[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.500]   despite the emails I've gotten.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.140]   - Despite the emails I've gotten.
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.300]   - That told me that,
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:37.100]   this people was written to me
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:40.660]   that Nietzsche has been unfairly labeled a sexist
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:43.320]   in his discussion about women.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.760]   I'm pretty sure there's a bunch of documents
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.380]   where he's just like,
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:51.300]   he's just a bitter guy.
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:52.660]   - I will agree with you,
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.620]   and Marx is as bitter as they come to,
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:58.740]   but you know what, bitterness in and of itself
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:49:59.900]   doesn't make,
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:04.900]   like, why I hate Marxism comes from the whole,
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:08.660]   the entirety of the thing, but--
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.140]   - The dismissal of human nature.
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:14.860]   - But I'm not going to say that Marxism,
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:18.740]   or, man, you can find any forbidden book
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.660]   and it could have something good in it.
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:21.700]   - His kernel's a good idea.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.900]   - Yeah, and at the end of the day,
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.860]   Marx is a human being.
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:26.700]   - He's got a nice beard.
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.500]   - Yeah, he does, he had a hell of a beard.
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.740]   Yeah, a decent portrait.
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:31.860]   I mean, he looks like the kind of guy,
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.460]   I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley,
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.740]   but thankfully, I don't think he was much of a fighter.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.580]   (both laughing)
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:40.020]   But in any case, I mean, not the anarchists,
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:44.820]   or they're more hot for, like, Max Stirner.
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:47.540]   People like to think that Nietzsche
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:48.740]   borrowed a lot from Stirner,
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:50.620]   and my argument is, one,
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.500]   you don't have any real evidence for that,
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.100]   and two, bullshit.
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:51:01.100]   The fact that they have some overlapping thoughts
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.980]   doesn't make it lifted.
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.740]   Not to mention, go read more philosophy
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.620]   and see how there's so many different things.
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:12.220]   Oh, this guy said it in 1722.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:15.100]   Well, and then this guy says it again in 1922.
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.600]   Does that mean he read the other guy's stuff?
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:17.500]   Not necessarily.
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.260]   I mean, he's working from the same type
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:23.620]   of human physiological construct as anybody else.
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:25.260]   Like, of course it's possible
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:26.500]   that this guy could think the same thing.
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.380]   We think a lot of the same things, to be perfectly honest.
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:31.540]   I mean, reading the Hagakure,
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.380]   going back to philosophy books,
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:36.380]   this was really impactful on me as a younger adult,
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:39.020]   because here's a book written in the 19th century
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.820]   about someone who lived through the 19th
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:45.460]   and 18th century at times, as a samurai, now a monk,
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:48.980]   and his objections to society at the time,
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.980]   the same objections one was having to society
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:53.160]   as I was reading it.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.500]   Like, the same human behaviors,
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:52:00.500]   the same impetus for action that he found a problem.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:06.580]   Like, well, that's the same shit now.
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:11.140]   And this was the thing, and then I'm reading more religion,
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:13.140]   I go, oh, we're no different
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:16.140]   than anyone who wrote the Torah or older.
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.740]   We are the same thing with the same problems
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.420]   with the same psychological issues,
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:22.660]   the same human behaviors.
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:24.980]   Like, these things are not different,
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:26.060]   and we haven't changed.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:29.180]   - Growing set of tools, though, to kill each other with
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:31.260]   or to communicate together and all that kind of stuff,
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.740]   but underlying it, there's a human nature.
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:35.620]   Well, we're also trying to understand that human nature.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:37.460]   I think we've, just like you said,
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:39.820]   learning how to fish, acquired more and more knowledge
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:44.300]   about that human nature, but it's been a very slow journey.
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.860]   It's slower than people realize.
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:46.780]   - Yes.
[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:49.060]   - In terms of understanding human nature.
[00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:51.140]   Let me ask, in terms of egoism,
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:56.140]   it'd be curious to get your sense about Ayn Rand
[00:52:56.140 --> 00:53:01.740]   and her whole idea of virtue of selfishness and her,
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:06.860]   because you mentioned that everybody has a kernel of truth.
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.900]   There's potential for a kernel of truth
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.660]   to be discovered in anything.
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:14.460]   For example, I've been recently reading Mein Kampf.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.260]   You know what, that's the thing.
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.380]   Even, there's something in,
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:22.900]   there's probably things in Mein Kampf
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:25.860]   that are not the surface-level read.
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:29.580]   If you get all hung up on probably all his crap about,
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:34.260]   his anger at Jews and this and that, all this crap,
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:36.900]   it's like, okay, yeah, that's right on the surface.
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.860]   Try to get below that.
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:43.860]   Try to see, how is he creating the Jews as a cope somehow?
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:46.820]   Like, how is he using, why are they his scapegoat?
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:49.180]   And I mean scapegoat in the,
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.980]   so René Girard's concept of the scapegoat,
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:52.980]   I mean it in that sense,
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:57.980]   whereas Hitler uses, wants to make the Jews
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.300]   the scapegoat for World War I.
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.980]   - Yeah, I mean, for me, the starting point,
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:04.700]   similar with Ayn Rand, is,
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:08.180]   like, Mein Kampf is not a good place to search,
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:09.780]   not just because Hitler is evil,
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.820]   but it's just not full of ideas.
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:13.460]   - No, it is not.
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:16.260]   It has its significance due to a lot of things.
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:17.100]   - Historically speaking.
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:17.940]   - Yeah, but--
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:20.500]   - The starting point for me with Hitler is, like,
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.180]   to acknowledge that he's human
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:26.060]   and to at least consider the possibility
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:28.340]   that any one of us could have been Hitler.
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:29.180]   So, like, not to make--
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:31.540]   - Well, that's a Peterson kind of concept.
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:35.020]   Also, Jonathan Haidt has a thing about
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:38.500]   the difference between hate and disgust mechanisms
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:39.900]   and things like that, and so he used,
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:43.180]   he goes into the, looking at Hitler
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.580]   and his, through his diary entries
[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:46.580]   and journals and stuff like that,
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:50.140]   to look and see it more as the disgust mechanism
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:51.460]   than also try and see, like,
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.220]   if there's any evolutionary, biological
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:56.700]   attachment to this, whatever.
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:59.380]   I mean, you're right, he is a human being.
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:02.140]   Any of us are, we're all human beings.
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:03.740]   It's not that,
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:07.780]   it's probably jarring for people to think,
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:12.380]   but we're all, I guess, supposed,
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:14.860]   potentially capable of just being in,
[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:17.100]   and all these evil people in the world
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:19.780]   think they're doing it for the sake of good,
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:22.820]   which makes them the most dangerous.
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.580]   - And there's some, there's differences
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.580]   in levels of insane.
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:29.340]   I think Hitler was way more insane than Stalin.
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:33.780]   I think Stalin legitimately thought he was doing good.
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:36.100]   - I would say that's probably true.
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:40.420]   Stalin was just outright brutal.
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.340]   Like, he had his five-year plan,
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.980]   he had all those other things.
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:46.740]   - He just had a much lower value for human life.
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:47.580]   - Yes.
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:48.980]   - And so he was willing to take,
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.420]   make decisions about what he actually,
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:53.900]   as a good executive,
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:59.420]   which he was, of managing different bureaucracies and so on,
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:01.100]   he was willing to make decisions
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:04.600]   that resulted in mass human suffering,
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:09.600]   where Hitler was, it seems like to me, much moodier.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.940]   So a lot of emotions and moods to make decisions.
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:15.100]   - I think we also have to consider
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.860]   the different trajectories,
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:19.540]   and how, where, and when they were making their decisions.
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:21.500]   And I mean, not by time specifically,
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:24.460]   but Hitler engaged into this conflict
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.340]   across multiple continents.
[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:30.540]   And then that, everything that comes with,
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:32.680]   basically, fighting the whole world,
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.580]   Stalin had his conflict,
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:41.580]   and then he really mostly compartmentalized the rest of it.
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:43.700]   So he was dealing with his own internal
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:46.400]   instead of dealing with the internal and the external.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.980]   So if Stalin was put under a World War scenario,
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:50.180]   I don't know, maybe he would've
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:52.140]   eventually lost his marbles too.
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:54.980]   - Yeah, I'm not sure that, that's, you're right.
[00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:58.660]   The hunger for power was more internalized for Stalin.
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:01.140]   He wanted to control the land that already existed
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:03.140]   as opposed to wanting to colonize other land.
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:05.780]   He was as nationalistic as Hitler,
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:10.580]   but, and was as capable and willing
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:13.460]   for violent conflict as Hitler
[00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:16.140]   for the aims of the state.
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:22.740]   But he centered and internalized
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:26.940]   prior to then externalizing and moving outwards.
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:28.940]   Whereas even maybe prior to him,
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:31.940]   there was an interest to continually push communism
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:34.420]   in an aggressive sense, following on the momentum
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:37.940]   from the, what, 1918 revolution.
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:42.940]   And that, the halting of that through various aspects,
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:46.740]   I guess, in Germany, part of that was
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:47.860]   the National Socialists.
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.220]   They came up and then they were the other ones
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:51.140]   to fight the communists,
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:54.300]   and so you had the two totalitarians going after it.
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:55.960]   But then in the rest of the world
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:00.960]   that was not dealing with totalitarian aspects,
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:02.940]   it was just, it wasn't gonna stick,
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:04.860]   especially in the West and other places.
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:09.220]   But Stalin, just casually thinking,
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.460]   it seemed like Stalin decided to go,
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:12.820]   all right, well, we're not gonna go
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:15.180]   just start launching right into more conflicts here.
[00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.420]   We're gonna, these dudes are going down,
[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:20.760]   so that's cool for us 'cause they hate us and we hate them.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:25.000]   But now we're gonna focus internally,
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.260]   and then we're gonna work on growing at a slower rate
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:30.380]   and picking our battles a bit more specifically.
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:33.080]   And of course, there's, you can get to the,
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.340]   even this is after Stalin,
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:36.580]   but you got the Beslanov type stuff
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:40.860]   talking about subversion in cultural aspects.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:42.900]   - Yeah, I mean, there's fascinating dynamics
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.300]   to propaganda throughout the whole period that's--
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:47.220]   - Yeah, it's a whole 'nother kernel, yeah.
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:50.060]   - Do you think Hitler could have been stopped?
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:53.780]   One of the things that's kind of fascinating to look at
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:58.080]   is how many nations, both journalists and nations,
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:01.100]   wanted, almost craved to take Hitler at his word
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:04.500]   that he wanted peace until it was too late.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:08.540]   They almost wanted to delude themselves.
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:11.800]   I mean, the same is true with Stalin.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.780]   People wanted to take Stalin at his word for--
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:15.020]   - Oh, they still delude themselves.
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:17.620]   - Yeah. - We will delude ourselves
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:21.540]   over any number of things until even after the fact
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:23.860]   where the history just says, hey, fuck face.
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:27.580]   You cannot supplement your pseudo-reality
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:29.380]   onto actual reality here.
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:34.080]   But yet, we deal with people in pseudo-realities constantly.
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:38.820]   We will always find a way to change reality
[00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:40.140]   to suit our needs.
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:41.360]   - Well, the nature of truth now,
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.020]   there's now multiple actual truths.
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:44.140]   It's kind of fascinating.
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:46.740]   There's multiple versions of history
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:47.940]   that people are telling.
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:52.980]   The version of the Great Patriotic War in Russia,
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:54.740]   the World War II in Russia,
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:57.020]   is very different today under Putin
[00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:01.060]   than the version that we're learning in the United States
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.740]   and different than the version in Europe.
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.920]   In the United States,
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.700]   the hero of the war is the United States.
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:11.780]   In Europe, there's a much more sad and solemn story
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.940]   of suffering and so on.
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:14.260]   - Sure. - In Russia,
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.420]   it's the Great-- - Patriotic War.
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.540]   - Yes. - It was a unifier
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.380]   of a sense.
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.800]   And it, I mean,
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.580]   yeah, I mean, you can't argue
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.220]   that war and conflict that,
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:32.260]   and/or just even reducing that to stressors,
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:36.620]   agitation, suffering, doesn't create human motivation.
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.780]   We started this off, you brought up Frankel.
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.540]   I'm like, yeah, Frankel's dope.
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.060]   Man's search for meaning.
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.420]   Maslow's great.
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:46.940]   And I talked to you about how I started to think,
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:50.820]   like, man, the ability for human beings
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:54.700]   to live and/or potentially flourish
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:57.620]   in the worst environments you can think of
[01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.980]   is pretty incredible in and of itself.
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:03.060]   And that it's a crazy thought
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:07.860]   to think that without Frankel and Maslow
[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.140]   ending up in concentration camps,
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:13.900]   do they write some of the most important books
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:16.260]   on philosophy in the 20th century?
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:20.060]   And that's insane on a lot of different levels.
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.540]   But-- - Yeah, suffering
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.500]   is a creative force.
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.220]   I mean, I don't, do you think we'll always have war?
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:28.900]   - Yes, we will always have war in some form or another.
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:32.700]   We need, quote-unquote, air quotes,
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:36.100]   for those just listening, war to survive.
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.380]   We need war to flourish.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.060]   We need at least-- - Can you explain
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:42.340]   the air quotes around war? - Well, because take,
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:46.380]   take the-- - You see wars as violence?
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.660]   - No, wars are not violence.
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:48.500]   - So like, so when we're talking about--
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.820]   - No, air quotes, because while, you know what,
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.780]   us getting on the mat or just getting
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:55.020]   on these hardwood floors and wrestling around
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:58.540]   is not literal war, it's war of a sorts.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:01.980]   You know, it is a diluted form of war.
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:03.940]   American football is a diluted form of war.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.900]   All this, these are diluted forms of war.
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.880]   Tennis is a diluted form of war.
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:12.620]   And I think one of the best explanations
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:16.620]   I ever got from this, another person very impactful
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:19.700]   on my life and outlook and thinking about things,
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.500]   Cormac McCarthy, and so in Blood Meridian,
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.780]   there's this fantastic speech about war given by the judge,
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:28.900]   which there's a ton of fantastic speeches
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:31.100]   on things given by the judge, yeah.
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:33.100]   All that exists in creation without my knowledge
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.700]   does so without my consent.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:36.820]   Whoa, okay, that's pretty heavy.
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.180]   That's hard.
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.180]   - Go ahead, can you break that up?
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.260]   Can you say that again?
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.580]   - All things that exist in creation,
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.300]   all things that exist without my knowledge
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.840]   do so without my consent.
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:50.500]   - What does that mean to you?
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.620]   - Well, I think from the judge's perspective,
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.500]   it's like, well, I didn't consent to that bird
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:59.820]   or that dog or this building or all this.
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:02.140]   Like, all of this, you know, I didn't create it,
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:03.860]   so it's done so without my consent.
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:05.740]   And if it's up to my consent,
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:08.100]   well, I'll design it how I want to.
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:11.540]   Another similar look into how the judge is in that book
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:16.540]   is he would study everything everywhere he went.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:20.980]   And so he's collected this group of Ne'er-do-wells
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:24.100]   from all over to go on these hunts
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:28.820]   against certain tribes in the Southwest
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:31.340]   and getting paid by the US government
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.860]   and the Mexican government.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:36.500]   So he's on these Indian hunts,
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:39.660]   and yet they're going to all these different places,
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:43.840]   and they would stay the night in a cave somewhere,
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.940]   and he would find cave paintings,
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.180]   and he would write them all down.
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:47.780]   Or he would find old pieces.
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:50.980]   There's an example of him, the narrator,
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:52.540]   explaining how watching the judge
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:54.220]   and how he's drawing everything.
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:56.660]   He's got this notebook just full of things,
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.900]   drawings and writings,
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:03.140]   and how he found a piece of armor from a conquistador
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:04.860]   or something way back in the day, a Spanish armor,
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:07.780]   and he draws it into his book and then crushes it.
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:13.380]   - And so the reason we'll always have war in this society
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:17.140]   is because there's this struggle amongst people
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.540]   that want to be the designers.
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:21.340]   - There's that, but I'm just saying
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.740]   that he's got this whole quote on war.
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.340]   Like, war is play.
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.460]   War is a game, and the difference is is that
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.660]   what's at stake?
[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:33.940]   So all things are a game of some sort,
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:35.500]   and you're putting up for it,
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.900]   or what you're willing to put up for it
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:40.180]   determines whether or not you're going to participate or not.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:45.180]   And all aspects of any game is war,
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:48.180]   and it's just what is at stake?
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.960]   If it's your life, it's a different story.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.340]   If it's just a coin, it's another thing.
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:56.380]   - A nice way to put it is humans play a game
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:00.700]   in this kind of pursuit of creating.
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.860]   Whatever the hell the reason is
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.220]   that we keep creating cooler and cooler things,
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:08.980]   that it seems to be the result of a game
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:11.460]   that we naturally play, we naturally crave.
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:14.660]   I don't know, I mean, that's been the struggle of philosophy
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:17.580]   is to understand what is the underlying force of all that.
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.220]   Is it the will to power?
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.500]   - I think will to power is a really great way
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.500]   of describing it.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.620]   - Do you want to be the winner of the game?
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:27.660]   - No, not just, no, I don't look at will to power
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:29.100]   as being the winner of the game.
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:31.680]   Well, I mean, if we're gonna get philosophical,
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.300]   yes, you want to be the winner of the game.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:36.220]   What does winning the game define how you win?
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.500]   Everybody's gonna define that win differently.
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.700]   You could define the win in the most base level
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.360]   like, oh, I got all the things.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:45.100]   Well, if you got all those things
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.660]   without the needing component of fulfillment,
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:50.420]   then you're gonna be a very unhappy person
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:51.420]   with a whole lot of things.
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:54.820]   - But there's a self-referential aspect to where, to me,
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.640]   the winner of the game is defined
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.540]   by the people playing the game.
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.600]   So if I'm playing a game,
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:06.060]   I want to win in the sense that most of the other people
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.860]   who are playing the game will say, yeah, that guy won.
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:11.340]   By our collective definition of,
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:13.420]   if I just come up, listen, I'm sort of,
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:14.260]   if I come up with my own--
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:17.540]   - Well, that's a lot of weight on the external on you.
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:21.100]   - Right, but that's how games seem to work.
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:21.940]   - Somewhat.
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:24.260]   - So I'm already a winner in my life
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.300]   by defining my own definition of success.
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.300]   (laughing)
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:32.060]   I'm basically the best person in the world at doing me.
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:32.900]   - At being Lex.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:35.740]   - Yeah, and I'm really happy with that.
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:37.220]   That's a source of happiness.
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:38.420]   - Well, I mean, think about it.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:40.480]   Games are also iterated, right?
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.860]   So you start off with your game,
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:45.500]   and then your game with your immediates,
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.020]   and then the game further than that,
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:47.980]   and the game further than that,
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:49.980]   and then the game today, and the game tomorrow,
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:52.540]   and the game next week, and so it never ends.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:55.020]   And if you try to keep thinking about it that way,
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:56.200]   no wonder people go crazy.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:59.100]   But we don't want to think about things that way.
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:01.540]   We don't want to think about being towards death.
[01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:04.860]   We don't want to think about whether or not
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:07.380]   I'm going anywhere after this other than in the ground
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:08.220]   or what have you.
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:12.020]   - All of these games are a sense of some distraction.
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:12.860]   This is where we brought up--
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:15.800]   - Kind of, but I mean, it's violence is that
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.620]   we need to let this out.
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:23.180]   And so it is of our, kids need to wrestle and play,
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:25.140]   just like animals need to wrestle and play.
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:27.460]   We need to have forms of competition.
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.820]   We need to have ways to test ourselves,
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:34.180]   to create, when, what is it?
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.860]   When at peace, a man of war makes war with himself.
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:39.720]   And so we need to be able to competently
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:42.380]   go at war with ourselves, and go at war with our neighbor,
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.380]   and go at war with our neighbor's neighbor
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:47.740]   in a way that is repeatable at the very least.
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:50.620]   - So one way of saying that there will always be war,
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:54.060]   I mean, that's my hopeful view,
[01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:56.740]   is that most of the war conducted in the future
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:57.980]   will be, like you said,
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:00.460]   the man must go to war with himself.
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.820]   - That would be great.
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.660]   That's what, to me, love is,
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:07.820]   is like focusing on yourself and your own improvement,
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:12.140]   and your own creativity, and towards others feeling,
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:15.860]   sort of emphasizing cooperative behavior,
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:19.420]   and compassion, and empathy.
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:21.780]   - It would be great, but I mean, you can have,
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.860]   well, I'll put it to you this way.
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:28.860]   If you have a whole community of Randians,
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:32.660]   and a whole community of ANCOMS,
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:37.100]   and they could all, like, I don't know,
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.660]   a toast of London on Netflix, and they love Netflix,
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:41.940]   and they love the internet,
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:46.940]   and they love picking apart Mon Camp with you.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:50.220]   They like all these things, even the esoteric
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:52.460]   that they can get on with.
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:55.700]   But at the fundamental root,
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.740]   they cannot help but go to war,
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.980]   because they are literally oil and water.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:01.580]   - No, but see, but they would,
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:05.780]   the very labels they assign to themselves
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:07.540]   would need to dissipate.
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:09.780]   - Well, true, well, then you would have to stop being
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:11.140]   whatever it is that you took on
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:14.860]   as your ideological or religious point, right?
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:18.300]   - Yeah, I mean, there's some days I'm a ANCOM,
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.780]   some days I'm an ANCAP,
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:24.780]   some, whatever the, an ARCA, an ARCA cap,
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:28.260]   I mean, it depends on the hour, the minute of the day,
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:31.240]   you're constantly changing moods and embracing that flow,
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:34.380]   the change of opinions, of ideas.
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:35.580]   As there's some days where, like,
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.300]   I'm actually cognizant of the fact,
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.180]   'cause I've been not getting much sleep,
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:41.460]   and after I get some sleep,
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:44.260]   I see I'm so much more optimistic about the world.
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:46.220]   The less and less sleep I get,
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.060]   the more sad and cynical I get.
[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:48.980]   - I can see that.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.300]   - Up and down, constantly.
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:54.140]   - I don't even let my, well, okay, I try not to let,
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:56.300]   and most days it's never a problem.
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:00.300]   Any sort of, like, what do the kids call it now,
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:03.820]   blackpilled way of thinking be my,
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:07.340]   my over, the umbrella which I hang under.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:10.880]   - So we actually, to drag us back,
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.540]   can we talk about Carl Gotch in Catch Wrestling?
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:15.900]   (laughing)
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:18.460]   'Cause I do wanna make sure I touch it.
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:20.380]   I mean, who were--
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:22.140]   - Carl Gotch is--
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:23.620]   - Is he the greatest catch wrestler?
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:26.860]   - I don't know if he was the greatest catch wrestler ever.
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:30.900]   I don't, I mean, he's one of them for a myriad of--
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:34.140]   Carl Gotch, Billy Robinson,
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:38.080]   Gotch and Robinson's trainer, Billy Riley.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.620]   - So who are these figures, and what do they bring to--
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.380]   - Mitsuo Maeda, he's one of the greatest
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.660]   catch wrestlers ever, because he's responsible
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:48.660]   for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, along with Cristal Gracie.
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:51.940]   - Okay, there's a bunch of things I'd like to say here,
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:54.180]   but one of the things that Catch Wrestling
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:57.940]   seemed to espouse as a principle is that of violence.
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:01.980]   I just, the tournaments I competed at,
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:04.460]   the unfortunate thing, and we'll probably,
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:06.300]   hopefully talk about it a little bit,
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:09.300]   they were disorganized, and the level of competition
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.180]   was pretty low, where people really sucked.
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:12.780]   - Pretty typical.
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:13.780]   - Is that typical, okay.
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:18.780]   - Well, it's, I mean, think about local, run-of-the-mill
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:22.700]   Jiu-Jitsu tournament versus IBJJF created,
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:24.700]   you know, a vast difference, so.
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:28.820]   - So I, you know, but there is a, to me as a human being,
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:31.900]   like intellectually, philosophically,
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:33.860]   it was more interesting to go to a Catch Wrestling
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:37.020]   tournament, it seemed more real and honest,
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:39.980]   because of the way they communicate about violence
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:40.820]   and aggression, and so--
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:44.180]   - I love that, it is often more honest.
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:45.020]   I think that as--
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:46.980]   - Who is that from, does that originate from Gotch
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.140]   and then Billy Robinson, Maeda?
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:50.140]   - Well, it originates from all wrestling,
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:54.260]   in that, even Wade Chalice, not a,
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:59.740]   not a classically considered Catch Wrestler,
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:02.660]   yet the reason why he has the world record
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:05.300]   for most amount of world champions pinned,
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:09.460]   or the record for pins in the NCAA, is because,
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:11.740]   well, of course the idea is to put you on your back
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:15.380]   and pin you, but there's no way you're gonna let me do that.
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:20.100]   So, how do I make it so that you want me to pin you?
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:23.020]   Well, it's by you putting me in excruciating pain.
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:27.380]   So, at the end of the day, you're both there,
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.820]   you both wanna win, neither one wants to allow anything
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:35.820]   to the other, so how do I get you to lose to me?
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:38.900]   I make it so unbearable for you that you decide
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:40.260]   losing is better than staying.
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:42.500]   - So those two are so fascinating,
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.700]   because, so coming from Russia,
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:46.580]   I don't know if that's where I got it,
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:49.620]   or if it's just my own predisposition,
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:53.380]   is I always loved the, there's two ways
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:55.720]   to get you to want to pin yourself.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:59.180]   One is to making it so painful not to pin yourself
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:01.020]   that you pin yourself, or whatever,
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:04.860]   and the other is, it's sort of like Bruce Lee water flows,
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:07.540]   make it so easy to pin yourself.
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:10.020]   So, it's technique, it's like the elegance,
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:13.620]   the ease of movement, this is the Satie brothers,
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:18.100]   Vova, Sietse, Satie, just the elegance,
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:18.940]   the efficiency, the chess.
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:20.260]   - Yeah, they're practically like ballet,
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:21.700]   watching those guys, it's incredible,
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:23.340]   Satie brothers are massive.
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:25.500]   - So those are the two pests, right?
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.020]   - I'll also caveat a little bit that,
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:31.940]   if you're approaching this from a Russian perspective,
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:36.620]   Russians are quite truthful about things,
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:38.460]   especially when it comes to something like combat.
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:41.060]   They just, this is how it is,
[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:42.220]   and this is how it's going to be.
[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.420]   - It's honest. - Yes.
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:46.660]   - And honesty is what I really like about catch wrestling,
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:48.820]   because I find that we,
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:51.260]   given any opportunity for us to be dishonest,
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.540]   for any number of reasons, we're gonna,
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:57.540]   especially if it's a dishonesty towards a positive, right?
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:00.060]   Like, oh, well, it's all technique, and it's all this,
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.480]   and it's the gentle art, and blah.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:06.880]   Bro, I have rolled with ADCC world champions,
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:09.100]   some of the best you have ever heard of.
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:12.100]   There ain't a lot of gentleness when it comes to like,
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.220]   oh, yeah, they wanted to sweep you, and you said no,
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:17.100]   and then you did said no again,
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:19.940]   and then you said no and attacked their leg.
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:21.700]   It ceases to be all that gentle,
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:23.060]   because at the end of the day,
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:25.860]   these dudes are strong as hell, they're flexible.
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:27.320]   They're all, I mean, they're,
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.420]   the difference between the athleticism
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:34.420]   and the ability to actually win is a pretty wide gap.
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:37.220]   The athleticism shows up,
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:39.460]   but then there's all that other extra,
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:42.500]   and part of that is meanness and pain
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:45.460]   and getting what you need out of it.
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:48.000]   - But see, there is a philosophical difference
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.700]   in the way it's thought, 'cause--
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:53.300]   - I think some of it is just, they're just in denial.
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:55.140]   Like, oh, people will, they like to,
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:57.620]   people like to espouse a lot of things as theory,
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:59.500]   and then it's like, okay, let me watch.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.100]   Oh, you're not doing anything about what you said right now.
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:03.620]   In fact, you're doing the opposite.
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.700]   You're literally hurting that guy
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:09.300]   because your shit ain't working,
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.700]   in the way that you'd like it to.
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:12.060]   So you're having to use strength.
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:13.300]   You're having to, it's one of my favorites.
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.660]   It's like, oh, you're using too much strength.
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:16.300]   And it's like, well, hold on.
[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:18.940]   Do we want people not to use strength at this point
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:21.300]   to understand more of mechanics?
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.540]   Or are you trying to tell people
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.980]   if they use strength at all
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:26.740]   that they're somehow bad at what they do?
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:28.340]   'Cause, you know, it's not my fault
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:29.180]   you're not stronger than me.
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:32.740]   - But see, I'm speaking of something else that's--
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.540]   - I tend to think what it comes down to is like,
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:37.740]   strength is fine until you beat me with it.
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:38.780]   Then it sucks.
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:41.100]   - Okay, so strength is another thing.
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:44.620]   I'm thinking about more like anger.
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:45.820]   - Oh, sure.
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:47.700]   So you have a lot of angry guys in jiu-jitsu.
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:48.860]   I know that.
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:49.700]   - Really?
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:50.540]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:51.360]   - Okay, good.
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.200]   But let's talk about-- - Tons of 'em.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.020]   - Let's talk about-- - They're only human.
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.340]   - The highest level of competition.
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:56.900]   There's a book called "Wrestling Tough."
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:57.740]   - Yeah.
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.060]   - It's a really good book.
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:01.900]   I've encountered in my life a few,
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:02.900]   especially in wrestling,
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:07.900]   people who really try to find a way to use anger,
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.300]   to get really angry at their opponent.
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.700]   Not like stupid anger, but just like--
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:17.700]   - Intense, pointed anger distilled into something
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:20.780]   that you can use as fuel.
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:22.540]   - And I remember this story.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.420]   I don't know where I read it.
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:24.780]   It might be "Wrestling Tough,"
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:28.220]   where a person was imagining that their opponent
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:29.860]   just raped their mother,
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:32.140]   raped their girlfriend or something like that,
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:35.060]   to create this method acting thing in their head
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:38.860]   to be like, to snap 'em out of this polite interaction
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:43.860]   of usual athletic convention and really go to the--
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:46.500]   - You know what, that's a design of necessity.
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:51.500]   So my anecdote for this was I was sitting with,
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:55.900]   backstage before a fight, not my fight,
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:57.340]   and I'm working with this guy,
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:00.980]   and this dude is, this is a world champion guy,
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:03.740]   and he's competed at the highest levels.
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:06.600]   And he looks at me and he goes,
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:11.540]   "You ever get nervous before fights?"
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:14.660]   I looked at him and I went, "No, I don't."
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:15.700]   And he just looks at me, he's like,
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.660]   "Fuck, man, I'm so nervous.
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:18.980]   "How do you do it, man?
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:19.820]   "I wish I could be like you."
[01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:21.220]   And I said, "You know what?
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:24.000]   "That doesn't mean that what I'm doing is better.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.940]   "It's just what is necessary for me.
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.420]   "It's the way I am."
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:31.500]   And I told him, so this anecdote goes into another anecdote.
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.220]   This is a "Family Guy" episode, I guess.
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:35.380]   (Lex laughing)
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:39.540]   Where another famous high-level guy told me
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:44.540]   about this experience with a world champion boxer in Japan.
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:48.660]   And this guy would get insanely nervous
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:51.500]   and worked up and anxious before his matches.
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.560]   And he hated it and hated it and hated it.
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:56.100]   And so he wanted to get rid of that feeling.
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:58.460]   So he went to a hypnotist for a bunch of sessions
[01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:01.020]   and managed to, and he goes in,
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:04.100]   and next fight, he's cool as a cucumber
[01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:06.260]   and doesn't perform and loses.
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:10.020]   And so what I said, going back to anecdote one,
[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:15.020]   was whatever is necessary for you to get yourself
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:18.200]   in the best state of being right now
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.540]   to compete, whatever that may be.
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:23.700]   It could be absolute stress and fear.
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:24.860]   It could be anger.
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:25.860]   It could be calmness.
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:26.820]   It could be whatever.
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:28.380]   But there is a-- - So brilliant.
[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:33.100]   - But there is a state at which you need to be in
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:34.420]   to do your best.
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:36.740]   - And you as the individual, you have to find that.
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:40.980]   Can you comment on Tyson, Mike Tyson?
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:42.220]   - Oh, yeah, that thing?
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:45.180]   - There's two things I wanna know.
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:48.620]   So he's, in terms of fear, there's a clip there,
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.580]   I think from a documentary, where he talks about
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:54.860]   he is fully afraid as he walks up to the ring.
[01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:56.420]   And as he gets closer and closer and closer,
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:58.660]   he gets more confident until he gets in
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:01.000]   and he's a god or something like that.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.740]   That coupled with his statement on Joe Rogan
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:10.140]   that he gets aroused at the possibility
[01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:12.800]   of hurting somebody in the ring.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.180]   So he gets aroused at the violence.
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:16.620]   - Yeah.
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:19.340]   - I like it 'cause it's coupled to your,
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:22.100]   basically, statement that we need to find
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:27.100]   our own unique way of existing at our top level
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:30.300]   of performance, and that perhaps is Mike Tyson.
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:33.100]   But do you think there's something more deeply universal
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:36.700]   to Mike Tyson speaking to the fact that he's aroused
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:37.540]   at the possibility of violence?
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:38.700]   - Yeah, I do, actually.
[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:41.900]   Although I don't think that it always equates to arousal.
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:45.220]   For people, in fact, I would say in general, it doesn't.
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.460]   I can say I've never had a boner in the ring.
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:50.180]   In fact, if anything, old combat cock is like,
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:51.780]   we're not hanging around, we're leaving.
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:53.780]   We're going up, we're taking off.
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.060]   We don't want anything to do with this.
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:57.860]   You have fun, come back to us when you have something
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.220]   warmer, softer, smells better.
[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:04.900]   But the power, the feeling of aliveness,
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:06.060]   yeah, I could see it.
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:09.380]   Back to even the concept of the Ubermensch,
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:13.320]   I feel like the highest states of being I've ever been in
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.900]   were in the midst of conflict.
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:17.500]   I felt like that was the time,
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:20.020]   those were the moments in my life where I felt like
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:25.020]   I was at the highest level of being as a human in existence.
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.900]   But yet, even being in that state,
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:31.220]   it was not something that you could interact with
[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:33.180]   people that weren't in that state with you.
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:34.720]   They wouldn't get it, you would almost seem.
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.540]   And to be that way all the time,
[01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:38.260]   either A, might drive you mad,
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:42.000]   or B, is you're something that's untenable
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.340]   to the rest of society.
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:45.420]   You can't function with everybody else.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:46.780]   It will not work.
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:48.700]   - It's just like you said with the Ubermensch,
[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:50.740]   it's perhaps that ideal is not something
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:52.180]   you can hold for long.
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:53.620]   That's the very nature of it is.
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:56.700]   - Yeah, well, there was an example in "Thus Spoke Zarathustra"
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:00.860]   about a snake being down the person's throat
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:05.860]   and biting it, and then having this maniacal laughter
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:10.900]   erupting, and to me it was, at least I read it as,
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:16.780]   yeah, okay, there's this insane moment that isn't forever,
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:18.540]   but that it is life and death.
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:23.540]   And the overcoming it is the thing that all of a sudden
[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:27.540]   gives you that tapping into your highest state, right?
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:32.140]   This is, man is a chasm, a tightrope
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:35.740]   between man and Ubermensch.
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:38.420]   Well, I don't wanna leave your thought about,
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:43.580]   we'll call those things flourishes to the aspect
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:48.580]   of Tyson's interpretation or his expression
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:51.060]   of his feelings in combat.
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:53.820]   And so I gave this anecdote to the guy,
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:56.580]   and I just, my first anecdote to that athlete
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:58.220]   I was working with, and I said,
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:01.020]   there isn't a superior way in this sense.
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:02.660]   There is the way that works for you.
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:05.740]   That may be something you can implement to other people
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:07.500]   if you find that person, 'cause we all have
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:11.260]   different personalities, and to me, that's an absolute.
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.580]   I don't wanna, don't come at me
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:16.580]   with all your other fucking social sciences crap.
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:18.660]   No, we have distinct personalities.
[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:21.380]   That personality, who you really are,
[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:25.260]   and this, again, Heidegger, Dasein, being authentic.
[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:28.060]   If you're authentic with who you are, goods and bads,
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:30.100]   you will know how to create what that is.
[01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:33.840]   And for me, violence and fighting and conflict
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.980]   was something that always felt normal to me.
[01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:40.200]   And I don't mean normal in, like I grew up in a war zone
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:42.980]   or an abusive household or something like that.
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:45.620]   I just meant that, and I was a kid who was very
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:49.580]   joyful and inquisitive,
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:54.740]   and spent a lot of time around older people, of all things.
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:58.860]   And also, while I don't think I have much capability
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:02.220]   toward engineering, my mom said that one of the first things
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:04.220]   as like a little baby, when she put me
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:07.680]   in my sister's old crib, instead of my sister
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.020]   who just milled about and was fine with it all,
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:12.060]   the first thing I did was I completely deconstructed it.
[01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:14.480]   I didn't break it, I figured out how to pull it apart.
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:16.480]   - Curiosity about the world, and yet that wasn't
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.600]   in conflict with the idea of violence?
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:19.620]   - No, not at all.
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:23.160]   And so, being a very joyful and nice kid,
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:28.160]   but kids are kids, and if kids can find that you respond
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:34.320]   maybe more easily to agitation, they will agitate you.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:37.200]   And if you should stand out in some way by being taller
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:41.260]   or bigger or something, or caring especially,
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:42.760]   they will agitate you.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.640]   They don't really fully understand it either,
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:47.280]   and so I don't hold anything against any of the kids
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:48.800]   that used to pick on me or whatever,
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.560]   especially at the youngest ages.
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.260]   Man, they don't know shit either.
[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:57.940]   But once that line was pushed, for me it was,
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:02.420]   oh, well, I was being cool, now you're being uncool.
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:04.480]   Well, then that gives me license for everything.
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:06.280]   And so, boom, we would just go at it.
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.200]   Or kids that would try to initiate a fight,
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:13.760]   okay, and being in that moment of just going to town
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:18.760]   with someone else, it just felt like this is--
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:19.760]   - I belong here.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.320]   - Yeah, it was never a problem for me.
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:27.640]   In fact, if anything, what I had to understand was,
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.760]   well, not only did I learn the hard way,
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.920]   that it doesn't matter, at the end of the day,
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:36.080]   it doesn't really matter what anybody else does
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:41.080]   if your response in violence, even to their violence,
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.720]   if you're the winner,
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:45.560]   is often going to be penalized severely.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:51.320]   Society, state apparatus, they don't want any of that.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.480]   They wanna be the only arbiter of violence
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.460]   in the world always.
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:58.200]   But I learned a very difficult lesson with that,
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:01.140]   and it was really impactful in a negative way on me,
[01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:04.480]   but also I had to learn on an individual sense
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:08.120]   to, you need to manage violence too,
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:11.920]   because, hey, if someone attacks you
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:15.160]   or starts a fight with you and you go at it,
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:16.920]   okay, beating 'em up is one thing,
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:21.280]   trying to grab a handful of broken glass from the street
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.380]   and throw it in their face,
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:25.520]   maybe that's a bit much at seven.
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:30.520]   So you need to learn what level is necessary,
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:33.560]   and you need to learn what comes with all,
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:36.600]   what's the responsibility of, when you enact violence,
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:38.160]   I mean, you take on something
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:40.680]   when you have a responsibility for that.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.880]   This is the extension of your actions.
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:48.480]   But as I got older, and especially as I found sports,
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:51.120]   and then combat sports,
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.920]   now this was a place for me to flourish,
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:59.920]   and to the point where I was more myself in that space
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.780]   than I was outside of it until time enough
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:05.960]   where I could learn to get this back together again.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:09.680]   And I never say that I'll merge the two
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.440]   or anything like that, no, all what happened,
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:21.440]   my journey from adolescence on to manhood,
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:24.240]   a huge portion of it,
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:27.240]   besides the normal finding yourself, whatever, whatever,
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:32.240]   actually what it was was getting back to who I always was.
[01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:35.180]   - That curious kid, the kind kid.
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:36.540]   - Getting back to the guy
[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:38.940]   that I should have been allowed to become
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:43.940]   instead of what happened under the pressures of other things.
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:49.500]   And the attempt for society and certain people
[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:55.580]   within a managerial positions to compress what that was
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:58.100]   into something that they found more suitable.
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:26:59.300]   - Yeah, but those pressures allow you
[01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:02.320]   to discover this little world, forbidden world,
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.640]   in many ways, of violence that you could explore.
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:07.440]   Through sport, you can explore it,
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:11.440]   and it's more socially acceptable to explore it through sport.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.120]   - For sure, but even then,
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.560]   at times, it's socially unacceptable.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:21.560]   So I beat Sem Schilt, he cut my right eyebrow,
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:25.760]   I cut him and busted his nose,
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:28.800]   and he's bleeding all over me as I have an armbar on top,
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:33.460]   and it's raining blood, quote some slayer,
[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:37.540]   from a lacerated Sem Schilt, bleeding in his horror,
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:39.620]   creating my structures, now I shall rain in blood.
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:44.620]   But I win the fight, armbar, nasty one,
[01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:48.860]   I get on my feet, and the first thing I do
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:52.220]   is I wipe all the blood off onto my hands,
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:55.600]   and I lick it, and I do my thing.
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:59.420]   And all the MMA journalists freaked out.
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:01.660]   Dana Wise, like, "Man, I don't know about that.
[01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:04.940]   "We don't want him doing, everybody had this huge problem."
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:07.740]   And then some folks would even contend,
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:11.100]   oh, you're trying to do, like, no, no, no,
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:13.820]   this isn't planned, I don't think of these things,
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:16.900]   this is how I really feel, this is who I really am.
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:21.900]   And it was even kind of comical after the fact,
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:24.220]   BJ Penn was on the very card with me,
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:26.080]   watching him at some point in his career
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.800]   all of a sudden win fights,
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.800]   and then do this licking the glove thing,
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.280]   and everyone thinks it's the coolest thing ever,
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.280]   and I'm like, "Hey, fuckfaces, I did this in 2002,
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:40.000]   "or one, 2001, and BJ Penn actually back then
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.560]   "was like, dude, you're a badass, you're a killer."
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:45.080]   - Where did that come from?
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.000]   Because that seems like a deeply human moment.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.840]   - I could say, I could just be goofy about it
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:52.320]   and call it orgiastic, to align with--
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.720]   - Are we back to Mike Tyson?
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:58.000]   - Yeah, Tyson, but no, no, it's beyond that.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.080]   - Is it a celebration of human nature?
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.680]   - I've had some pretty decent orgasms
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.640]   in my life at this point, I'm 43,
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.360]   but no, none have ever compared to that.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:09.400]   Like I said, it is a feeling of highest being to me.
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.420]   - That's your Ubermensch moment.
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:15.680]   - This is where I feel like the restrictions
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:20.200]   of general existence in society are gone,
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:23.800]   and I get to fully live in a state
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:26.840]   that feels more meaningful, of the most meaning.
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.440]   I think of it as life and death.
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:36.080]   It is the way I'm built, and I've never had any problem
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.040]   applying violence.
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.760]   Like it doesn't, I don't know where it comes from
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.240]   or how you would define it or whatever,
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:44.640]   if you wanna stick me in a psychologist chair,
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:48.440]   but there's a part of me that can just,
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:50.600]   no, if I'm gonna apply, I can apply violence
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.880]   to any level and be okay with it.
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.920]   And it doesn't, I don't lose sleep,
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:57.900]   it doesn't bother me, it's not a problem.
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:02.900]   It was me learning how to fully understand violence,
[01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:07.440]   humans, and the broader perspective
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:09.040]   that allowed me to think about things
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:12.820]   and like, well, what do I really wanna accomplish
[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:15.720]   with my actions in the world just on a whole?
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:18.920]   Not compartmentalizing my sporting career.
[01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:23.920]   Even when I get in the ring, I don't have any mercy,
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:26.000]   generally, and if I do, it's because I make
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   a really deliberate attempt to be in a state
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.440]   where I can have mercy.
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.680]   If I just go in there to fight with everything I got,
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:38.200]   there is zero-- - The natural state of violence.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:40.120]   - There's nothing that will hold me back
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:43.120]   other than the referee, and that's that.
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:46.760]   I know I agreed to be allowed to do and not to do,
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:51.760]   but within that, no, and I expect it to be done to me.
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:56.320]   - But in terms of values, in terms of seeing what,
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:01.320]   to me, violence is just yet another canvas
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:04.880]   that humans can paint beautifully on.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:07.740]   - Clearly, I mean, we have venerated the violent.
[01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:11.840]   There are communists that venerate the violent
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:12.920]   on their behalf.
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.460]   There are national socialists
[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:16.240]   that venerate the violent there,
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:19.240]   and then if you remove it from an ideological perspective,
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:23.680]   we venerate the violent when they're a hero.
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:26.960]   We venerate the violent in our religion.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:29.240]   Well, I mean, I guess some people venerate the violence
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:32.360]   of Yahweh and Sodom and Gomorrah, right?
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.720]   So, or do we say Jehovah?
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:35.560]   I don't know.
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:38.960]   - Is there, you've already mentioned one,
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:42.560]   but is there a fight where you've achieved
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:46.200]   the highest of heights for your own personal being,
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:48.480]   just when you look within yourself
[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.880]   that you're the proudest of,
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:51.940]   or maybe was your most beautiful creation?
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:52.780]   Is there something that stands out?
[01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:54.920]   - Yeah, there are a few, actually.
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:57.080]   Fighting semi-shield and a rematch.
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:58.880]   Well, the first one was pretty good, too,
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:01.660]   but the rematch was I was suffering,
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:06.660]   I had suffered prior, the week prior to food poisoning,
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:09.880]   and so while my abs were looking all right,
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:16.120]   I, in the ring, didn't have the power that I expected to,
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:19.640]   and I was struggling in ways,
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:22.800]   in some of the grappling, with the submission stuff,
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.240]   that I hadn't accounted for.
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.760]   - Just exhaustion or mental exhaustion?
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.680]   - No, I mean, like, just physical,
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:32.120]   I wasn't back up to 100% in terms of just power output,
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:36.800]   and semi was, well, he's always seven foot tall,
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.640]   but this time he was, the first time I fought him,
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:43.640]   he was 260, or 257, or 260 something, something like that.
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:46.800]   This time, he was like 290,
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:49.000]   and so he was a significantly bigger cat,
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.000]   and he's a big dude, and I just remember being
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.980]   up against the ropes with him,
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:00.320]   changing levels, trying to take him down,
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.800]   and he's fighting, he's hipping,
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.600]   and I just thought in my head,
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:05.360]   there's no fucking way I'm gonna lose this fight.
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:07.200]   There's no way, you are not going to beat me,
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:11.120]   it's not gonna happen, and I armbarred him, the other arm.
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.560]   You remember the fact, he's like,
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:13.880]   man, I really wanted to get you for that,
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:15.040]   I wanted to get that match back,
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.760]   and then you fucking got my other arm, dick.
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:20.200]   I'm like, eh, dude, I still love you, though.
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:22.240]   - But the whole time, you're like,
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.800]   so this has to do with the dichotomy
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:27.120]   of you feeling your worst.
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.400]   - And having to overcome and make it.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.320]   - You're literally mentally telling yourself,
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.160]   there's no way.
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:32.800]   - There's no fucking way I'm gonna lose this fight,
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:35.440]   and then there's even my last bare knuckle match,
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:36.920]   and getting in the ring and fighting
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:40.520]   bare knuckle boxing for the first time,
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:45.520]   and just thinking, just being in a great state,
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:48.840]   and just looking so forward to seeing,
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:52.160]   I mean, I called someone, I was talking to them
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:54.260]   the night before, and I said, yeah, well,
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:57.440]   I video called you 'cause this face
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:00.000]   might not look like this when I see you next,
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.200]   and they're just like, ooh, okay.
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:05.040]   - So it's not just empty trash talk.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:05.880]   - No.
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:08.720]   - That's a clarity of mind and a seriousness
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:09.560]   about this particular battle.
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:12.960]   - I might die, pretty high chance
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:16.040]   of being deformed some way, so, well, fuck it.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:16.960]   I don't really care.
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:18.640]   - Do you think about, are you accepting
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:20.320]   your own death that you're going through?
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.160]   - Yes, 100%.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:24.120]   In fact, and that's, in a strange way,
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:26.360]   that's partially what makes it so elevated
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:29.160]   in terms of my sense of feeling,
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:34.160]   by being able to have death at my side, it feels good.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:42.000]   And to be there and to think that this could be the one,
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.800]   like, why not?
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:46.160]   I'm not a religious person at all,
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:48.520]   even though I very much have to,
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.840]   seems to bang on the drum about the usefulness
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:53.600]   or understanding the usefulness of religion for people.
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:58.840]   But if I gotta do something, then yeah,
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:34:59.880]   put me in Valhalla, man.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.000]   I don't wanna be anywhere else.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.840]   Nothing else seems like a good place for me to be.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:06.240]   I wanna fight all day long and feast all night.
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.760]   You know, it sounds great.
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:11.280]   - I saw you throw your hat into the ring of Vader,
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.120]   I mean, I mean, I think.
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:13.320]   - Yes.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:14.480]   He got COVID, I guess.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:17.760]   I hope he overcomes it and comes out just as good,
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:18.600]   if not better.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:19.440]   - Epic with that.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:22.000]   Did I understand correctly that that might be his last fight?
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.160]   - Yes, that's my understanding.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:25.440]   And it would be epic as hell.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:26.640]   And it would be epic as hell
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:31.240]   because the person that I wanna give my most to
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:33.040]   is a person that I respect,
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:38.040]   especially at this long career of mine
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.480]   and getting at this--
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:41.040]   - And his as well. - Twilight years.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.360]   - It's like two warriors.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:45.320]   - And that's the thing about even this going in there
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.920]   with the aspect of being with death and all that
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:51.080]   is that when that person is in there,
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.960]   they are my brother with me in this.
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:55.160]   And that so when you give me your best,
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:58.240]   even if I win dominant fashion,
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.560]   but if you show up and you're as authentic
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:03.040]   and being here as I am, then I love you.
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.360]   And I'm glad for you to be here and we're in this together.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.360]   And at this point, your loss or my loss or whatever
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:14.600]   is no less deserving of veneration than the win.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:15.920]   Like we're here in this.
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.080]   And so to be in the ring with Fyodor
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:21.400]   and to venerate him in win or defeat,
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:26.400]   to be in there with someone like that is to me,
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.480]   it's so rare.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:33.240]   - It's incredible how the ultimate violence
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:37.800]   is coupled with like love or respect.
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:40.200]   And it's like, it's weird how this is,
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:45.400]   how the competition in its violent form
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:50.400]   is also a veneration of just human connection.
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:52.360]   - It's also the removal.
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:55.640]   I feel like it's the purest, one of the purest ways,
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:59.160]   purest, most honest places a person can exist.
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:01.280]   That line in Fight Club, you don't know really who you are
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.120]   until you've been in a fight.
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:03.560]   I mean, believe that.
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:06.480]   And I've seen so many examples of people
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:09.500]   trying to portray themselves as one thing.
[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:12.880]   And then in the ring, you see who they really are.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:15.200]   Or even when they're trying to portray themselves
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.080]   as one thing and they're winning,
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:21.280]   the crowd at times will see who they really are
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:22.280]   and still hate them.
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:25.760]   It's like, but I said all the good things.
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.760]   Bro, don't work that way.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.480]   - Yeah, but speaking of fado,
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:31.480]   if we take you out of the picture,
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:33.720]   who are the greatest mixed martial arts fighters
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:34.560]   of all time?
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.760]   - I feel--
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:38.280]   - You out of the picture.
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.680]   - As a cop out to some degree,
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:42.760]   I feel like we need a little bit more time
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:47.360]   to see how this unfolds.
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:48.840]   Because you gotta compare a lot of things.
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:52.440]   And I, did I, I think I'm--
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:53.280]   - Like centuries?
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:54.120]   - I did an interview.
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:55.120]   I don't know about centuries,
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:57.240]   but that would help if we can keep accurate records
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:01.660]   and not allow too much bias to fall in,
[01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:02.500]   too much propaganda.
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:03.320]   - The victor still, right?
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:04.160]   - Yeah, good luck, yeah.
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:08.040]   But I made an argument.
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:14.240]   I did a, it was a interview with an MMA outlet of some sort.
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:16.360]   And I can't recall who it was.
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:18.880]   But oh, it was an argument about,
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:23.880]   will the winner of Cain Velasquez versus Stipe Miocik
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.560]   be the greatest MMA heavyweight of all time?
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:29.200]   And I said, fucking no way.
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:31.080]   Oh no, it's Cormier and Miocik.
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:32.040]   That's what it was.
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:35.200]   I said, absolutely not, not even close.
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:37.400]   And I said, these guys need a bit more time
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.360]   to see how things go.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:41.200]   And also how things go for some of their opponents.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:43.640]   And there's more factors than just this one fight.
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:44.480]   It really is.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:47.720]   And I go, and when you wanna weigh these people,
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:50.120]   even if let's say, we'll bring Alistair,
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:52.840]   yeah, Alistair Overeem into the equation.
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:56.120]   Okay, you judge him on what you know now,
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.480]   what he's done for you lately, okay?
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:59.380]   - Right.
[01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:01.940]   - Which is a very myopic way of doing it.
[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:04.600]   What has he done over his career?
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.480]   K1 champion.
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:10.560]   He was a champion in Dream.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:13.960]   He striked for us, blah, blah, blah.
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:15.680]   His overall record.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:18.200]   The entirety of all the different opponents he's fought.
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:20.360]   And I just sit back and I go,
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:22.640]   okay, he's not the UFC champ,
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:27.360]   but his accolades, his merits,
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:32.980]   in some ways, actually stand up higher
[01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:35.560]   than Cormier's and Miocik's.
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:37.160]   - So what about the moments,
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:41.640]   do you give much value to the special moments,
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.560]   like the highest heights you rise to?
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:46.560]   Not in terms of records or the strikes landed,
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.320]   but just creating a magical moment in a fight.
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:52.340]   It doesn't have to be even a championship fight,
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:54.760]   but just, you know, Conor McGregor
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:57.080]   is an example of somebody who creates a narrative,
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:59.160]   who creates a story, who creates a drama,
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.720]   and a special magic happens,
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:02.400]   even if it's like not with a--
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:04.400]   - Myth is greater than reality,
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:05.560]   and that is always the case.
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:06.400]   - But do you--
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.240]   - And so I understand that so very much,
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:13.200]   and it takes an asshole like me to poo-poo on your myth.
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:15.000]   At least get you, at the end of the day,
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.520]   you're not gonna abandon your myth,
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:21.520]   but perhaps temper it with the facts and logic.
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:24.120]   - So you're not a fan of myth?
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:26.540]   - No, I'm an absolute massive fan of myth.
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:28.080]   - But you prefer facts and logic.
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:29.760]   - It's like when I, no, I mean,
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.400]   I like saying facts and logic,
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:34.480]   because people, I also,
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:36.240]   I am not a materialist in that sense.
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:38.720]   I don't think that materialism can solve for everything.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:40.800]   It's not enough, it's not robust enough.
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.720]   I'm sorry, if facts and logic,
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:46.560]   or reason, as the Enlightenment scholars all thought,
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:49.760]   including Marx, was enough for people,
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:53.360]   then we wouldn't have any religions.
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.400]   We wouldn't have, there would be no,
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:56.800]   we wouldn't have narratives and myths
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.100]   and all this kind of stuff.
[01:40:58.100 --> 01:40:59.640]   It would not, it just, I'm sorry,
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:02.400]   there is no, there is nothing about history
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:07.400]   that supports the idea that rationality will overcome all.
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:09.360]   - There's something about Ben Shapiro's
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:10.880]   facts don't care about your feelings
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:14.880]   that feels to be, feels to be missing
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.600]   something fundamental about human nature.
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:20.200]   It's not clear to me exactly what is missing.
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:24.720]   - To give old Ben a fair shake,
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:27.240]   and I don't know Ben Shapiro.
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:29.000]   I don't really listen to Ben Shapiro,
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.720]   not against Ben Shapiro.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:35.800]   I'm not here to say anything particularly bad about him.
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.160]   Although I will say at one time,
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.680]   Tom Arnold was seemingly trying to pick
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:42.160]   an actionable fight with Ben Shapiro.
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:43.000]   - In the ring.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.600]   - Somewhere, yeah.
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:46.920]   And I just, and I actually responded,
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:48.200]   and I tried to get him to clarify,
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:51.760]   say hey, are you saying that you wanna fight Ben Shapiro,
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:52.920]   that you're looking to actually,
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.480]   'cause I was waiting for him to say something,
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:56.020]   and then I can be like, okay, well,
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:58.120]   it's one thing to wanna get into a fight with someone.
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:03.120]   It's another thing to go pick on a little tiny guy like Ben
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:05.760]   who's much smaller than you and doesn't train or whatever,
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:08.360]   but if it's not me, I can find someone your size,
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:09.720]   and you can go fight him.
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:13.320]   Basically, don't be a bully piece of shit.
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:17.480]   Which, by the way, Tom Arnold, you are a mental midget.
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:20.220]   You are never going to be able to compete
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:22.040]   even with Ben Shapiro in an argument
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:23.920]   on any level about anything.
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:24.960]   - Oh, intellectual argument.
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:26.640]   - Yeah, intellectual argument.
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:29.840]   Maybe you can scream louder than him, but whatever.
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:34.240]   - But nevertheless, in the discussion of greatness
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:36.840]   in fighting, are numbers. - I think you need to look
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:39.120]   at some of the, you need to look at some of the numbers.
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:40.280]   - And there's the magic.
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:42.920]   - There is some context also in that,
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:45.200]   where did Alistair Overeem fight?
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:47.400]   Oh, he fought in Pride, where you could soccer kick people
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:48.840]   and stomp their head and this and that,
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:53.360]   and so the game environment is actually different too.
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:55.700]   - There's more uncertainty, there's more chaos in Pride,
[01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:58.160]   there's more-- - Go back a little further
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:00.560]   and go like, what about the guys that used to fight,
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:04.480]   Dan Severn fought bare knuckle, head butts, the whole nine.
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.560]   - You beat Dan Severn, right?
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:08.200]   - I did beat Dan Severn, that was killing an idol,
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.260]   so to speak, although I didn't really kill him
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:12.080]   because I still love him.
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:15.720]   I mean, he's still responsible for inspiration
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:17.400]   along this whole pathway.
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:21.400]   It's meeting your God and then putting a knife in it,
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:24.560]   I guess. (laughing)
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:26.800]   - Realizing they're human and then bringing them
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.640]   down to your level.
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:31.400]   - Exactly, but also there's a huge misconception there
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:33.080]   and that is that I could bring,
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:35.840]   maybe I could bring Dan Severn down to my level,
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:38.720]   but I couldn't bring his mustache down to my level.
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:41.200]   It is of mythic proportions and--
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:42.880]   - Greater than yours.
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.600]   Your facial hair is greater than yours.
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:47.960]   - My facial hair is creating its own legacy,
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:50.360]   but it is not Dan Severn mustache level
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:53.900]   or now Don Fry mustache, so Don Fry mustache,
[01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:57.040]   Dan Severn mustache, now you have like
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:59.000]   Shia versus Sunni, like that's--
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.960]   (laughing)
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:04.320]   - You think there'll be Karl Marx painting
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.440]   of Josh Barnett one day with the beard?
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.280]   And is that basically what you're trying to--
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:11.520]   - I hope so, I will actually comb my hair, unlike Marx.
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:12.360]   But--
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:16.440]   - Chaos has a charm to it.
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:17.400]   - It does, it does.
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:20.400]   I mean, we all thought Doc Brown in Back to the Future
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:22.240]   was quite charming.
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:23.760]   - You have to throw that into the calculation
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:24.800]   where they fought.
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:25.640]   - Yes. - I mean, this is the--
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:27.080]   - And the rules that they fought under,
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:28.880]   you know, some guy like Igor Volfeynchen
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:33.260]   won a 32-man tournament or something like that.
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:34.280]   I go, okay,
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:39.480]   Stipe and Daniel Cormier are awesome.
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:44.040]   And they will, for sure, be revered
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:48.600]   for their careers, 100%.
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:51.960]   Can you say that they're particularly even better
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:54.000]   overall than Igor Volfeynchen?
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.800]   Well, maybe one of them could've beat them,
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:57.640]   maybe one of them wouldn't have.
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:59.680]   Maybe Igor would've fuckin' got 'em
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:01.080]   with the knuckles right away.
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:02.440]   Well, maybe if they fought 'em in pride,
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:03.280]   they wouldn't have won.
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:05.760]   Maybe if they fought 'em bare-knuckle, they wouldn't have won.
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:06.600]   I don't know.
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:07.760]   - And there's something about the chaos,
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:11.040]   like do you put Hoyse Gracie in the top 10?
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:12.280]   You know, there's something about--
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:17.280]   - Top 10 of all time in terms of competitors?
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:19.040]   Capable?
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:21.120]   I don't know, I'd have to think about that, maybe not.
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:24.520]   But I put Hoyse Gracie as like pyramid level,
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:28.600]   like wow, dude, what an amazing man.
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:32.000]   Yeah, he's so important, absolutely incredibly important.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.200]   - But there's something about stepping into,
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.760]   like fighting another human being
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:40.640]   under all the uncertainty that the early UFCs had.
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:43.520]   I mean, you don't know what is going to happen.
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:46.540]   And couple that with not much money.
[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:48.480]   All of it.
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:49.320]   - Yes.
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:50.440]   - So the purity of it, too.
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:51.640]   There's something about money,
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:54.040]   I mean, that gets the shit for that in the capitalist world,
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:57.200]   but that ruins the purity of the violence.
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:00.720]   - Yeah, people, given the opportunity for,
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:04.720]   yeah, the bigger things get, the more,
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:07.280]   I love the fact that fighting has opened up
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:12.280]   to such a degree that the career business side of it,
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:16.400]   'cause I absolutely distinctly separate the two,
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:18.580]   the business side of it has opened up
[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:20.260]   to give me far more possibilities,
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:23.060]   opened way more doors for me than I ever intended it to.
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:29.840]   Whereas the athlete side of things has,
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:33.680]   if anything, just gotten substantially worse, I would say.
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:38.680]   And some of this can be, some of this is due to all,
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:43.280]   the nature of all games will be learned,
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:47.800]   will be gamed without even the rules being broken.
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:49.300]   And once that's figured out,
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:51.240]   you need to make an adjustment.
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:53.680]   No adjustments have been made.
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:56.480]   So the game just appears to be the same game
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:59.520]   over and over and over and over and over again,
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:02.720]   on ESPN+, on whatever, on whatever, on whatever.
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:04.680]   It doesn't really matter which night you watch,
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:06.880]   it's the same game constantly.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:11.880]   And that's not because the athletes are worse or better,
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:16.460]   it's because they have had that game structure long enough
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:18.120]   that they figured out,
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:21.240]   what do you do to be the most successful at it?
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:23.280]   What is the highest percentage way of approaching it,
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:26.220]   essentially, even if you're not thinking of percentages?
[01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:29.000]   - What were the, if we take a step back,
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.860]   it's really fascinating to think about the early UFCs.
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:33.640]   Did you fight Dan Saverin in the UFC?
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:35.240]   - I fought him in Super Brawl.
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:37.180]   - Super Brawl, so that was in the early, early days,
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:38.580]   you're undefeated. - 2000.
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:43.480]   - What were those early days, let's say,
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:45.320]   of mixed martial arts like?
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:46.560]   Did you have--
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:49.180]   - Let me tell you the day of high adventure.
[01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:50.880]   (laughing)
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.600]   Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:56.680]   Yeah, it is, it was so much fun.
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:00.160]   And it made you feel absolutely like you were a part of
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:04.480]   a novel, a comic book.
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:08.880]   I mean, I would love to transcribe my experiences
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:11.720]   as what I consider a second generation MMA athlete,
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.000]   except I'm way too sensitive to anybody's personal,
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:25.360]   any things that are, not even to,
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:26.640]   I'm not a gospy person.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:29.920]   I really do believe that small people talk about others.
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:31.660]   Big people talk about ideas.
[01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:36.960]   But there's just some stories that you can't tell
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:38.240]   without telling the whole story.
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:42.120]   And there are so many amazing stories
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:43.400]   that could be told.
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:45.800]   - People being at their best, people being at their worst.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:47.600]   - Yeah, the whole, the whole--
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:50.400]   - Is there something you could speak to
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:51.800]   the chaos of the time?
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:55.840]   - Oh, 100%, like, well, okay, so we at AMC got
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:58.640]   connected to somebody that was throwing an event
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:02.240]   in Nampa, Idaho, and we all piled into this
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:07.160]   and Matt Humes, Subaru wagon, and we jammed out.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:10.900]   And we left Kirkland and we headed over to Idaho,
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:15.900]   only to find out that there was nothing
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:17.640]   really put in place.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:22.640]   It was absolute disrepair and chaos.
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:25.080]   They didn't have a ring, they didn't have this.
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:28.520]   It was such a bullshit adventure.
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:32.220]   But we were like, well, you know,
[01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:34.600]   there's hardly anywhere to fight.
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:36.280]   It's tough to find these opportunities.
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:39.400]   So, okay, well, how about this?
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:42.920]   Whoever is here to fight and is willing,
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:45.300]   all right, well, since there's no venue,
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:47.600]   there's no this, whatever, we all got gloves,
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:50.080]   we got mouthpieces, we'll just go to the park
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:51.600]   as long as they'll get paid.
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:54.760]   And so, folks were kind of like,
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:56.200]   I don't know about that.
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:59.680]   The guy I was gonna fight was, he finally figured,
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:03.000]   he finally gets information on who I actually am.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.520]   And I was undefeated at the time.
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:09.320]   I think I had fought Super Bowl XIII
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.440]   and already won that tournament.
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:13.960]   And so, he's like, yeah, I had no clue.
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.100]   I'm so glad we didn't fight.
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:16.120]   You would have murdered me.
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:18.480]   This is, you know, what a setup.
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:21.720]   And eventually, Matt had to strong arm the guy
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:24.080]   and get our money that we were supposed to all get
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:25.560]   and drive back.
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:27.320]   And 'cause his whole position was,
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:28.440]   well, there ain't no fucking way.
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:31.540]   We drove all the way out here for free.
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:32.920]   This is on you.
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:35.440]   You fucked this up, not my problem.
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:38.360]   But what is my problem is the lack of cash in my account.
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:40.180]   So, fix it.
[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:45.180]   You know, or me fighting my first organized fight
[01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:50.400]   against an AMC guy on 11 days notice
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:54.540]   through a connection to an old wrestling coach I had.
[01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:58.120]   And I just gathered up with all my old martial arts,
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:00.560]   my old martial arts instructor that I had worked with.
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:05.560]   And we grappled in his apartment.
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:08.560]   We did tie pads in the park.
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.200]   I ran a couple miles every day.
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:13.240]   And then, all right, boom, show it up.
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:15.720]   Won my fight by front choke in two minutes.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:20.320]   And then Matt goes, okay, well, hey, you did really great.
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:22.280]   We'd like you to come back and fight again in the summer.
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:23.440]   What do you think?
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:26.060]   Okay, go back off to university.
[01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:29.480]   And then I think, hmm, well, that fight didn't go exactly
[01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:30.960]   how I wanted it to.
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:34.640]   So, I gotta find a way to get more experience.
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:38.280]   I would literally fight people in the university
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:41.720]   like rec center on the old wrestling mats
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:43.280]   as they didn't all have a wrestling team.
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:45.280]   I would find anyone doing martial arts,
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:47.280]   anyone talking about getting into street fights,
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:49.280]   anyone, whatever, and just basically go,
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:51.300]   oh, you ever watch UFC?
[01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:52.560]   Yeah, yeah, that stuff's cool.
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:53.400]   What do you think?
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:54.560]   Oh, man, I'm super into it, man.
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:55.920]   It's badass.
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:56.760]   Rad.
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:00.040]   So, would you wanna fight?
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:01.920]   (laughing)
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:04.000]   I mean, it was way easier picking fights
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.360]   than it was getting a girlfriend.
[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:10.200]   So, I just, you know, path leads to resistance.
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:11.960]   - I think it might be useful for us
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:14.360]   to get some advice from you.
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:15.200]   - Yeah, all right.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:18.560]   - 'Cause you've accomplished for the journey
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:21.120]   of a martial artist first.
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:24.000]   If you've accomplished some of the greatest accolades
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:24.960]   there is in the sport,
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:27.280]   if somebody who's starting out now
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:29.000]   or early on in their journey,
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.920]   what advice would you give on how to become
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:37.480]   a martial artist, a catch wrestler, a fighter?
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:41.840]   - Well, I mean, really what it comes down to
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:43.520]   is do it because you love it.
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:46.240]   Do it for that reason and that reason alone.
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:49.440]   Most people that get into this
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:51.640]   and attempt to make any sort of
[01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:53.320]   professional inroads with it,
[01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:55.560]   you are not going to be the world champion.
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:59.200]   You probably will never even fight for a belt.
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:03.340]   You're probably not going to net make money at this.
[01:53:03.340 --> 01:53:06.200]   So, don't do it for those reasons.
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:08.280]   Do it for the reason of the passion.
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:10.360]   Do it for the reason to be the absolute best
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:13.120]   that you can be, whatever that ends up being.
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:17.000]   You might, at best, only be mediocre.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.240]   But you won't even be mediocre
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:20.360]   if you don't do it like you really mean it.
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:21.880]   So-- - The passion look,
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:25.120]   where's the kernel of the passion, would you say?
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:27.720]   Is it in the learning process itself, the improvement?
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:29.560]   - I think it really depends on the person, right?
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:31.200]   I mean, there's some people that really love
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:36.200]   the fact of they feel like they're growing, right?
[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:37.960]   Will to power, you're growing,
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:39.600]   growing stronger, growing better.
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:44.700]   The idea of eliminating weakness.
[01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:48.720]   So, to which I'll quickly define weakness
[01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:51.280]   as just like things that weaken you,
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:53.680]   not like being physically weak.
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:55.320]   Sure, you could call that weakness,
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:57.720]   but maybe you're not meant to be a super strong guy.
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:54:02.420]   But choosing to be weak is really a different story
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:06.040]   other than just like we're all deficient
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:07.380]   in some way or another.
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:10.440]   So, that's neither here nor there.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:12.160]   It's a matter of what you decide to do with it.
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:13.680]   And that's an information strength and weakness,
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:14.840]   at least the way I look at it.
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:16.480]   Like strength is choosing,
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:19.760]   regardless of the difficulty, to make improvements.
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:21.520]   Strength is even choosing to acknowledge
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:25.160]   that you do lack and accept it
[01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:27.520]   and then make a decision on what to do with it.
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:30.840]   - Yeah, but there's also, there's a bunch of stuff
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:32.620]   that just like you said, it's what you're drawn to.
[01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:35.000]   There's an honesty to just grappling
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.320]   that it seems more real than anything else you can do.
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:39.840]   - Sure, well, and also--
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:41.200]   - That's where the passion and love can come from.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:43.420]   - Yeah, I mean, it's being in an environment,
[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:46.040]   hopefully, that is as true as possible,
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:47.720]   would be a starter.
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:52.400]   So, it's hard to be a bullshit person
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:55.520]   when you're literally trying to tear each other's arms off.
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:56.360]   - Yeah.
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:58.840]   - You really sort of see who somebody is.
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:01.480]   I also feel like you really get to see somebody who,
[01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:03.140]   there are a couple instances where you really see
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:07.040]   who people are on the mats and in the bedroom.
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:12.040]   So, even the aspect of self-betterment,
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:19.520]   growth along a path, I mean, hell,
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:23.720]   that's part of the device of capture
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:26.440]   for martial arts as a business.
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:29.040]   Give you a belt, put a stripe on your belt.
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:31.960]   Each of these iterations cost 20 bucks.
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:35.440]   - But there's a benefit to that, too.
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:38.240]   I really enjoyed the progression of belts.
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:39.080]   - Sure.
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:41.400]   - 'Cause a bit of it is OCD or whatever,
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:44.300]   but you're enjoying the recognition of your growth
[01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:46.480]   when you feel, when you're made to feel,
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:48.880]   when I think genuinely you do earn it.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.320]   - Yeah, I agree. - In that process.
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:51.160]   - I agree.
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:52.960]   It makes complete sense to me.
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:57.600]   It just, anything that has a goodness in its purity
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:00.680]   can also have a detriment in its perversion.
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:04.360]   - And there's a value to competition.
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:06.360]   I've gotten some shit in the past for saying this.
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:11.360]   I've gotten the most value in giving everything I have
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:15.940]   to try to win and lose.
[01:56:15.940 --> 01:56:19.760]   So I've gotten, I remember most of the matches I've lost,
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:23.580]   and I think that's what I've gotten the most
[01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:25.160]   from the sport is losing.
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:26.000]   - Think about it.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.640]   I mean, if you really think about it,
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:34.080]   what makes you wanna actually, in detail,
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:36.940]   go over what happened?
[01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:39.320]   Oh, it's the time when you didn't get what you wanted.
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:41.580]   It's a time when you gave it everything you had
[01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:45.120]   and you came up short or failed miserably.
[01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:47.820]   - Especially if you're embarrassed in some way.
[01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:50.300]   - Right, and so that's usually the only time people,
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:53.000]   again, calamity, is the impetus for them
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.700]   to actually turn around and go,
[01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:55.740]   "Who the fuck am I?
[01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:57.780]   "What am I doing and why am I doing it?"
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:02.320]   Instead of naturally going, "Hmm, okay, well, I won.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:03.240]   "Why?
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:04.080]   "What was it that caused it?"
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:06.940]   And so I think part of my success is that
[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:09.820]   when I win, I'm brutal.
[01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:11.900]   When I lose, I'm brutal.
[01:57:11.900 --> 01:57:13.760]   And there is no in-between.
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:18.760]   So I remember losing the rematch against Noguera,
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:24.340]   and I still feel like it was a bullshit call.
[01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:28.420]   I feel like I won that fight, but my opinion is that,
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:31.740]   and this even came up, so one of the coaches in the back
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:34.080]   was like, "Oh, you did great.
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.900]   "Don't feel bad, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:36.800]   And I go, "No, fuck that.
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:37.920]   "I didn't finish him.
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:40.360]   "I allowed the referees to make a decision
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:42.300]   "that I think is incorrect and bad,
[01:57:42.300 --> 01:57:44.860]   "but that came because I didn't take him out.
[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:46.480]   "Fuck that, no, no.
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:48.280]   "He won, he's gonna get more money,
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:49.600]   "he's gonna get more recognition,
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:50.980]   "blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:53.400]   "I accept all this, and it's not okay.
[01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:57.080]   "And I need to, when I get a chance to fight him again,
[01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:00.240]   "I gotta figure out how to take this guy out,
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:01.440]   "I don't wanna say forever.
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:02.940]   "I'm not trying to put him six feet underground.
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:04.620]   "Well, when I fight, yes I am."
[01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:09.020]   But the point being, I need to find a way to,
[01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:12.640]   this is definitive, you don't get to say shit about it,
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:15.080]   'cause I'm the only one who can stand right now.
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:16.480]   That's the way it's gotta be.
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:19.740]   Anything less than that is not good enough.
[01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:22.880]   And even if I achieve that, then I gotta figure out,
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:25.300]   okay, it's not a given.
[01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:26.580]   How did I get to this point?
[01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:28.780]   How did I make that happen?
[01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:32.680]   Was it simply because of his own mistakes,
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:36.960]   or was it because of my successful action?
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:38.680]   - So it was always self-critical.
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:40.440]   - Always, constantly.
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:42.480]   - You love movies.
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:43.960]   I read this somewhere.
[01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:45.640]   You mentioned "Blade Runner" as a favorite.
[01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:48.680]   - Number one of all time, the final cut, that's my go-to.
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:51.520]   - So you would say "Blade Runner"
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:52.760]   is the greatest movie of all time.
[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:54.800]   - It's one of the greatest movies of all time.
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:56.800]   - What's in the top?
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:01.360]   - My top five, "Blade Runner," final cut.
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:03.160]   - This is the original "Blade Runner."
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:06.880]   - And I used to own, on tape, the original--
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:08.380]   - VHS? - Cut, yeah.
[01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:11.820]   And I had the director's cut on DVD.
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:13.460]   - Why "Blade Runner," by the way?
[01:59:13.460 --> 01:59:15.580]   What connects you to it? - As a kid,
[01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:17.140]   I just thought it was so cool.
[01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:18.620]   There was something about it that really spoke to me,
[01:59:18.620 --> 01:59:20.180]   the whole cyberpunk landscapes,
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:25.180]   and this guy chasing down rogue androids, replicants,
[01:59:25.180 --> 01:59:27.860]   and all this.
[01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:31.220]   - Is it just the entire cyberpunk universe,
[01:59:31.220 --> 01:59:32.980]   or is it just robots as well?
[01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:36.980]   - No, it's, I mean, the cyberpunk universe is part of it.
[01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:39.540]   On the surface, I've always tended
[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:42.460]   towards dark subject matter,
[01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:45.540]   like things that are of the dark, so to speak,
[01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:48.540]   are things that I've always been gravitated towards.
[01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:51.580]   I think maybe part of it is that the things that are darker
[01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:56.580]   are more accepting and more upfront with death.
[01:59:56.580 --> 02:00:02.980]   And perhaps I think that maybe that is what was--
[02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:04.500]   - Yeah, somehow more honest, perhaps.
[02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:08.780]   There's also the aspect of rebelliousness, usually.
[02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:13.780]   Like there is, I was never one to wanna just do
[02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:16.100]   what somebody told me to do.
[02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:22.420]   I'm not sitting around trying to always be
[02:00:22.420 --> 02:00:25.380]   such a radical individual that I can't take orders.
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:28.420]   No, in fact, I'm more than willing to take orders
[02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:32.860]   from somebody that I feel is competent and has merit
[02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:34.660]   and reason behind what they're doing
[02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:36.260]   and makes like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:37.340]   I'm 100% for it.
[02:00:37.340 --> 02:00:38.700]   Not only will I kinda take orders,
[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:40.620]   I will help you achieve whatever it is
[02:00:40.620 --> 02:00:45.620]   if I think it's worthwhile, even at my own expense.
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:49.460]   But to get to that point is a rarity.
[02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:51.260]   Like it's just not a given.
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:54.100]   And so you can even imagine like being a grade school teacher
[02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:55.260]   and this kid doesn't respect you
[02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:57.860]   and he doesn't really think you're that smart.
[02:00:57.860 --> 02:01:00.140]   They don't really appreciate that.
[02:01:00.140 --> 02:01:01.620]   - So cyberpunk is number one.
[02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:02.460]   What else is there?
[02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:03.300]   - Cyberpunk is kinda number one.
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:05.500]   It's an environment I love, but at the same time,
[02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:07.140]   Conan the Barbarian by John Milius
[02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:09.340]   is one of my favorite films of all time.
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:15.340]   And that's such a pure film in a way.
[02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:17.060]   Like the motivations are pure.
[02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:22.060]   They're very easy to follow, but not lacking in depth.
[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:29.140]   It's not just explosions and teal and orange.
[02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:33.980]   It's more on the human condition and I love it.
[02:01:33.980 --> 02:01:36.380]   And it's shot incredibly well.
[02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:38.300]   It's got an incredible soundtrack.
[02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:39.860]   Yeah, I fucking love it.
[02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:42.140]   But with Blade Runner also in a deeper sense,
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:43.620]   again, the human condition.
[02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:45.820]   You start seeing like what is being?
[02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:47.860]   What is being human?
[02:01:47.860 --> 02:01:51.340]   How does this relate to, if you can make it
[02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:52.900]   and you can tell it what to do,
[02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:56.860]   at what point is it like you should or you shouldn't?
[02:01:56.860 --> 02:01:58.940]   Why do you get to determine what's alive
[02:01:58.940 --> 02:01:59.780]   and what's not?
[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:02.700]   What's a life that should be allowed to live and what isn't?
[02:02:02.700 --> 02:02:07.700]   And what would be the strain of being Roy Batty
[02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:12.260]   and seeing all these incredible moments
[02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:17.140]   that with his passing will no longer exist?
[02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:18.940]   Especially if he hasn't had a chance
[02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:22.680]   to put that flame into another torch, so to speak.
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:23.940]   If he hasn't written them down,
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:26.740]   if he hasn't passed them down to somebody else.
[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:30.340]   Gone like tears in the rain.
[02:02:30.340 --> 02:02:33.220]   - Like tears in the rain, that scene is incredible.
[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:35.180]   But it's funny 'cause those two universes
[02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:36.740]   are very different according to the barbarian
[02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:39.580]   and cyberpunk 'cause that makes me curious
[02:02:39.580 --> 02:02:41.820]   about what else might be in the list.
[02:02:41.820 --> 02:02:44.380]   - Well, let me think.
[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:45.300]   It's a pretty--
[02:02:45.300 --> 02:02:48.300]   - Do you like the Godfather type of universes?
[02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:49.380]   - No, I mean, I'm sure the Godfather.
[02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:51.300]   I've never actually even watched the whole Godfather.
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:54.580]   - No, but also like was it Casino, Goodfellas?
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:56.980]   - Goodfellas is a good movie, but no, that's not in my top.
[02:02:56.980 --> 02:02:58.580]   It's a good flick.
[02:02:58.580 --> 02:03:00.380]   But it doesn't really do it for me.
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:03.460]   If people really wanna get into this a little more,
[02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:07.260]   I did make a list of 100 of my favorite movies
[02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:08.580]   on my Facebook fan page.
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:09.420]   - Nice.
[02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:12.180]   Do you remember like some--
[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:14.260]   - Oh yeah, like Blazing Saddles is on there,
[02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:18.780]   Rage of the Lost Ark, Valhalla Rising
[02:03:18.780 --> 02:03:21.020]   by Nicholas from Winding Refn,
[02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:25.700]   Maniac by William Lustig.
[02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:30.700]   It's a 1980 gnarly, video nasty horror movie
[02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:36.740]   about a serial killer who murders women and scalps them.
[02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:41.580]   And it's gnarly as hell and very brutal and very bleak
[02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:46.580]   and very, I mean, it's the kind of thing
[02:03:46.580 --> 02:03:47.500]   that like a lot of people
[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:49.340]   would have a real hard time watching.
[02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:53.100]   But one, again, I like things that are dark,
[02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:55.420]   but two, I thought the performances
[02:03:55.420 --> 02:03:57.220]   were fantastic in this film.
[02:03:57.220 --> 02:03:59.100]   And they really got out, I think,
[02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:00.300]   what the underlying thing was.
[02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:05.300]   And it was a guy who was basically just like run amok
[02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:08.620]   by the overbearing mother, Jungian archetype.
[02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:12.700]   And she imparted her insanity into him.
[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:17.140]   But yet there is this aspect you could see
[02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:19.580]   of him wanting to try and actually be able
[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:22.820]   to be in the world and have love
[02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:27.820]   and have feminine companionship
[02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:31.620]   to go with his masculine aspect.
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:34.580]   But he had no way of understanding
[02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:36.420]   how to really make that happen.
[02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:40.220]   And he had a complete negative connotation to the feminine.
[02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:42.820]   So it's his struggle with,
[02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:45.860]   and there's a little part in the movie
[02:04:45.860 --> 02:04:50.860]   where he somehow comes across this model or something.
[02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:55.020]   And then actually he starts to feel like
[02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:57.180]   maybe he might be able to actually have a relationship
[02:04:57.180 --> 02:04:59.660]   with somebody and it goes somewhere.
[02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:02.860]   But yeah, even the Elijah Wood remake,
[02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:05.460]   I felt was really well done and captured
[02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:07.380]   most of the essence of what the movie was about.
[02:05:07.380 --> 02:05:09.540]   But I still feel like the original
[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:12.540]   by William Lustig is the best.
[02:05:12.540 --> 02:05:16.860]   - What's the greatest love movie of all time?
[02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:18.900]   - Greatest love movie of all time.
[02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:20.220]   - So like something where love is,
[02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:22.820]   I mean, I suppose love underlies most of these movies,
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:24.020]   and especially if you like the dark.
[02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:26.380]   - I mean, hell, Takashi Miike's films
[02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:28.740]   are all about family of all things.
[02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:31.180]   As bonkers as those movies are,
[02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:34.660]   the general theme is family almost entirely
[02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:35.920]   in all of his films.
[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:38.580]   - Yeah, there's very, I mean,
[02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:39.860]   even you can argue Blader on it.
[02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:40.700]   Yeah, it's everywhere.
[02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:43.180]   - Greatest love film of all time?
[02:05:43.180 --> 02:05:48.660]   That's, I mean, is Excalibur a film about love?
[02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:51.380]   - What's Excalibur about?
[02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:52.220]   - King Arthur.
[02:05:52.220 --> 02:05:57.780]   Excalibur is about Arthur becoming king of the Britons
[02:05:57.780 --> 02:06:01.580]   and his love of his country and his love of Guinevere.
[02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:04.780]   But eventually, yeah, it becomes more of about
[02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:11.020]   the necessity for the king to love,
[02:06:11.020 --> 02:06:15.700]   to hold Excalibur, to stay,
[02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:18.380]   to realize that while if you're the king,
[02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:21.420]   you can love your wife and you can love your best friend,
[02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:25.940]   and they may fuck each other behind your back
[02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:27.860]   and as they fall in love too,
[02:06:27.860 --> 02:06:29.820]   but at the end of the day, your responsibility,
[02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:33.380]   your love has to be to the country and everyone else first
[02:06:33.380 --> 02:06:36.660]   and not your own personal wants,
[02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:40.380]   which made a much more interesting story
[02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:43.340]   when you have Carmen Berenina and,
[02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:46.420]   or was it, oh, what is that one?
[02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:50.580]   It's a German opera, but, and horses and slow-mo
[02:06:50.580 --> 02:06:53.420]   and sword fights and an epic death scene
[02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:56.900]   between Arthur and his son.
[02:06:56.900 --> 02:06:58.260]   - Okay, I'll definitely have to watch it,
[02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:01.060]   and I haven't watched it in embarrassing.
[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:05.300]   - It is John Borman's second film in Hollywood,
[02:07:05.300 --> 02:07:07.420]   his first one being Point Blank with Lee Marvin,
[02:07:07.420 --> 02:07:08.940]   which is also on top,
[02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:11.280]   one of the upper echelon movies on my list,
[02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:17.180]   derived from a book by, called The Outfit by,
[02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:20.380]   what is his name?
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:24.820]   I forget, but Darwin Cook, the comics illustrator,
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:26.500]   he did, Donald Westlake wrote,
[02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:29.980]   so Darwin Cook does an amazing comic book send-up
[02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:33.820]   of Darwin Cook's novels, and they are fucking incredible.
[02:07:33.820 --> 02:07:37.720]   So anyways, but the Point Blank with Lee Marvin,
[02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:43.180]   it's a man driven by purpose, revenge,
[02:07:43.180 --> 02:07:46.620]   but also by really pure motivations.
[02:07:46.620 --> 02:07:47.620]   He wants his money.
[02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:52.500]   He was betrayed, and he wants his cash,
[02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:54.480]   because this is what he agreed to do the thing for,
[02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:56.780]   and this is, which also is part of the reason
[02:07:56.780 --> 02:07:58.560]   why I like No Country for Old Men so much,
[02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:02.140]   which I felt was a great movie, even better book,
[02:08:02.140 --> 02:08:03.900]   but I remember talking to my friend,
[02:08:03.900 --> 02:08:08.260]   and I go, you know, Anton Chigurh is the most pure
[02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:09.980]   human being in that whole book.
[02:08:09.980 --> 02:08:11.180]   Well, that guy's the villain.
[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:13.580]   I go, ha ha, is he evil?
[02:08:13.580 --> 02:08:17.300]   He's the one, he lies to no one.
[02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:19.380]   He does everything he says he will do.
[02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:22.420]   He always follows his word, and on the rare occasion,
[02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:24.940]   he allows fate to make a decision,
[02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:27.540]   as he figures, like, well, whatever all led us to here
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:30.540]   will lead us one way or the other,
[02:08:30.540 --> 02:08:32.220]   and if we're at this crossroads,
[02:08:32.220 --> 02:08:34.700]   how is there any better or worse way
[02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:36.500]   than to do it over a coin flip?
[02:08:36.500 --> 02:08:39.540]   And so that whole scene where the guy's going,
[02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:40.940]   well, what am I putting up?
[02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:42.060]   And he goes, everything.
[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:44.860]   You've been putting it up every day of your life,
[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:46.000]   and that's true.
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:51.000]   Everything we do is a decision, is a calling, is a choice.
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:55.780]   And then it bummed me out that they reduced
[02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:57.420]   the last interaction between Chigurh
[02:08:57.420 --> 02:09:02.020]   and what's-his-face's wife, and he finally finds her,
[02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:03.580]   and she's like, you don't have to do this.
[02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:05.620]   And he's like, yes, I do.
[02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:06.780]   This is the way it is.
[02:09:06.780 --> 02:09:08.260]   You can think that your life could have turned out
[02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:09.860]   any sort of way, you could have done this,
[02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:11.140]   you could have done that, but the reality is
[02:09:11.140 --> 02:09:11.980]   this is the way your life is,
[02:09:11.980 --> 02:09:14.500]   and it's the way it was always going to be.
[02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:18.620]   The fact that I'm here is the end of it, and that's that.
[02:09:18.620 --> 02:09:20.540]   - Yeah, it's funny, if you're honest,
[02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:21.980]   this is what dark movies reveal,
[02:09:21.980 --> 02:09:26.980]   that the villains are the purest of humans,
[02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:30.300]   and can teach us the most profound lessons,
[02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:32.540]   and that's certainly an example of it.
[02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:34.780]   What do you think, the big, ridiculous,
[02:09:34.780 --> 02:09:36.660]   last philosophical question, what do you think
[02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:39.940]   is the meaning of this whole thing we've got going on,
[02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:42.180]   of life and existence on Earth,
[02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:43.640]   from your individual perspective,
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:45.580]   but the entirety of the human species?
[02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:48.620]   - Life, the universe, and everything?
[02:09:48.620 --> 02:09:49.460]   - Yeah.
[02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:51.460]   Don't.
[02:09:51.460 --> 02:09:53.700]   (laughing)
[02:09:56.940 --> 02:09:57.780]   - We could just leave it at that.
[02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:00.380]   - You knew exactly where I was going, I love it.
[02:10:00.380 --> 02:10:03.260]   - Josh, I love you very much, you've been a huge inspiration.
[02:10:03.260 --> 02:10:07.020]   - I have a friend who, she said,
[02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:09.580]   "Do you know Lex Friedman, have you gone on Lex's?"
[02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:11.820]   And I go, "Yes, I know Lex Friedman is."
[02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:15.380]   I've sadly been way too long in contact
[02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:17.700]   without making it happen for too long,
[02:10:17.700 --> 02:10:21.700]   and yes, I will 100%, I even cut a shirt
[02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:23.060]   at the beginning of the pandemic
[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:25.060]   to make my own little mask at one point,
[02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:27.020]   due to the Lex process.
[02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:27.860]   (laughing)
[02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:31.180]   And I love it, I can't really hear you,
[02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:32.260]   but I'm demonstrating.
[02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:33.940]   (laughing)
[02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:36.340]   Just see it through, but this has been a blast,
[02:10:36.340 --> 02:10:37.980]   and I hope you come back.
[02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:41.020]   - Next time, let's drink some of the Warbringer whiskey.
[02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:44.380]   - I will bring some Warmaster, I wasn't sure
[02:10:44.380 --> 02:10:47.780]   if you imbibed at all in spirits.
[02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:51.520]   - 100%, it felt a little weird to do it early on
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:53.540]   in the morning, especially 'cause I'm flying out there.
[02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:54.380]   - Does it though?
[02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:57.580]   I mean, I've had some wonderful morning whiskey at times.
[02:10:57.580 --> 02:11:00.940]   - Now that you've mentioned it, it doesn't at all.
[02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:02.740]   So next time, let's make sure,
[02:11:02.740 --> 02:11:06.700]   what Joe Rogan calls the adult beverages,
[02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:08.620]   let's make sure we indulge.
[02:11:08.620 --> 02:11:11.220]   - I have zero reservations for doing such a thing,
[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:12.460]   I'm into it.
[02:11:12.460 --> 02:11:14.020]   - Josh, thanks for talking today.
[02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:14.860]   - My pleasure.

[02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:39.300]   from Sun Tzu in the art of war.
[02:11:39.300 --> 02:11:42.740]   "The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy
[02:11:42.740 --> 02:11:44.580]   "without fighting."
[02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:47.340]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:49.920]   (upbeat music)
