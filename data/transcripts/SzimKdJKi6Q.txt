[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.200]   It's episode number 400, and such a milestone should be marked with an epic episode.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.720]   And you ask the questions, I offer them to Pastor John, and he answers them.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.800]   That's how it works on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.800]   And we get a lot of questions about relationships and dating and marriage, and of course, a
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.840]   lot of questions about sex.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.400]   And that leads to episodes that may not be suitable for all listeners and are really
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.080]   designed to be listened to by married couples, and that's the case today.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.720]   In the last month, 10 questions have arrived on the question of oral sex.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.920]   The question is all the same, Pastor John, is this a practice that's permissible in a
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.120]   Christian marriage, or is this always sinful?
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:53.860]   Questions relating to sexual intimacy should, I think, be handled with what you might call
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:02.040]   verbal modesty rather than shocking or crass words.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:10.000]   I think dressing and talking in the immodest ways are both wrong.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.080]   So that's kind of governing some of my language now.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.120]   These are real concerns.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.320]   I'm okay with this question.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.300]   It's a little bit, you know, difficult and sensitive, but it's okay.
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:31.440]   People want biblical guidance, and so here's my effort at biblical wisdom.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.320]   First of all, I'm assuming the question is only relating to people who are married.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.040]   When I give this counsel, I think it is wrong outside marriage.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.620]   And we could talk about that another time more extensively, but here's the short answer
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.240]   why.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:57.720]   Oral sex is even more intimate and delicate, it seems, than copulation.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.040]   And we know this because even married couples are wondering if they should go there.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.220]   It's as if it's a stage of intimacy that may not even be proper for married people.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.960]   And so to think it can be an innocent substitute for copulation so people can obey the letter
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.240]   of the law outside marriage is a mirage.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.880]   That's the first observation.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.000]   In marriage, here's what I would say.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.280]   If oral sex is wrong, I can think of four possible reasons it would be wrong.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.960]   I'll name them, and then I'll ask this question.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.280]   Do those four things exist?
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.480]   Number one, it would be wrong if it were prohibited in the Bible.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.680]   Number two, it would be wrong if it were unnatural.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.180]   Number three, it would be wrong if it were unhealthy, or that is, harmful.
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.960]   Number four, it would be wrong if it were unkind.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.480]   So let's take those one at a time.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:09.360]   Number one, I don't think oral sex is explicitly prohibited in any biblical command.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.280]   If the Bible proscribes it, it would have to be by principle and not by an explicit
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   command.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.800]   Number two, is it unnatural?
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.560]   This is a tricky one.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:31.440]   The male and female genitals are so clearly made for each other that there is a natural
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.920]   fitness or beauty to it.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.920]   What about oral sex?
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.520]   Now you might jump to the conclusion and say, "Nope, that's not natural."
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:52.440]   But I'm slow to go there because of what the Proverbs and the Song of Solomon say about
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.400]   a wife's breasts.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.720]   This is kind of an analogy, so consider this.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:06.160]   It seems to me nothing is more natural than a baby snuggling in his mother's arms, drinking
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.120]   at her breast.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.080]   That's what breasts are.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.320]   They're designed to feed babies.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:22.760]   So is there anything physically natural about a husband's fascination with his wife's breasts?
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.560]   Well, you might say, "No, that's not what breasts are for."
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:38.600]   But Proverbs 5.19 says, "Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight, be intoxicated
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.400]   always with her love."
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.800]   And Song of Solomon 7, 7 and 8 are even more explicit.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.960]   Speaking of the woman, "Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.960]   clusters.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.880]   I say, I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its fruit.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.680]   Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine."
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:16.520]   Well, even though there is very little anatomical correlation between a man's hands or his
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:27.600]   lips and his wife's breasts, it surely seems to be "natural" in another way, namely a built-in
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:38.880]   delight and desire that God, in his Word, seems to commend for our marital enjoyment.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:47.560]   So I ask, well, might there be similar desires for oral sex or other kinds of sex?
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.840]   So I doubt that we should put a limit on a married couple based on the claim of it being
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   "unnatural."
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.440]   That's risky, but that's where I come down on the naturalness of it.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.440]   Here's number three.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.440]   Is it unhealthy or harmful?
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.960]   Well, it certainly might be if there are any sexually transmitted diseases present, and
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.600]   it could be performed in harmful ways.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.240]   And so the couple needs to be very honest and caring by not taking risks that would
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.720]   be unloving, which leads to the last one, number four.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.840]   Is it unkind?
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:34.760]   Now I think this one is probably the one that touches the rawest nerve and the one that
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.880]   has the greatest impact.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:48.560]   Will you pressure your spouse for oral sex if he or she finds it unpleasant?
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.120]   If so, then you are unkind.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.520]   It's a sin to be unkind.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.440]   Ephesians 4, 2, "Be kind to one another."
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.360]   But the key word here is "pressure."
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.920]   I know that 1 Corinthians 7, 4 says, "The wife does not have authority over her own
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.160]   body, but the husband does.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:19.120]   Likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does."
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.720]   And the context there is sex.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.040]   So what does that mean practically?
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:31.520]   Well, it means that both the husband and the wife have the right to say to the other, "I
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.280]   would like to blank."
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.720]   And both of them have the right to say, "I would rather not blank."
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:48.320]   And in a good marriage, the biblically beautiful marriage, both of them seek to outdo the other
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.880]   in showing kindness.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:58.280]   So those are my principles, Tony, that would guide, I think, the Christian couple in this
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.400]   matter of oral sex.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.680]   All right, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.280]   That was episode number 400.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.880]   I think it was epic.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.200]   Episode number 300 was epic.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.400]   200 was epic.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.000]   How epic, you can find out for yourself in the Ask Pastor John podcast archive, easily
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.280]   found in the app for the iPhone and the Android.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.560]   And biblical discernment is a good thing.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.520]   It's a great thing, as long as it's handled rightly.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.320]   But there's a wrong kind of discernment, and we're going to talk about that tomorrow.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.400]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.760]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.260]   [end]
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.260]   1.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.260]   Is there a difference between a Christian and a non-Christian?
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.260]   2.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.260]   Is there a difference between a Christian and a non-Christian?
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.260]   3.
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:34.260]   Is there a difference between a Christian and a non-Christian?
