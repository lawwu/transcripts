[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.520]   I often say that I'm trying to teach computers how to see.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.160]   And if I want to get more involved,
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.360]   I say I'm trying to teach computers
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.520]   how to learn how to see.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.060]   The problems we're tackling in terms of autonomous driving,
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.680]   the machine learning challenges are so complex.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.920]   And the expectation on robustness
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.400]   is so high that we have to leverage
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.160]   all our strengths combined.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160]   And so collaboration is extremely important.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.560]   For all the large scale serious experiments
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.960]   and research projects, the scalability
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.520]   of weights and biases, the customizability,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.280]   the fact that we can really build reports and live
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.960]   monitoring, not just like frozen reports of a conclusion,
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.960]   all these things are awesome features that really vastly
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.680]   improved our productivity by having this common lingua
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.680]   franca about experiment visualization and logging.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.840]   When you make the effort, because it's an effort,
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.280]   to spend a bit more time to integrate
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.200]   with the tools of the team, by yourself,
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.760]   you may go faster.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.360]   But together, we go further.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.920]   And this past six months, we've been extremely productive
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.160]   on the research front, submitting five papers
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.760]   to the top conferences in machine learning and computer
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.600]   vision.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.560]   I was really impressed with the productivity of the team
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.880]   and the creativity that was unleashed thanks
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.120]   to the benefits of this infrastructure.
