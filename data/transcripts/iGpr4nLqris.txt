[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.640]   - Hi Cal, my name is Mark.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.480]   I'm a software engineer in Michigan.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.640]   I'm married with a three-year-old son.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.600]   I have a really good job.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.840]   They respect my time and I'm able to keep my schedule
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.440]   under 40 hours a week.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.000]   And so I feel really good about that bucket
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.880]   of my life right now and the progress I've made
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.200]   in becoming a better employee.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.400]   And what I want is more quality time with my family.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.040]   Like a lot of adults, I struggle with the balance of family
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.200]   against all the other demands in my life.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.960]   I've got a good amount of weight to lose.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.560]   So I need a non-trivial amount of time for fitness.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.880]   A lot of household administration that comes up
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.960]   and then kind of separately household projects
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.860]   that I ended up being responsible for.
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.420]   And so family ends up feeling like just another chore.
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.560]   You look for inspiration on this
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.760]   and you get the social media version
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.520]   that portrays an unrealistic vision for the family.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.380]   So if in my professional life,
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.040]   I've become good at reflecting on how I work
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.720]   to become a better employee,
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.240]   how might I do the same thing for my family life?
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.320]   So that way I can improve how I approach
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.660]   being a father and a husband.
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.120]   Be curious some of the things that you do here
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.080]   or if there's anyone that you respect on this subject.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.920]   Thank you.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.760]   - Well, look, I'm pretty careful
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.160]   to have my household manager tell my nanny
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.260]   to bring my kids into my presence
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.860]   at least once a day for five minutes
[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.860]   so that I can say, "How was your day today?"
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.500]   And they say, "Yes, Papa, we had a good day."
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.100]   And then I give a subtle nod to my nanny
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.020]   and they bring the kids out and the household manager
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.820]   make sure I don't have to see them again for 24 hours.
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.820]   So that's what I would advise.
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.700]   Just make sure your staff brings your kids
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.340]   into your presence for a few minutes every day.
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.340]   By the way, there's people out there
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.380]   that somehow assume for whatever reason
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.740]   that somehow my life is like this
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.020]   where basically I just never see my kids
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.720]   and there's some sort of like giant staff
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.300]   that takes care of them for me.
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.680]   So not everyone's gonna get that joke.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.400]   Okay, so a couple of recommendations here.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.160]   One, good shut down, complete ritual.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.640]   So even if you are physically in the presence of your family
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.760]   if your mind is psychologically on work,
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.320]   this email I have to send, this meeting that's coming up,
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.800]   this thing that I may be not making much progress on,
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.920]   they're only getting a small bit of the benefit.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.580]   So definitely lean into your shutdown ritual.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.220]   Then make sure you're closing all the open loops.
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.620]   You have a good plan for the next day.
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.220]   That plan fits into a weekly plan.
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.660]   You can trust it.
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.400]   You're not missing anything.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.260]   You check that shutdown box in your time block planner
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.580]   or say a phrase like schedule shutdown complete
[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.900]   so that your brain can actually release work.
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.260]   I think that's really important.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.260]   Two, see if there's ways you can reduce the footprint
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.120]   of logistical or administrative non-family oriented
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.320]   time consuming work in your life.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.080]   So the whole point of working, not the whole point,
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.240]   but a large point of working is to get money in exchange
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.200]   for your time that that money can then be invested
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.080]   to get outcomes that are useful for you.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.260]   So it sounds like you're good at your job.
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.700]   You have a good job.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.040]   It's probably a well-paying job
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.500]   based on what I can tell from your question.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.960]   Don't be shy about saying,
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.940]   I want to invest a non-trivial amount
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.520]   of the money generated in this job
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.480]   to actually free up my time outside of the job.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.440]   I think sometimes we get in this mindset of,
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.520]   if I don't have to spend money on X, then I won't.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.840]   Like you have beat the system.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.220]   But if you have the money to spend
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.600]   and it's going to free up time,
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.120]   then maybe you should actually consider doing that
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.080]   if that is possible.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.680]   And you might have to really readjust your budget.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.600]   We're going to do less of this
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.700]   so that we can get more time to do that.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.160]   Someone who's written well about this
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.720]   is my friend, Laura Vanderkam.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.460]   And she has a book called "168 Hours."
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.340]   I always get numbers wrong when I do this,
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.480]   but I think it's 168 or 162,
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.560]   hundred something hours.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.840]   But anyways, it's about productivity.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.360]   And in particular, the intersection
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.640]   between household admin and productivity.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.640]   And she's a big advocate of,
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.440]   hey, if you can afford it,
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.700]   spend money to take things off your plate.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.680]   That's kind of the point of money, right?
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.940]   That if you happen to have it,
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.500]   that's a pretty good thing to use it on.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.520]   You could buy a nicer car or a, you know, whatever,
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.320]   a lot of unnecessary exercise equipment,
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.760]   or you might be able to get a yard crew
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.260]   so that you don't have to rake your leaves
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.680]   and weed for three hours on the weekend
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.760]   because you have a young kid
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.160]   and that's not really what you want to be doing.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.000]   So you want to reduce that time.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.080]   I mean, I'm kind of looking towards Jesse
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.600]   because he knows more about fitness than I do,
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.260]   but I'm not sure if I agree with this idea
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.400]   that if your goal is you need to lose weight,
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.220]   you're talking about that being a substantial
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.140]   time involving activity.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.980]   I mean, 80% of that is probably getting your diet in order.
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.340]   And do I have that more or less right?
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.860]   Like you got to lock in your diet.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.680]   That doesn't take any,
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.740]   it doesn't take any more time to eat clean
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.160]   than it does to eat junk.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.060]   And honestly, when it comes to weight,
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.620]   I mean, you're not going to go Peloton off
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.740]   if you're a guy that has the extra 20 pounds.
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.940]   The reason, the way that's going to go away
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.340]   is you're gonna stop eating so much sugar
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.140]   and you're gonna stop drinking so much beer.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.720]   And so, you know, maybe you need to go through a phase
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.580]   where you're really focused on your healthy eating
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.660]   and you have some sort of less time consuming,
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.660]   you know, trade intensity for time type of exercise.
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.460]   I mean, I do this, Jesse might shake his head here
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.620]   because he knows much more about fitness than I do.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.520]   My time saving hack with fitness,
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.100]   especially when I had young kids is I said,
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.180]   okay, I can't get to a gym necessarily.
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.520]   I can't do long exercising.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.400]   So what I did is I said,
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.060]   I'm gonna do a thousand pull-ups a month at a minimum.
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.140]   And some months are shorter than others.
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.460]   So I just do 36 pull-ups every day.
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.640]   It is really intense, but it only takes four minutes,
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.240]   especially once you get good at it, right?
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.100]   And it at least keeps your muscles moving or what have you
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.680]   and active and so they don't atrophy.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.120]   I mean, honestly, if you had to do that for a year,
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.960]   you know, a thousand pull-ups a month,
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.480]   a thousand pushups a month, and you're eating well,
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.040]   you're probably gonna be better off
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.600]   than the 90 minutes you're doing in the gym
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.480]   twice a week right now.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.440]   And then as your kids get older,
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.100]   you can actually go figure out how to do the stuff
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.800]   that you probably should be doing with weights, et cetera.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.600]   I don't know how that works, but all right.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.660]   So I'm just throwing that out there as well.
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.360]   All right, so we wanna summarize here,
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.040]   good shutdown routine.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.120]   Two, invest money where you can
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.280]   so that you have more time outside of work,
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.480]   taking things off your plate,
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.560]   taking things off your family's plate.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.080]   And three, you talked about this social media fantasy
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.080]   about what parenting life should be.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.700]   I've seen some of these accounts.
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.500]   As far as I can tell, parenting life is,
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.140]   if you're a woman, is all about you and your kids
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.220]   are wearing white linen and are in fields.
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.500]   So according to Instagram, it's like,
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.340]   what moms are supposed to do is be in fields with their kids
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.500]   and there's flowers and they're wearing white linen
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.120]   and they're very well lit.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.360]   And they're usually doing some sort of project,
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.180]   like we're pressing flowers between tissue paper
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.080]   to make a set of wind chimes
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.920]   with which we can celebrate Mother Gaia.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.540]   And I also have a kind of a nice glow behind me
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.760]   as I take the picture.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.320]   All right, we all know the reality is within seven seconds,
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.840]   the one kid will be eating the tissue paper
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.220]   while the other one is using the pressed flower
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.200]   to see if they can blind their sister
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.960]   by getting it ground up and blown into their eyes.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.520]   And somehow you have urine on your white linen dress
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.120]   because that's just how that goes down.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.980]   And if you're a man, as far as I can tell
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.560]   from the social media things,
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.080]   you basically are supposed to be, as far as I can tell,
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.800]   either a professional athletic coach
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.680]   who is training the next Olympic athlete out of their kids,
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.200]   or you have a full-fledged movie caliber special effects
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.880]   laboratory and maker shop
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.880]   in which you are building life-size robotic mechs
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.260]   that you can ride in and your kids can move around in
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.720]   and they're controlled, remote controlled,
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.120]   and you're videotaping it with professional level filming.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.760]   And these are these fun projects
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.960]   that you're doing with your kids.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.960]   All this is impossible.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.800]   No one actually really does all this, right?
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.720]   So ignore social media.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.760]   It's better to have, to be around.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.760]   Hey, you're just around.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.820]   We're having dinner together, I'm around, you know?
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.800]   And then having something you do with each of your kids.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.560]   And it might not be every day, but it might be,
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.520]   I'm helping this kid with baseball.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   So once a week I pick him up from the bus
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.880]   and we go by the playground and we play some baseball.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.520]   And this other kid we're into risk.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.120]   My oldest right now is really into risk.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.720]   We play a lot, we play some risk.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.560]   And that's just what we do.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.820]   And it's not every day, but we play risk or whatever.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.720]   You have a thing you're doing with their kids
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.200]   that your kids can think like, dad does this with me,
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.760]   even if it's just once a week, right?
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.080]   That's kind of where you need to be.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.960]   And you're around and you're not lost.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.520]   And you're around and not with the leaf blower
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.440]   till 9 p.m. because you didn't wanna spend the 100 bucks
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.920]   to have someone come do your yard.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.840]   All of these things work together
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.000]   and I think you'll be much better off.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.260]   (upbeat music)
