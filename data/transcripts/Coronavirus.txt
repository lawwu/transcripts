[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and I just want to check in with you guys. It's been a while. It's February 24th and
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.000]   S&P 500 corrected 3.4%
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.600]   Due to fears of the corona virus the COVID - 19
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:25.120]   Corona virus and I feel like I'm in the twilight zone here a little bit because I still have this respiratory illness
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.520]   That has been afflicting me since early January end of December it went away for a couple weeks
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.640]   And then it came back feels like this season's flu season is much worse than expected or maybe it's simply because
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.840]   My boy's gonna preschool and he's just like the germ machine and he's bringing everything back
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.960]   So I wanted to share some thoughts on the corona virus and how we should position ourselves
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.840]   Because things could get a little bit dicey
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.320]   Definitely volatility is back and I think we need to talk about our finances and our asset allocation
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.480]   In this time of uncertainty and I think it's always good to talk about it with your loved ones with your friends with your partner
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.760]   And with yourself
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.400]   So first and foremost, I think first quarter earning results for 2020 are likely to disappoint
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.280]   Especially if the corona virus continues to spread and grow in cases
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.920]   in February and March
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.200]   Remember first quarter is January February March and they're gonna be reporting numbers in April and May and I think that chances are high that
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.080]   Companies are gonna disappoint and when you disappoint on earnings stock prices the S&P 500 goes down
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.080]   And I think there's a good chance
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.280]   The longer the corona virus lingers that CEOs of all these companies are going to use this opportunity
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.240]   I say opportunity in quotes. It's not a really great opportunity. It's not a great situation
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.720]   But this opportunity to kitchen sink their earnings. So whatever operational problems they had in the first quarter
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.920]   oftentimes or sometimes
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.680]   CEOs CFO CEOs will use some kind of exogenous variable in this case the corona virus
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:16.080]   To put blame on why their earnings didn't come to fruition or didn't meet guidance and this buys them
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.560]   You know another three months of time right because it's just all on quarterly earnings results
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.000]   So you just want to really pay attention to the count and the numbers supposedly as of February 24th
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.400]   there's something like
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.840]   80,000 cases across
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.440]   30 countries
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.600]   There's about 2700 deaths and so the numbers are probably going to continue upward
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.800]   But hopefully the trajectory will slow down. We just don't know for sure. But if it doesn't slow down
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.960]   There's probably a greater and greater chance that first quarter earnings are going to disappoint
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.440]   So if you're an equity investor like I am like I'm assuming most of you guys are
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.960]   Just be aware that things aren't looking that great to look at the bond market Wow the 30-year bond yield has
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.640]   Breached 2% it went down to around 1.85%
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.920]   That's an all-time low folks and then the 10-year bond yield has gone down to about 1.38%
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.160]   That's basically an all-time low. I mean we hit that low in 2016 about 1.35%
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.000]   But that is really interesting. It's really telling so the bond markets a bull market the stock market
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.760]   Before this three and a half percent correction was a bull market. It's still a bull market, right?
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.280]   So we're in an everything bull market. So usually when the bond market is this strong
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.720]   it means that investors are seeking the safety of bonds and usually a
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.280]   Massive ramp in bonds is a telling sign that the economy is going to be slowing down or something's in trouble, right?
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.480]   And so something has to give and we don't know for sure whether the stock market is going to give back
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.560]   All of its gains or some of its gains from 2019 or whatnot
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.720]   But it's really telling the bond market is really telling that we should be careful in the equity market
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.720]   The number one thing all of us homeowners can do is refinance our mortgage
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.240]   And I refinance my mortgage in 2019 to a 7-1 arm at 2.625%
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.880]   No points, no cost. I actually got it about a $250. Maybe it was $350 credit
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.400]   I'm set for the next seven years
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.280]   and if you haven't refinanced your mortgage in the past one year or two years definitely check and
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.640]   Definitely set yourself up and lock in a great rate because again
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.640]   We're almost at all-time lows in the 10-year bond yield and we are at all-time lows with a 30-year bond yield
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.400]   So why not lock in these low rates and at least improve your cash flow by saving on mortgage interest?
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.040]   If you've been thinking about buying property and you need to buy property whether it's because you want to settle down for the next five
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.160]   To ten plus years you need a bigger home because you have another child on the way or your first child
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.320]   Now is probably as good a time as any because the market has been softening for the past couple years
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.480]   Mortgage rates have been falling and therefore affordability has gone up
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.320]   Don't underestimate the wealth effect the stock market has given us in
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.560]   2019 I mean a 31% increase in stocks
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.660]   I don't care what your allocation 20% 40% 80% 100% of your net worth. That is a huge move
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:30.640]   Historically because the stock market is historically provided about an 8 to 10 percent return. So 31% is a 3x greater
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.840]   return on average and it is just logical that people are going to feel wealthier and
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.480]   they're going to asset allocate into perhaps something more tangible and more real and
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:49.960]   That is the real estate market. The real estate market is relatively defensive. It's a tangible asset. So it just doesn't go poof
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:58.320]   The very next day out of coronavirus fears it provides utility which is shelter and then it provides income which is rental income
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:06.480]   So money should logically flow to real estate and away from more risky stocks in this type of environment
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.520]   Especially with interest rates going down and you can think about real estate more like a bond
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.560]   Now whether it's a corporate bond or a high-yield junk bond or a treasury bond
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:25.520]   It depends on what type of real estate you buy but when rates are going down real estate generally outperforms other asset classes
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.120]   so I personally believe that real estate will outperform the S&P 500 in
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.360]   2020 just like how real estate outperformed the S&P 500 in 2018
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.560]   I also think the bond market probably has like a 70% chance of outperforming the S&P 500 in
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.720]   2020 and the cash market. I mean, it's only
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:53.200]   Providing about a 1.75 percent yield. That's kind of like the best I've seen right now in the first quarter of 2020
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.580]   But 1.75 is really good folks because the 10-year bond yield is at
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.680]   1.35 so think about it
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:09.160]   You've got to hold the 10-year bond yield for 10 years to get 1.35 percent a year and then all your money back after 10
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.920]   years
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.600]   but with the online savings account, you can get 1.75 percent or
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:20.800]   40 basis points or 0.4 percent greater than the 10-year bond yield and you don't have to hold it for 10 years
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.120]   You can hold it for one month one year two years whatnot. So there is another arbitrage opportunity folks
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.880]   For those of you who want to build liquidity save cash get more conservative
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:39.560]   It's not a bad idea to really boost that percentage of your net worth and now as for the stock market
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:46.960]   I can only share what has happened in the past and if you look at the history of 3% plus drawdowns
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.200]   About 80% of the time you're gonna see a positive return after
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:59.840]   One month three months six months and 12 months and actually the percentage goes up on the 12 month mark
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:06.760]   In fact since about 2008 so since the financial crisis after 12 months
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:15.000]   Stocks are up double digits every single year since and that's just logical because it's been a bull market since 2009
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And if you want to go into the nitty-gritty about what happened during previous pandemics
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.200]   So the SARS virus I was covering Asian equities back in 2003
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.540]   So the start in global interest of SARS was March 25th
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:35.160]   2003 and the peak in global interest was around April 24th. So
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.440]   about a month
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:44.080]   you saw China and the Hong Kong market declined by about 9% and then one month after
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.960]   peak interest
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:54.400]   The markets rebounded about 15% in China and 10% in Hong Kong and then three months after the peak about 31% in China
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.400]   and 17% in Hong Kong
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.720]   so
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.200]   History suggests that you should use
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:06.280]   These pandemic situations to leg in and buy stocks. So what am I doing?
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.280]   I actually have a lot of cash
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:15.640]   Because I've gotten a lot of distributions from my real estate crowdfunding investments that I made in 2016 and 2017
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.840]   So I'm legging in I said it earlier in a newsletter
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:26.320]   And I think in a post and my plan is to leg in with every single 2% plus
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.800]   sell down
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:36.640]   So on February 24th, I legged in about 30% of my cash because the market went down three and a half percent
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.800]   and
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.360]   If the market rebounds, I'm just gonna sit tight and if the market corrects another 2% or more
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:49.600]   I'm probably gonna leg in again and again and again and the reason why I just don't go all-in is because I clearly don't
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.920]   Know what the bottom is. We've run so far
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:58.000]   But also the reason why I am legging in is because I'm relatively underweight
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.860]   Equities since I bought a new primary residence in 2019
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.520]   I used a lot of my profits from 2019 to buy a
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:12.140]   Larger home for my growing family and I'm underweight equities by about 4% of my total net worth. So my
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.340]   equity exposure as a percentage of my net worth is about
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.920]   21% something like that and I wanted to get it about 25%
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.760]   So I want to increase exposure
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.600]   But 25% is what I'm comfortable with and you've got to figure out what you're comfortable with
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.240]   The rest of my net worth is composed of real estate
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:38.820]   I think that's 35 40 percent and the bond market a lot of municipal bonds because they're double taxation free
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:44.680]   And also financial samurai is worth something and then also cash and private
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.580]   Investments such as real estate crowdfunding private equity investments and venture debt
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:54.320]   So if you're fortunate enough to have a job or a steady source of income wherever that might come from
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:01.240]   You should probably come up with a plan as to how you're gonna take advantage of market volatility
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.560]   Whether it's legging in every 1% 2% 3%
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.240]   Whether it's refinancing a mortgage whether it's beefing up your defensive bond portfolio
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:17.160]   You've got to look at your asset allocation and compare it to your financial goals and your risk tolerance
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:23.100]   Don't look at my risk tolerance and the way I invest and say hey, I'm gonna follow exactly what Sam does
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:28.980]   Because you're not me. I have two kids to provide for now. I don't have a steady job and
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:34.760]   I'm relatively risk averse even though it looks like I might swing for the fences for some of these things
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:40.600]   But on a percentage basis, I think I'm pretty relatively conservative, especially for someone my age
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:45.940]   I think the best case scenario we can hope for is that there is a temporary sell-off
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.680]   Maybe it's a 10% total correction
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:55.440]   You're able to accumulate some positions in some stocks or indices that you enjoy and then we see a v-shaped
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:02.480]   recovery in demand and production after the first quarter and the market looks beyond the first quarter results as a
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.520]   misogynist variable that's not
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:11.960]   Fundamental and long-term in nature. That's the best case scenario and I would say that's probably a
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:19.080]   60 to 70 percent scenario and when you're investing you can't think about absolutes you got to think in bets
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:26.200]   So that is probably a 60 70 percent scenario. I think there's like a 10 to 20 percent scenario
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:32.720]   This could be the start of something much worse like maybe a 20% correction in which case you've got a mentally
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:39.000]   Exercise your mind and look at your positions and say how would you feel if you lost 20% of your position?
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.140]   Of your net worth or your investments and if you feel really really bad
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:48.440]   Well, maybe you might have to do some altering of your asset allocation
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:54.680]   But again, I want all of us to have a conversation because it's during difficult times volatile times
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:00.400]   But I think we can learn the most where we can also plan the most and where we can also address
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:06.800]   Some things we've been neglecting for a while since the bull market tends to make us a little bit
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:14.040]   Sanguine a little bit lazy about our investments and our finances. So thanks so much folks
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:21.480]   I do hope everybody stays safe and healthy and as always I'll see you around on the financial samurai forum or in the comment section
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.260]   Of a latest post. Thank you
