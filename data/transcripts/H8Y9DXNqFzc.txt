[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   A few years back, we locked John Piper in a recording studio and told him he could not
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.000]   come out until he finished recording a series of video devotionals for the YouVersion Bible
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.480]   app.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.760]   And one of those devotions that came out of the recording was on Proverbs chapter three
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.600]   verses five and six.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.440]   What Pastor John delivered is what we're calling three steps to stop wasting your life.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.160]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.600]   Proverbs three verses five and six.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.880]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:47.500]   In all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:55.380]   That verse probably is the one that my mother quoted most often in writing me when I was
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.720]   in college and graduate school.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.680]   She was just put, without even writing it out, she'd put Proverbs three, five, and six.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.680]   And I think it's because the main aim of the verse is to walk in a straight path.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.920]   That means she didn't want me and I don't want you and God doesn't want us to veer off
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.600]   the path into disobedience or into a wasted life or into anything that would dishonor
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600]   him.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.600]   That's the goal.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.760]   To make your paths straight, straight to obedience, straight to everlasting joy, straight to a
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.060]   God honoring life.
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.160]   And he says there are three steps to get there, right?
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.320]   First trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.720]   So bank on the promises of God step by step in your life.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.520]   Make your life a moment by moment trusting in a good, holy, kind, loving, all providing,
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.360]   all satisfying God.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.240]   And then step two, he says, don't rely on your own understanding, which I think means
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:09.120]   a conscious choice not to be self-reliant, to say to yourself, "Self, you are inadequate.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.200]   Brain, you can't come up with enough wisdom on your own.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.800]   You have to turn away from self-reliance."
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.980]   Of course, that doesn't mean that you don't think and you don't plan.
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.280]   It just means you don't bank on it.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.760]   The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory belongs to the Lord.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.680]   So even in the midst of our planning and thinking and using our minds, we're leaning on something
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.680]   else.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.400]   We're not leaning on our own resources.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:44.160]   And then the third one is in all your ways acknowledge him, which I think means, the
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.720]   Hebrew says, in all your ways know him.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.320]   So at every turn, every new choice you have to make, every new conversation you're in,
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.640]   you're sending up a message, "God, I acknowledge you here.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.800]   I know you here.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.040]   I'm drawing you in here.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.880]   You are decisive here.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.240]   I need you here."
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.280]   And if we follow those, trust him, renounce self-reliance, bring him into every situation,
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.040]   he's going to make our path straight.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.560]   He's going to keep us from wasting our lives or destroying ourselves and others in the
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.000]   path of sin and bringing us to everlasting joy.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Amen.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.360]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.600]   And tomorrow, John Piper is back with us and we have a question.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.000]   Really it's a series of three questions.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.760]   Should pastors be paid?
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.080]   Should we meet in church buildings or houses?
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.360]   And should we have sermons every week?
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.580]   A three in one bonus episode, all that tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast with author
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.600]   and longtime pastor, John Piper.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.120]   We'll see you tomorrow.
