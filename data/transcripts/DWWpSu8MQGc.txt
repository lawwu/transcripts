[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.080]   - Lorna, a podcast listener in Ireland,
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.600]   writes in with an observant question for you.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.680]   Pastor John, the most popular question asked at Google
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.760]   is this, what is love?
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.420]   Why do you think so many people struggle to understand love
[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.860]   and how would you define it?
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.880]   - I think if we start with the definition,
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.840]   it will become clearer why so many people struggle
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.160]   to understand what love is.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.120]   So let's admit that there are
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.520]   very different kinds of love.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.260]   Or to put it another way, the word love can be used
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.760]   in many different ways.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.260]   So whenever we're asking what love is,
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.660]   like Lorna is asking me now,
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.700]   in a sense I need to respond and say,
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.700]   according to whose definition,
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.800]   or according to what document,
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.940]   or according to what passage of scripture.
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.300]   So for example, C.S. Lewis,
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.760]   and I would recommend this very highly,
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.360]   in his book, "The Four Loves,"
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.800]   distinguishes eros, kind of romantic love
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.000]   where the lovers are hungry for each other,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.420]   and philos, friendship love,
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.440]   where two people are linked arm in arm,
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.460]   shoulder to shoulder with a common vision
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.060]   and a common goal and a delight in that partnership
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.580]   of pulling together toward the goal.
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.180]   And storge, affection that one might have
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.620]   for an old sweater, or slippers,
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.620]   an old dog that you just can't let go.
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.780]   And agape, divine love characterized by sacrifice
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.360]   and the pursuit of another person's good.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.780]   So just from Lewis, you see,
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.800]   well, which one of those do you want me to define
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.580]   when you say what is love?
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.040]   So that's part of the reason why people are groping
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.420]   is because the word love has so many different references,
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.280]   and it's not a bad thing that it should.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.440]   Now what I have found most helpful
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.320]   is to divide love into two categories,
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.320]   and I got this first from Jonathan Edwards,
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.720]   but it goes way back beyond him,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.720]   and he divides love into love of complacency
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.720]   and love of benevolence.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.100]   And complacency would be I love pizza.
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.240]   And in other words, I find myself pleased
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.160]   by the qualities I find in pizza,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.920]   namely its taste.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.640]   That would be love of complacency,
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.680]   or you might love a place or a country or lots of things.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.520]   You could say you love them because they are lovely,
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.080]   they are pleasing to you,
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.600]   whereas the love of benevolence
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   is not based on the loveliness of the object of the love,
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.000]   but rather your goodwill, benevolent,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.600]   your goodwill toward the person
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.040]   or the thing that you're loving,
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.360]   and your aim in that kind of love is to do good,
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.880]   to bring about something beautiful,
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.520]   not respond to beauty.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.160]   So we could spend a long time discussing
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.600]   the nature of complacency in God
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.200]   and what it's like to know and enjoy and admire
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.360]   and be satisfied in God,
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   and we could spend a long time talking about benevolence
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.400]   to people who don't have the kind of admirable traits
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.960]   that make us drawn to them.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.240]   So what I think would be most helpful
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.480]   in response to the question
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.840]   is to give a biblical definition
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.920]   of the love of benevolence
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.960]   because this is the kind of love
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.400]   which in the Bible is celebrated
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.200]   as the heart of God's love.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.200]   So the magnitude of God's love of benevolence
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   is measured in the Bible by four criteria
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.960]   that I can see.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.480]   First, the degree to which the person loved
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.440]   does not deserve to be loved.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.680]   Second, the greatness of the price paid to love a person.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.000]   Third, the greatness of the good
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.040]   that is done for the person when he's loved.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.480]   And fourth, the level of desire
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.480]   that God has for the good of the one loved.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.960]   So let me just give an example of verse
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.520]   for each one of those.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.140]   So number one, in Romans 5, six to eight,
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.020]   God loves the least deserving
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.920]   and therefore his love is greater.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.240]   So for while we were still weak
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.280]   at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.320]   For one will scarcely die for a righteous person,
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.400]   but perhaps for a good person, one might even dare to die.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.160]   But God, different from all that,
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.540]   shows his love of his love, this is what love is,
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.520]   in that while we were sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.100]   So the first measure of the magnitude of God's love
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.100]   is we don't deserve it, and that's why it is great.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.280]   Second is the price he's willing to pay.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.520]   So John 15, 13, "Greater love has no one than this,
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.600]   "than that he lay down his life."
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.140]   And so the measure there in verse 13 of John 15
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.380]   is that it's measured not just by the fact
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.580]   that I don't deserve it,
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.720]   it's measured by the price he's willing to pay,
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.980]   namely his own son's life.
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.180]   And the third measure is the good
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.340]   that I get through this love,
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.620]   and in John 3, 16, that's called eternal life
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.820]   for God so loved the world, loved the world
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.220]   that he gave his only begotten son
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.520]   that whoever believes in him should not perish,
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.440]   but have eternal life.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.280]   And then he defines eternal life in chapter 17
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.180]   by saying it's to know God and to know Christ.
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.760]   So the greatest possible love
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.760]   gives the greatest possible gift, which is God himself.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.600]   And the fourth is did God do this begrudgingly,
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.360]   or does he do this with all his heart?
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.360]   And Zephaniah 3, 17, "The Lord your God is in your midst,
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.960]   a mighty one who will save.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.660]   He will rejoice over you with gladness.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.420]   He will quiet you by his love.
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.640]   He will exult over you with loud singing."
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.240]   And the same thing in Luke 15
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.260]   where the father sees the son coming home,
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.880]   and he hugs him, and he puts a ring on his hand,
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.220]   and robes, and shoes, and throws a party.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.700]   In other words, God is totally in to saving us.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.860]   He's not doing this, nobody's twisting God's arm.
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.800]   So the most beautiful love in the world
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.800]   is this divine love that pays the highest price,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.860]   the life of the son of God,
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.980]   for completely undeserving enemies, us,
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.740]   to give us the longest and greatest happiness
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.200]   in his presence, and he loves doing it.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.720]   And one last thing, if it sounds contradictory
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.600]   to say that the heart of God's love
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.520]   is benevolence toward unworthy people like us,
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.600]   and yet the ultimate goal of human life
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   is complacency in God, which I do think it is,
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.840]   I don't think that's really a contradiction.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.280]   And the reason it's not is because the ultimate aim
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.640]   of God's benevolence toward us
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.960]   is to give us complacency in himself.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.960]   So the love of benevolence ultimately serves in us
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.100]   the love of complacency in God.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.560]   So God doesn't have ultimate satisfaction in us,
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.320]   we have ultimate satisfaction in him.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.840]   God would be an idolater if his ultimate goal
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.360]   were complacency in us.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.560]   Rather, he works to give us ultimate complacency in him.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.560]   We don't love God by helping God out of deficiency into joy,
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.640]   but God does love us by helping us
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.760]   out of deficiency into joy.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.160]   But in both cases, our love for God and his for us,
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.400]   the ultimate aim is the same,
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.320]   that we find ultimate satisfaction in God, both of us,
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.320]   we and God finding, pursuing satisfaction in God,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.480]   in the display of God, the exalting of God.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.880]   So the ultimate goal of all things,
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.160]   and this may be the most helpful thing
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.400]   for the answer of this question,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   the ultimate goal of all things when the world is filled
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   with the display of the infinite value of God
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.080]   by treasuring him, people who treasure him,
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.240]   enjoying him above all things.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.440]   And in that sense, the goal of all things is love.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.600]   So if you ask me, why do you think so many people struggle?
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.360]   With understanding love, I would say no one,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.340]   apart from the Holy Spirit, will think of love
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.160]   like I just thought about it.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.400]   We are by virtue of our innate sinfulness,
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.080]   self-centered, not God-centered,
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.060]   and so we run in a thousand directions
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.720]   to get away from this truth that we find our full
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.880]   and lasting satisfaction in God,
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.700]   and God is benevolent toward us precisely
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.760]   in order to bring us into that enjoyment.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.360]   - That is a brilliant theological perspective of love.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.480]   Thank you, Pastor John,
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.680]   and thank you for the question, Lorna.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.640]   And speaking of love, in the past,
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.440]   we have asked this question on the podcast.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.360]   Do I love God, or do I just love loving God?
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.720]   That was episode number 345.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.080]   Also, we have an episode titled
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.560]   Helping Our Children Feel Loved by God.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.960]   That is episode number 563 with guest Ray Ortlund.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.260]   You can check out those episodes
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.720]   in the Ask Pastor John archive
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.560]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.240]   Tomorrow, John Piper will explain
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.080]   what is wrong with prohibition-centered holiness.
