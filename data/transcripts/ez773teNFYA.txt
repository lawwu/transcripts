[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram,
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.680]   a computer scientist, mathematician,
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.240]   and theoretical physicist,
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.800]   who is the founder and CEO of Wolfram Research,
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.600]   a company behind Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha,
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.360]   Wolfram Language, and the new Wolfram Physics Project.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.040]   He's the author of several books,
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.480]   including "A New Kind of Science,"
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.560]   which on a personal note,
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.600]   was one of the most influential books in my journey
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.980]   in computer science and artificial intelligence.
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.560]   It made me fall in love with the mathematical beauty
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.540]   and power of cellular automata.
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.120]   It is true that perhaps one of the criticisms of Stephen
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.960]   is on a human level, that he has a big ego,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.520]   which prevents some researchers
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.240]   from fully enjoying the content of his ideas.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.120]   We talk about this point in this conversation.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.520]   To me, ego can lead you astray,
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.800]   but can also be a superpower,
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.800]   one that fuels bold, innovative thinking
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.040]   that refuses to surrender to the cautious ways
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.680]   of academic institutions.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.240]   And here, especially, I ask you to join me
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.140]   in looking past the peculiarities of human nature
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.060]   and opening your mind to the beauty of ideas
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.300]   in Stephen's work and in this conversation.
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.540]   I believe Stephen Wolfram
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.700]   is one of the most original minds of our time,
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.340]   and at the core, is a kind, curious,
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.140]   and brilliant human being.
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.580]   This conversation was recorded in November, 2019,
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.980]   when the Wolfram Physics Project was underway,
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.680]   but not yet ready for public exploration as it is now.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.420]   We now agreed to talk again,
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.940]   probably multiple times in the near future,
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.520]   so this is round one, and stay tuned for round two soon.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.060]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.140]   If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.320]   review it with Five Stars and Apple Podcast,
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.260]   support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter,
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.940]   @LexFriedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.420]   As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now,
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.700]   and never any ads in the middle
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.780]   that can break the flow of the conversation.
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.280]   I hope that works for you,
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.180]   and doesn't hurt the listening experience.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.660]   Quick summary of the ads.
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.840]   Two sponsors, ExpressVPN and Cash App.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.500]   Please consider supporting the podcast
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.160]   by getting ExpressVPN at expressvpn.com/lexpod
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.020]   and downloading Cash App and using code LEXPODCAST.
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.340]   This show is presented by Cash App,
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.540]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.500]   When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.300]   Cash App lets you send money to friends,
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.580]   buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.420]   with as little as $1.
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.940]   Since Cash App does fractional share trading,
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.640]   let me mention that the order execution algorithm
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.820]   that works behind the scenes
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.340]   to create the abstraction of fractional orders
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.340]   is an algorithmic marvel.
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.220]   So big props to the Cash App engineers
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.820]   for solving a hard problem
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.200]   that in the end provides an easy interface
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.860]   that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.420]   over the stock market.
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.980]   This makes trading more accessible for new investors
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.460]   and diversification much easier.
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.860]   So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store,
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.020]   Google Play, and use the code LEXPODCAST,
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.060]   you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.620]   an organization that is helping to advance robotics
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.300]   and STEM education for young people around the world.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.580]   This show is presented by ExpressVPN.
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.980]   Get it at expressvpn.com/lexpod
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.780]   to get a discount and to support this podcast.
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.580]   I've been using ExpressVPN for many years.
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.860]   I love it.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.020]   It's really easy to use.
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.220]   Press the big power on button and your privacy is protected.
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.620]   And if you like, you can make it look like your location
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.740]   is anywhere else in the world.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.500]   This has a large number of obvious benefits.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.180]   Certainly, it allows you to access international versions
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.340]   of streaming websites like the Japanese Netflix
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.680]   or the UK Hulu.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.800]   ExpressVPN works on any device you can imagine.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.260]   I use it on Linux.
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.060]   Shout out to Ubuntu.
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.180]   New version coming out soon, actually.
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.600]   Windows, Android, but it's available anywhere else too.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.900]   Once again, get it at expressvpn.com/lexpod
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.520]   to get a discount and to support this podcast.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.020]   And now, here's my conversation with Stephen Wolfram.
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.540]   You and your son, Christopher,
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.060]   helped create the alien language in the movie "Arrival."
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.340]   So let me ask maybe a bit of a crazy question,
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.980]   but if aliens were to visit us on Earth,
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.460]   do you think we would be able to find a common language?
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.060]   - Well, by the time we're saying aliens are visiting us,
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.300]   we've already prejudiced the whole story
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.460]   because the concept of an alien actually visiting,
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.860]   so to speak, we already know they're kind of things
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.140]   that make sense to talk about visiting.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.520]   So we already know they exist
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.820]   in the same kind of physical setup that we do.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.540]   They're not, you know, it's not just radio signals.
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.300]   It's an actual thing that shows up and so on.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.260]   So I think in terms of, you know,
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.960]   can one find ways to communicate?
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.380]   Well, the best example we have of this right now is AI.
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.980]   I mean, that's our first sort of example
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.680]   of alien intelligence.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.020]   And the question is, how well do we communicate with AI?
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.460]   You know, if you were to say,
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.420]   if you were in the middle of a neural net
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.780]   and you open it up and it's like, what are you thinking?
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.140]   Can you discuss things with it?
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.480]   It's not easy, but it's not absolutely impossible.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.020]   So I think by the time,
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.540]   but given the setup of your question, aliens visiting,
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.620]   I think the answer is yes,
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.660]   one will be able to find some form of communication,
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.940]   whatever communication means,
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.260]   communication requires notions of purpose
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.780]   and things like this.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.980]   It's a kind of philosophical quagmire.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.660]   - So if AI is a kind of alien life form,
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.940]   what do you think visiting looks like?
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.100]   So if we look at aliens visiting
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.660]   and we'll get to discuss computation
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.260]   and the world of computation,
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.060]   but if you were to imagine,
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.740]   you said you already prejudiced something
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.580]   by saying you visit, but how would aliens visit?
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.060]   - By visit, there's kind of an implication
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.300]   and here we're using the imprecision of human language,
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.980]   you know, in a world of the future.
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.040]   And if that's represented in computational language,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.860]   we might be able to take the concept visit
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.140]   and go look in the documentation basically
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.740]   and find out exactly what does that mean?
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.540]   What properties does it have and so on?
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.540]   But by visit in ordinary human language,
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.760]   I'm kind of taking it to be,
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.660]   there's, you know, something, a physical embodiment
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.260]   that shows up in a spacecraft
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.580]   since we kind of know that that's necessary.
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.940]   We're not imagining it's just, you know,
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.180]   photons showing up in a radio signal that,
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.340]   you know, photons in some very elaborate pattern.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.960]   We're imagining it's physical things made of atoms
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.980]   and so on that show up.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.220]   - Can it be photons in a pattern?
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.840]   - Well, that's good question.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.180]   I mean, whether there is the possibility,
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.540]   you know, what counts as intelligence?
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.620]   Good question.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.740]   I mean, it's, you know,
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.380]   and I used to think there was sort of a,
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.660]   oh, there'll be, you know, it'll be clear what it means
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.380]   to find extraterrestrial intelligence,
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.700]   et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.380]   I've increasingly realized as a result of science
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.140]   that I've done that there really isn't a bright line
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.340]   between the intelligent
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.980]   and the merely computational, so to speak.
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.460]   So, you know, in our kind of everyday sort of discussion,
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.300]   we'll say things like, you know,
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.300]   the weather has a mind of its own.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.740]   Well, let's unpack that question.
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.220]   You know, we realize that there are computational processes
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.580]   that go on that determine the fluid dynamics
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.540]   of this and that in the atmosphere,
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.020]   et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.220]   How do we distinguish that from the processes
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.100]   that go on in our brains of, you know,
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.020]   the physical processes that go on in our brains?
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.260]   How do we separate those?
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.980]   How do we say the physical processes going on
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.020]   that represent sophisticated computations in the weather?
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.220]   Oh, that's not the same as the physical processes
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.500]   that go on that represent sophisticated computations
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.660]   in our brains.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.540]   The answer is I don't think there is
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.820]   a fundamental distinction.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.860]   I think the distinction for us
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.620]   is that there's kind of a thread of history and so on
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.420]   that connects kind of what happens in different brains
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.020]   to each other, so to speak.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.300]   And it's a, you know, what happens in the weather
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.940]   is something which is not connected
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.820]   by sort of a thread of civilizational history, so to speak,
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.220]   to what we're used to.
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.860]   - In our story, in the stories
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.020]   that the human brain has told us,
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.140]   but maybe the weather has its own stories.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.100]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.220]   And that's where we run into trouble
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.220]   thinking about extraterrestrial intelligence
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.220]   because, you know, it's like that pulsar magnetosphere
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.180]   that's generating these very elaborate radio signals.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.380]   You know, is that something that we should think of
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.060]   as being this whole civilization
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.780]   that's developed over the last however long,
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.340]   you know, millions of years of processes going on
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.860]   in the neutron star or whatever
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.300]   versus what, you know, what we're used to
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.740]   in human intelligence.
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.860]   I mean, I think it's a, I think in the end,
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.820]   you know, when people talk
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.020]   about extraterrestrial intelligence and where is it
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.940]   and the whole, you know, Fermi paradox
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.420]   of how come there's no other signs of intelligence
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.620]   in the universe, my guess is that we've got sort of two
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.180]   alien forms of intelligence that we're dealing with,
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.380]   artificial intelligence and sort of physical
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.580]   or extraterrestrial intelligence.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.100]   And my guess is people will sort of get comfortable
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.220]   with the fact that both of these have been achieved
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.020]   around the same time.
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.220]   And in other words, people will say,
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.100]   well, yes, we're used to computers,
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.220]   things we've created, digital things we've created
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.260]   being sort of intelligent like we are.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.660]   And they'll say, oh, we're kind of also used to the idea
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.460]   that there are things around the universe
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.020]   that are kind of intelligent like we are,
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.100]   except they don't share the sort of civilizational history
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.140]   that we have.
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.740]   And so we don't, you know, they're a different branch.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.940]   I mean, it's similar to when you talk about life,
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.780]   for instance.
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.900]   I mean, you kind of said life form,
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.580]   I think almost synonymously with intelligence,
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.300]   which I don't think is, you know,
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.060]   the AIs would be upset to hear you equate those two things.
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.180]   - Because they really probably implied biological life.
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.300]   - Right, right.
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.060]   - But you're saying, I mean, we'll explore this more,
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.580]   but you're saying it's really a spectrum
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.860]   and it's all just a kind of computation.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.540]   And so it's a full spectrum and we just make ourselves
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.580]   special by weaving a narrative around
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.620]   our particular kinds of computation.
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.620]   - Yes, I mean, the thing that I think
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.860]   I've kind of come to realize is, you know,
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.780]   at some level it's a little depressing to realize
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.820]   that there's so little that's special about them.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.260]   - Or liberating.
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.380]   - Well, yeah, but I mean, it's, you know,
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.780]   it's the story of science, right?
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.180]   And, you know, from Copernicus on, it's like, you know,
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.660]   first we were like convinced our planets
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.300]   are the center of the universe.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.140]   No, that's not true.
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.860]   Well, then we were convinced there's something
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.460]   very special about the chemistry that we have
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.020]   as biological organisms.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.420]   No, that's not really true.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.700]   And then we're still holding out that hope.
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.260]   Oh, this intelligence thing we have, that's really special.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.340]   I don't think it is.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.780]   However, in a sense, as you say,
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.540]   it's kind of liberating for the following reason,
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:24.540]   that you realize that what's special is the details of us,
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.820]   not some abstract attribute that, you know,
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.340]   we could wonder, oh, is something else gonna come along
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.300]   and, you know, also have that abstract attribute?
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.740]   Well, yes, every abstract attribute we have,
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.300]   something else has it.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.860]   But the full details of our kind of history
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.340]   of our civilization and so on, nothing else has that.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.020]   That's what, you know, that's our story, so to speak.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.740]   And that's sort of almost by definition special.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.300]   So I view it as not being such a, I mean, I was,
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.300]   initially I was like, this is bad.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.580]   This is kind of, you know, how can we have self-respect
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.260]   about the things that we do?
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.820]   Then I realized the details of the things we do,
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.140]   they are the story.
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.240]   Everything else is kind of a blank canvas.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.800]   - So maybe on a small tangent, you just made me think of it,
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.860]   but what do you make of the monoliths in "2001 Space Odyssey"
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.020]   in terms of aliens communicating with us
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:28.020]   and sparking the kind of particular intelligent computation
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.460]   that we humans have?
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.920]   Is there anything interesting to get from that
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.900]   sci-fi?
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.120]   - Yeah, I mean, I think what's fun about that is,
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.820]   you know, the monoliths are these, you know,
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.060]   one to four to nine perfect cuboid things.
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.100]   And in the, you know, Earth a million years ago,
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.420]   whatever they were portraying with a bunch of apes
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.460]   and so on, a thing that has that level of perfection
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.940]   seems out of place.
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.300]   It seems very kind of constructed, very engineered.
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.540]   So that's an interesting question.
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.860]   What is the, you know, what's the techno signature?
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.340]   So to speak, what is it that you see it somewhere
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.860]   and you say, my gosh, that had to be engineered.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.540]   Now, the fact is we see crystals,
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.260]   which are also very perfect.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.820]   And you know, the perfect ones are very perfect.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.340]   They're nice polyhedra or whatever.
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.540]   And so in that sense, if you say, well,
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.340]   it's a sign of sort of, it's a techno signature
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.580]   that it's a perfect, you know,
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.300]   a perfect polygonal shape, polyhedral shape.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.500]   That's not true.
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.100]   And so then it's an interesting question.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.360]   What is the, you know, what is the right signature?
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.700]   I mean, like, you know, Gauss, famous mathematician,
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.140]   you know, he had this idea,
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.340]   you should cut down the Siberian forest
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.820]   in the shape of sort of a typical image
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.060]   of the proof of the Pythagorean theorem
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.340]   on the grounds that, it was a kind of cool idea,
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.340]   didn't get done, but you know,
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.980]   it was on the grounds that the Martians would see that
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.420]   and realize, gosh, there are mathematicians out there.
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.860]   It's kind of, you know, it's the,
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.160]   in his theory of the world,
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.740]   that was probably the best advertisement
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.660]   for the cultural achievements of our species.
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.980]   But you know, it's a reasonable question.
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:15.100]   What do you, what can you send or create
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.460]   that is a sign of intelligence in its creation
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.060]   or even intention in its creation?
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.420]   - Yeah, you talk about if we were to send a beacon,
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.740]   can you, what should we send?
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.740]   Is math our greatest creation?
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.180]   Is, what is our greatest creation?
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.860]   - I think, I think, and it's a,
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.100]   it's a philosophically doomed issue to, I mean,
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.780]   in other words, you send something,
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.620]   you think it's fantastic,
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.900]   but it's kind of like, we are part of the universe.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.860]   We make things that are, you know,
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.140]   things that happen in the universe.
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.780]   Computation, which is sort of the thing that we are,
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.140]   in some abstract sense,
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.180]   in a sense, using to create all these
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:59.180]   elaborate things we create, is surprisingly ubiquitous.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.220]   In other words, we might've thought that, you know,
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.380]   we've built this whole giant engineering stack
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.020]   that's led us to microprocessors,
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.580]   that's led us to be able to do elaborate computations,
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.820]   but this idea, the computations are happening
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.060]   all over the place.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.700]   The only question is whether there's a thread
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.660]   that connects our human intentions
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.740]   to what those computations are.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.780]   And so I think, I think this question of what do you send
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.860]   to kind of show off our civilization
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.500]   in the best possible way,
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.820]   I think any kind of almost random slab
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.820]   of stuff we've produced
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.380]   is about equivalent to everything else.
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.060]   I think it's one of these things where-
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.100]   - Such a non-romantic way of phrasing it.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.620]   I just, sorry to interrupt,
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.260]   but I just talked to Anne Druyan,
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.820]   who's the wife of Carl Sagan.
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.500]   And so, I don't know if you're familiar with "The Voyager,"
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.380]   I mean, she was part of sending, I think,
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.420]   brainwaves of, you know, I want you to-
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.380]   - Wasn't it hers?
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.780]   - It was hers. - Her family.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.620]   - Her brainwaves when she was first falling in love
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.660]   with Carl Sagan, right?
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.100]   So this beautiful story.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.180]   (laughing)
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.020]   - Right.
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:10.620]   - That perhaps you would shut down the power of that
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.460]   by saying we might as well send anything else,
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.060]   and that's interesting.
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.460]   All of it is kind of an interesting, peculiar thing
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.780]   that's- - Yeah, yeah, right.
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.220]   Well, I mean, I think it's kind of interesting, too,
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.100]   on the "Voyager" golden record thing,
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.580]   one of the things that's kind of cute about that is,
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.820]   you know, it was made, when was it,
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.860]   in the late '70s, early '80s.
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.900]   - Yeah.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.220]   - And, you know, one of the things,
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.660]   it's a phonograph record, okay?
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.940]   And it has a diagram of how to play a phonograph record.
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:36.780]   - Yeah, it does.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.540]   - And, you know, it's kind of like,
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.460]   it's shocking that in just 30 years,
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.820]   if you show that to a random kid of today
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:44.940]   and you show them that diagram,
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.460]   and I've tried this experiment,
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.220]   they're like, "I don't know what the heck this is."
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.260]   And the best anybody can think of is,
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.500]   you know, take the whole record,
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.420]   forget the fact that it has some kind of helical track in it,
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.260]   just image the whole thing and see what's there.
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.820]   That's what we would do today.
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.460]   In only 30 years, our technology has kind of advanced
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.820]   to the point where the playing of a helical,
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:09.060]   you know, mechanical track on a phonograph record
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.820]   is now something bizarre.
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.220]   So, you know, that's a cautionary tale, I would say,
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.940]   in terms of the ability to make something
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:22.060]   that in detail sort of leads by the nose some,
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.820]   you know, the aliens or whatever to do something.
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:28.260]   It's like, no, you know, best you're gonna do, as I say,
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.980]   if we were doing this today,
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.980]   we would not build a helical scan thing with a needle.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.060]   We would just take some high-resolution imaging system
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.980]   and get all the bits off it and say,
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.380]   "Oh, it's a big nuisance that they put in a helix,
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.820]   "you know, in a spiral.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.780]   "Let's just, you know, unravel the spiral
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.500]   "and start from there."
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:54.180]   - Do you think, and this will get into trying to figure out
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.300]   interpretability of AI, interpretability of computation,
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.500]   being able to communicate
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.580]   with various kinds of computations.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.940]   Do you think we'd be able to,
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.940]   if you put your alien hat on, figure out this record,
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.620]   how to play this record?
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.660]   - Well, it's a question of what one wants to do.
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.500]   I mean--
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.020]   - Understand what the other party was trying to communicate
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.420]   or understand anything about the other party.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.980]   - What does understanding mean?
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:22.940]   I mean, that's the issue.
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.900]   The issue is, it's like when people were trying to do
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.580]   natural language understanding for computers, right?
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.780]   So people tried to do that for years.
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.660]   It wasn't clear what it meant.
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.060]   In other words, you take your piece of English or whatever
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.300]   and you say, "Gosh, my computer has understood this."
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.740]   Okay, that's nice.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.220]   What can you do with that?
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.980]   Well, so for example, when we did, you know,
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:50.060]   built WolfMalpha, you know, one of the things was,
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.300]   it's, you know, it's doing question answering and so on,
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.500]   and it needs to do natural language understanding.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.660]   The reason that I realized after the fact,
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.820]   the reason we were able to do
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.260]   natural language understanding quite well,
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.340]   and people hadn't before,
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.860]   the number one thing was we had an actual objective
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.100]   for the natural language understanding.
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.860]   We were trying to turn the natural language--
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:10.700]   - Into computation.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.500]   - Into this computational language
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.340]   that we could then do things with.
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.020]   Now, similarly, when you imagine your alien, you say,
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.940]   "Okay, we're playing them the record.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.660]   "Did they understand it?"
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.060]   Well, depends what you mean.
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.180]   If they, you know, if we,
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.660]   if there's a representation that they have,
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.540]   if it converts to some representation where we can say,
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.340]   "Oh yes, that is a,
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.380]   "that's a representation that we can recognize
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.740]   "is represents understanding, then all well and good."
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.820]   But actually the only ones that I think we can say
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.460]   would represent understanding
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.420]   are ones that will then do things
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.660]   that we humans kind of recognize as being useful to us.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.340]   - Maybe trying to understand,
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.900]   quantify how technologically advanced
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.020]   this particular civilization is.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.820]   So are they a threat to us from a military perspective?
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.660]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.660]   - That's probably the kind of,
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.340]   first kind of understanding that I'll be interested in.
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.260]   - Gosh, that's so hard.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.100]   I mean, that's like in the Arrival movie,
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.820]   that was sort of one of the key questions is,
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.820]   you know, why are you here, so to speak?
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.660]   And it's--
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:12.740]   - Are you gonna hurt us?
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.660]   - Right, but even that is, you know, it's a very unclear,
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.620]   you know, it's like the, are you gonna hurt us?
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.340]   That comes back to a lot of interesting AI ethics questions
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.020]   because the, you know, we might make an AI that says,
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.620]   "Well, take autonomous cars, for instance,
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.900]   "you know, are you gonna hurt us?"
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.980]   Well, let's make sure you only drive
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.380]   at precisely the speed limit
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.500]   because we wanna make sure we don't hurt you, so to speak,
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.420]   because that's some, and then, well, something, you know,
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.740]   but you say, "But actually that means
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.300]   "I'm gonna be really late for this thing."
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.220]   And, you know, that sort of hurts me in some way.
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.380]   So it's hard to know, even the definition
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:50.380]   of what it means to hurt someone is unclear.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.380]   And as we start thinking about things about AI ethics
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.980]   and so on, that's, you know, something one has to address.
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.140]   - There's always trade-offs,
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.380]   and that's the annoying thing about ethics.
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.460]   - Yeah, well, right, and I mean, I think ethics,
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.340]   like these other things we're talking about,
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.060]   is a deeply human thing.
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.300]   There's no abstract, you know,
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.100]   let's write down the theorem
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.100]   that proves that this is ethically correct.
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.460]   That's a meaningless idea.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.600]   You know, you have to have a ground truth, so to speak,
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.980]   that's ultimately sort of what humans want,
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.900]   and they don't all want the same thing.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.140]   So that gives one all kinds of additional complexity
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.940]   in thinking about that.
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.580]   - One convenient thing in terms of turning ethics
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.340]   into computation, you can ask the question
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.740]   of what maximizes the likelihood
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.520]   of the survival of the species?
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.640]   - Yeah, that's a good existential issue.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.080]   But then when you say survival of the species, right,
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.200]   you might say, you might, for example,
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.360]   for example, let's say, forget about technology,
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.480]   just, you know, hang out and, you know, be happy,
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.960]   live our lives, go on to the next generation,
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.060]   you know, go through many, many generations
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.880]   where, in a sense, nothing is happening.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.720]   That okay?
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.560]   Is that not okay?
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.640]   Hard to know.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:09.440]   In terms of, you know, the attempt to do elaborate things
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.120]   and the attempt to might be counterproductive
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.680]   for the survival of the species.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.920]   Like for instance, I mean, in, you know,
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.340]   I think it's also a little bit hard to know,
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.640]   so okay, let's take that as a sort of thought experiment.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.480]   Okay?
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.200]   You know, you can say, well, what are the threats
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.760]   that we might have to survive?
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.820]   You know, the super volcano, the asteroid impact,
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.040]   the, you know, all these kinds of things.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.920]   Okay, so now we inventory these possible threats
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.120]   and we say, let's make our species as robust as possible
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.900]   relative to all these threats.
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:47.100]   I think in the end, it's a, it's sort of an unknowable thing
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.680]   what it takes to, you know, so given that
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.840]   you've got this AI and you've told it,
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.840]   maximize the long-term, what does long-term mean?
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.560]   Does long-term mean until the sun burns out?
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.680]   That's not gonna work.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.160]   You know, does long-term mean next thousand years?
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.780]   Okay, there are probably optimizations
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.280]   for the next thousand years that it's like,
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.480]   it's like if you're running a company,
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.280]   you can make a company be very stable
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.920]   for a certain period of time.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.920]   Like if, you know, if your company gets bought
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.400]   by some, you know, private investment group,
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.960]   then they'll, you know, you can run a company just fine
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.720]   for five years by just taking what it does
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.200]   and, you know, removing all R&D
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.600]   and the company will burn out after a while,
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.360]   but it'll run just fine for a little while.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.840]   So if you tell the AI, keep the humans okay
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.040]   for a thousand years, there's probably a certain set
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.960]   of things that one would do to optimize that,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.120]   many of which one might say, well,
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.240]   that would be a pretty big shame for the future of history,
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.200]   so to speak, for that to be what happens.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.960]   But I think, I think in the end, you know,
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.080]   as you start thinking about that question,
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:58.080]   it is what you realize is there's a whole sort of raft
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.240]   of undecidability, computational irreducibility.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.320]   In other words, it's, I mean, one of the good things
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:09.280]   about sort of the, what our civilization has gone through
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.560]   and what sort of we humans go through
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.060]   is that there's a certain computational irreducibility
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.400]   to it in the sense that it isn't the case
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.560]   that you can look from the outside and just say,
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.360]   the answer is gonna be this.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.520]   At the end of the day, this is what's gonna happen.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.240]   You actually have to go through the process to find out.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.960]   And I think that's both, that feels better in the sense
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.320]   it's not a, you know, something is achieved
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.640]   by going through all of this process.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:40.640]   And it's, but it also means that telling the AI,
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.160]   go figure out, you know, what will be the best outcome?
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.960]   Well, unfortunately, it's gonna come back and say,
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.320]   it's kind of undecidable what to do.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.320]   We'd have to run all of those scenarios to see what happens.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.280]   And if we want it for the infinite future,
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.640]   we're thrown immediately into sort of standard issues
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.140]   of kind of infinite computation and so on.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.840]   - So yeah, even if you get that the answer to the universe
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.040]   and everything is 42,
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.360]   you still have to actually run the universe.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.200]   - Yes.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.640]   - To figure out like the question, I guess,
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.720]   or the, you know, the journey is the point.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.600]   - Right, well, I think it's saying to summarize,
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.600]   this is the result of the universe.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.440]   - Yeah.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.800]   - That's, if that is possible, it tells us, I mean,
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.800]   the whole sort of structure of thinking about computation
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.000]   and so on, and thinking about how stuff works.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.960]   If it's possible to say, and the answer is such and such,
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.440]   you're basically saying there's a way
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.440]   of going outside the universe.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.920]   And you're kind of, you're getting yourself
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.880]   into something of a sort of paradox,
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.760]   because you're saying, if it's knowable, what the answer is,
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.420]   then there's a way to know it,
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.120]   that is beyond what the universe provides.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.240]   But if we can know it, then something that we're dealing
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.000]   with is beyond the universe.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.160]   So then the universe isn't the universe, so to speak.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.000]   So.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.160]   - And in general, as we'll talk about,
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.280]   at least for our small human brains,
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.880]   it's hard to show that the result
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.680]   of a sufficiently complex computation.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.280]   It's hard, I mean, it's probably impossible, right?
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.000]   Undecidability, so.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   And the universe appears, by at least the poets,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.360]   to be sufficiently complex that we won't be able
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.320]   to predict what the heck it's all going to.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.360]   - Well, we better not be able to,
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.880]   because if we can, it kind of denies,
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.720]   I mean, we're part of the universe.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.820]   So what does it mean for us to predict?
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.120]   It means that we, that our little part of the universe
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.560]   is able to jump ahead of the whole universe.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.520]   And this quickly winds up, I mean,
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.240]   it is conceivable, the only way we'd be able to predict
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.440]   is if we are so special in the universe,
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.600]   we are the one place where there is computation
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.260]   more special, more sophisticated than anything else
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.120]   that exists in the universe.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.560]   That's the only way we would have the ability to,
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.960]   sort of the almost theological ability, so to speak,
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.760]   to predict what happens in the universe,
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.800]   is to say somehow we're better
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.520]   than everything else in the universe,
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.880]   which I don't think is the case.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.280]   - Yeah, perhaps we can detect a large number
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.120]   of looping patterns that reoccur throughout the universe
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.560]   and fully describe them, and therefore,
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.120]   but then it still becomes exceptionally difficult
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.200]   to see how those patterns interact
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.040]   and what kind of complexity emerges.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.340]   - The most remarkable thing about the universe
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.520]   is that it has regularity at all.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.200]   Might not be the case.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.920]   - Does it have regularity?
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.320]   - Absolutely, it's full of, I mean, physics is successful.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.880]   You know, it's full of laws that tell us a lot of detail
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.200]   about how the universe works.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.280]   I mean, it could be the case that, you know,
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.960]   the 10 to the 90th particles in the universe,
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.200]   they all do their own thing, but they don't.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.120]   They all follow, we already know,
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.440]   they all follow basically the same physical laws,
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.960]   and that's something, that's a very profound fact
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.280]   about the universe.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.440]   What conclusion you draw from that is unclear.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.920]   I mean, in the early theologians,
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.180]   that was, you know, exhibit number one
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.320]   for the existence of God.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.160]   Now, you know, people have different conclusions about it,
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.520]   but the fact is, you know, right now,
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.200]   I mean, I happen to be interested, actually.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.100]   I've just restarted a long-running kind of interest of mine
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.220]   about fundamental physics.
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.500]   I'm kind of like, I'm on a bit of a quest,
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.560]   which I'm about to make more public
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.240]   to see if I can actually find
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.640]   the fundamental theory of physics.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.480]   - Excellent.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:46.240]   We'll come to that, and I just had a lot of conversations
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.280]   with quantum mechanics folks,
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.760]   so I'm really excited on your take,
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.000]   'cause I think you have a fascinating take
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.580]   on the fundamental nature of our reality
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.480]   from a physics perspective,
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.360]   and what might be underlying the kind of physics
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.760]   as we think of it today.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.800]   Okay, let's take a step back.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.440]   What is computation?
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.820]   - That's a good question.
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.180]   Operationally, computation is following rules.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.460]   That's kind of it.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.720]   I mean, computation is the result,
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.840]   is the process of systematically following rules,
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.880]   and it is the thing that happens when you do that.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.360]   - So taking initial conditions,
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.160]   or taking inputs and following rules,
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.960]   I mean, what are you following rules on?
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.640]   So there has to be some data, some--
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.460]   - Not necessarily.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.940]   It can be something where there's a very simple input,
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.760]   and then you're following these rules,
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.840]   and you'd say there's not really much data going into this.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.120]   You could actually pack the initial conditions
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.820]   into the rule if you want to.
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.120]   So I think the question is,
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.360]   is there a robust notion of computation?
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.000]   That is-- - What does robust mean?
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.680]   - What I mean by that is something like this.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.760]   So one of the things in another physics,
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.920]   something like energy, okay?
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.760]   There are different forms of energy,
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.520]   but somehow energy is a robust concept
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:13.520]   that isn't particular to kinetic energy,
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.040]   or nuclear energy, or whatever else.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.960]   There's a robust idea of energy.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.080]   So one of the things you might ask
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.100]   is there's the robust idea of computation,
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.160]   or does it matter that this computation
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.620]   is running in a Turing machine?
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:29.760]   This computation is running in a CMOS silicon CPU.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.080]   This computation is running in a fluid system
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.640]   in the weather, those kinds of things.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.280]   Or is there a robust idea of computation
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.200]   that transcends the sort of detailed framework
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.880]   that it's running in, okay?
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.240]   And-- - Is there?
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.300]   - Yes.
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.440]   I mean, it wasn't obvious that there was,
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.020]   so it's worth understanding the history
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.120]   and how we got to where we are right now,
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.160]   because to say that there is
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.860]   is a statement in part about our universe.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.000]   It's not a statement
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.320]   about what is mathematically conceivable.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.540]   It's about what actually can exist for us.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.040]   - Maybe you can also comment,
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.720]   because energy as a concept is robust,
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.140]   but there's also,
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:17.160]   it's intricate, complicated relationship with matter,
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.500]   with mass, is very interesting,
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.600]   of particles that carry force,
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.360]   and particles that sort of,
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.680]   particles that carry force and particles that have mass.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.920]   These kinds of ideas, they seem to map to each other,
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.920]   at least in the mathematical sense.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.300]   Is there a connection between energy and mass
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.120]   and computation, or are these completely disjoint ideas?
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.440]   - We don't know yet.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.240]   The things that I'm trying to do about fundamental physics
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.700]   may well lead to such a connection,
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.880]   but there is no known connection at this time.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.600]   - So can you elaborate a little bit more
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.360]   on how do you think about computation?
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.200]   What is computation?
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.400]   - Yeah, so I mean, let's tell a little bit
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.480]   of a historical story, okay?
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.540]   So, you know, go back 150 years,
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:14.200]   people were making mechanical calculators of various kinds.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.640]   And, you know, the typical thing was,
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.640]   you want an adding machine,
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.040]   you go to the adding machine store, basically.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.240]   You want a multiplying machine,
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.680]   you go to the multiplying machine store.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.680]   They're different pieces of hardware.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.580]   And so that means that,
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:28.040]   at least at the level of that kind of computation
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.080]   and those kinds of pieces of hardware,
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.200]   there isn't a robust notion of computation.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.220]   There's the adding machine kind of computation,
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.160]   there's the multiplying machine notion of computation,
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.560]   and they're disjoint.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.080]   So what happened in around 1900,
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.480]   people started imagining,
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.920]   particularly in the context of mathematical logic,
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.200]   could you have something
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.560]   which would represent any reasonable function, right?
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.600]   And they came up with things,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.920]   this idea of primitive recursion
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.520]   was one of the early ideas, and it didn't work.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.920]   There were reasonable functions
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.520]   that people could come up with
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.560]   that were not represented
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.560]   using the primitives of primitive recursion, okay?
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:09.200]   So then along comes 1931 and Godel's theorem and so on.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.400]   And as in looking back,
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.740]   one can see that as part of the process
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.960]   of establishing Godel's theorem,
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.120]   Godel basically showed how you could compile arithmetic,
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.640]   how you could basically compile logical statements,
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.800]   like this statement is unprovable, into arithmetic.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.880]   So what he essentially did was to show that arithmetic
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.200]   can be a computer in a sense
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.040]   that's capable of representing all kinds of other things.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.520]   And then Turing came along,
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.120]   1936 came up with Turing machines.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.520]   Meanwhile, Alonzo Church had come up with lambda calculus.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.920]   And the surprising thing that was established very quickly
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:51.180]   is the Turing machine idea about what computation might be
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.960]   is exactly the same as the lambda calculus idea
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.840]   of what computation might be.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.400]   And so, and then there started to be other ideas,
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.560]   register machines,
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.180]   other kinds of representations of computation.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.920]   And the big surprise was
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.760]   they all turned out to be equivalent.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.640]   So in other words, it might've been the case
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.240]   like those old adding machines and multiplying machines
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.460]   that Turing had his idea of computation,
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.380]   Church had his idea of computation,
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.000]   and they were just different, but it isn't true.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.200]   They're actually all equivalent.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:25.200]   So then by, I would say, the 1970s or so
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.480]   in sort of the computation,
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.840]   computer science computation theory area,
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:30.680]   people had sort of said,
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.920]   "Oh, Turing machines are kind of what computation is."
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.440]   Physicists were still holding out saying,
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.240]   "No, no, no, it's just not how the universe works.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.400]   We've got all these differential equations.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.920]   We've got all these real numbers
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.600]   that have infinite numbers of digits."
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.240]   - Yeah, the universe is not a Turing machine.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.080]   - Right.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.120]   The Turing machines are a small subset
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.520]   of the things that we make in microprocessors
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.500]   and engineering structures and so on.
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:58.080]   So probably, actually through my work in the 1980s
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.980]   about sort of the relationship between computation
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.120]   and models of physics,
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.760]   it became a little less clear that there would be,
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.960]   that there was this big sort of dichotomy
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.160]   between what can happen in physics
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.920]   and what happens in things like Turing machines.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:19.920]   And I think probably by now, people would mostly think,
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.480]   and by the way, brains were another kind of element
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.320]   of this.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.380]   Kurt Gödel didn't think that his notion of computation
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.580]   or what amounted to his notion of computation
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:30.260]   would cover brains.
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.580]   And Turing wasn't sure either.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.340]   But although he was a little bit,
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.300]   he got to be a little bit more convinced
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.840]   that it should cover brains.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.660]   But so, you know, I would say by probably sometime
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.700]   in the 1980s, there was beginning to be
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.620]   sort of a general belief that yes,
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.940]   this notion of computation that could be captured
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.120]   by things like Turing machines was reasonably robust.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.280]   Now, the next question is, okay,
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.680]   you can have a universal Turing machine
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.980]   that's capable of being programmed to do anything
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.600]   that any Turing machine can do.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.680]   And, you know, this idea of universal computation,
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.560]   it's an important idea,
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.120]   this idea that you can have one piece of hardware
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.960]   and program it with different pieces of software.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.440]   You know, that's kind of the idea
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.200]   that launched most modern technology.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.040]   I mean, that's kind of,
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.640]   that's the idea that launched computer revolution,
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.680]   software, et cetera.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.160]   So important idea.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.400]   But the thing that's still kind of holding out
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.880]   from that idea is, okay,
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.200]   there is this universal computation thing,
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.360]   but seems hard to get to.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.760]   Seems like you want to make a universal computer,
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.480]   you have to kind of have a microprocessor with, you know,
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.660]   a million gates in it,
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.440]   and you have to go to a lot of trouble
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.920]   to make something that achieves that level
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.040]   of computational sophistication.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.700]   Okay, so the surprise for me was that stuff
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.400]   that I discovered in the early '80s,
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.100]   looking at these things called cellular automata,
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:00.800]   which are really simple computational systems,
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.520]   the thing that was a big surprise to me was
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.160]   that even when their rules were very, very simple,
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.040]   they were doing things that were as sophisticated
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.640]   as they did when their rules were much more complicated.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.280]   So it didn't look like, you know,
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.240]   this idea, oh, to get sophisticated computation,
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.440]   you have to build something with very sophisticated rules.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.760]   That idea didn't seem to pan out.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.600]   And instead, it seemed to be the case
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.640]   that sophisticated computation was completely ubiquitous,
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.280]   even in systems with incredibly simple rules.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.320]   And so that led to this thing
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.920]   that I call the principle of computational equivalence,
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.960]   which basically says, when you have a system
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.240]   that follows rules of any kind,
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.480]   then whenever the system isn't doing things
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.200]   that are in some sense obviously simple,
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.840]   then the computation that the behavior
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.200]   of the system corresponds to
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.640]   is of equivalent sophistication.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.840]   So that means that when you kind of go
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.800]   from the very, very, very simplest things you can imagine,
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.000]   then quite quickly, you hit this kind of threshold
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.800]   above which everything is equivalent
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.840]   in its computational sophistication.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.480]   Not obvious that would be the case.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.880]   I mean, that's a science fact.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.960]   Well-- - No, no, no, no.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.360]   Hold on a second.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.160]   So this, you've opened with a new kind of science.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.880]   I mean, I remember it was a huge eye-opener
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:22.240]   that such simple things can create such complexity.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.040]   And yes, there's an equivalence, but it's not a fact.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.100]   It just appears to, I mean, as much as a fact
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:33.100]   as sort of these theories are so elegant
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:37.640]   that it seems to be the way things are.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.960]   But let me ask sort of, you just brought up previously
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.600]   kind of like the communities of computer scientists
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.000]   with their Turing machines,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.160]   the physicists with their universe,
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.680]   and whoever the heck, maybe neuroscientists
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.520]   looking at the brain.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.640]   What's your sense in the equivalence?
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.780]   So you've shown through your work
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:01.040]   that simple rules can create
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:07.080]   equivalently complex Turing machine systems, right?
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Is the universe equivalent to the kinds of,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.560]   to Turing machines?
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.880]   Is the human brain a kind of Turing machine?
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.740]   Do you see those things basically blending together?
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:25.200]   Or is there still a mystery about how disjoint they are?
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.980]   - Well, my guess is that they all blend together,
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.640]   but we don't know that for sure yet.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.260]   I mean, this, you know, I should say,
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.880]   I said rather glibly that the principle
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.200]   of computational equivalence is sort of a science fact.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:42.120]   And I was using air quotes for the science fact,
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.520]   because when you, it is a,
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.920]   I mean, just to talk about that for a second,
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.760]   and then we'll,
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:52.340]   the thing is that it is,
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.480]   it has a complicated epistemological character,
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.200]   similar to things like the second law of thermodynamics,
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.680]   law of entropy increase.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.120]   The, you know, what is the second law of thermodynamics?
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.700]   It is, is it a law of nature?
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.160]   Is it a thing that is true of the physical world?
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.700]   Is it something which is mathematically provable?
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.520]   Is it something which happens to be true
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.680]   of the systems that we see in the world?
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.720]   Is it in some sense, a definition of heat perhaps?
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.540]   Well, it's a combination of those things.
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.320]   And it's the same thing
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.320]   with the principle of computational equivalence.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.560]   And in some sense,
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.240]   the principle of computational equivalence
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.180]   is at the heart of the definition of computation,
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.040]   because it's telling you there is a thing,
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.920]   there is a robust notion
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.640]   that is equivalent across all these systems
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.000]   and doesn't depend on the details of each individual system.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.800]   And that's why we can meaningfully talk about
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.120]   a thing called computation.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.000]   And we're not stuck talking about,
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.240]   oh, there's computation in Turing machine number 3785,
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.840]   and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.560]   That's why there is a robust notion like that.
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:56.720]   Now, on the other hand,
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.200]   can we prove the principle of computational equivalence?
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.360]   Can we prove it as a mathematical result?
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.700]   Well, the answer is,
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.500]   actually we've got some nice results along those lines
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.880]   that say, throw me a random system with very simple rules.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.320]   Well, in a couple of cases,
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.120]   we now know that even the very simplest rules
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:20.000]   we can imagine of a certain type are universal
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.760]   and do sort of follow what you would expect
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.200]   from the principle of computational equivalence.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.000]   So that's a nice piece of sort of mathematical evidence
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.880]   for the principle of computational equivalence.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.600]   - Just to linger on that point,
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.600]   the simple rules creating sort of these complex behaviors,
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:41.400]   but is there a way to mathematically say
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.400]   that this behavior is complex?
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.060]   That you've mentioned that you cross a threshold.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:47.900]   - Right.
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.160]   So there are various indicators.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.800]   So for example, one thing would be,
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.860]   is it capable of universal computation?
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.880]   That is given the system,
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.040]   do there exist initial conditions for the system
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.880]   that can be set up to essentially represent programs
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.800]   to do anything you want, to compute primes,
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:06.440]   to compute pi, to do whatever you want, right?
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.960]   So that's an indicator.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.160]   So we know in a couple of examples that yes,
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:15.000]   the simplest candidates that could conceivably
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.260]   have that property do have that property.
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.100]   And that's what the principle
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:20.560]   of computational equivalence might suggest.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.920]   But this principle of computational equivalence,
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.940]   one question about it is,
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.320]   is it true for the physical world?
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.400]   It might be true for all these things we come up with,
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.300]   the Turing machines, the cellular automata, whatever else.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.920]   Is it true for our actual physical world?
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.340]   Is it true for the brains,
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:42.040]   which are an element of the physical world?
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.280]   We don't know for sure.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.000]   And that's not the type of question
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.380]   that we will have a definitive answer to,
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:51.120]   because there's a sort of scientific induction issue.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.620]   You can say, well, it's true for all these brains,
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.520]   but this person over here is really special
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.960]   and it's not true for them.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.560]   And you can't, you know,
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.520]   the only way that that cannot be what happens is
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.240]   if we finally nail it
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.320]   and actually get a fundamental theory for physics
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.240]   and it turns out to correspond to,
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.880]   let's say a simple program.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.360]   If that is the case,
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.400]   then we will basically have reduced physics
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.100]   to a branch of mathematics
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:17.960]   in the sense that we will not be,
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.720]   you know, right now with physics, we're like,
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.520]   well, this is the theory that, you know,
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.580]   this is the rules that apply here.
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.840]   But in the middle of that, you know,
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.000]   right by that black hole,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.640]   maybe these rules don't apply and something else applies.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.680]   And there may be another piece of the onion
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.200]   that we have to peel back.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.820]   But if we can get to the point where we actually have,
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.920]   this is the fundamental theory of physics,
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.640]   here it is, it's this program,
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.600]   run this program and you will get our universe.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.000]   Then we've kind of reduced the problem
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.260]   of figuring out things in physics
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.720]   to a problem of doing some,
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.000]   what turns out to be very difficult,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.160]   irreducibly difficult mathematical problems.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.280]   But it no longer is the case that we can say
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.920]   that somebody can come in and say,
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.000]   whoops, you know, you were right about all these things
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.400]   about Turing machines,
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.960]   but you're wrong about the physical universe.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.080]   We know there's sort of ground truth
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.960]   about what's happening in the physical universe.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.760]   Now, I happen to think,
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.740]   I mean, you asked me at an interesting time
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.340]   'cause I'm just in the middle of starting
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:19.520]   to re-energize my project
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.200]   to kind of study the fundamental theory of physics.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.880]   As of today, I'm very optimistic
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.480]   that we're actually gonna find something
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:28.800]   and that it's going to be possible
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.400]   to see that the universe really is computational
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.440]   in that sense.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.800]   But I don't know because we're betting against,
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.720]   we're betting against the universe, so to speak.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.920]   And I didn't, you know, it's not like,
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.720]   you know, when I spend a lot of my life building technology
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.120]   and then I know what's in there, right?
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.680]   And it's, there may be, it may have unexpected behavior,
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:48.840]   it may have bugs, things like that,
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.320]   but fundamentally I know what's in there.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.580]   For the universe, I'm not in that position, so to speak.
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:58.440]   - What kind of computation do you think
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:02.240]   the fundamental laws of physics might emerge from?
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:06.920]   So just to clarify, so you've done a lot of fascinating work
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.440]   with kind of discrete kinds of computation that,
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.120]   you know, you could sell your automata,
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.760]   and we'll talk about it,
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.160]   have this very clean structure.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.440]   It's such a nice way to demonstrate that simple rules
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.600]   can create immense complexity.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   But what, you know, is that actually,
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.480]   are cellular automata sufficiently general
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.040]   to describe the kinds of computation
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.680]   that might create the laws of physics?
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.880]   Just to give, can you give a sense of
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.880]   what kind of computation do you think
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.760]   would create the laws of physics?
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.680]   - So this is a slightly complicated issue
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.640]   because as soon as you have universal computation,
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.680]   you can in principle simulate anything with anything.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.120]   But it is not a natural thing to do.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.640]   And if you're asking,
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.660]   were you to try to find our physical universe
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.440]   by looking at possible programs
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.280]   in the computational universe of all possible programs,
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.320]   would the ones that correspond to our universe
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.360]   be small and simple enough that we might find them
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.640]   by searching that computational universe?
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.520]   We got to have the right basis, so to speak.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.840]   We have got to have the right language in effect
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.880]   for describing computation for that to be feasible.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.920]   So the thing that I've been interested in for a long time
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.480]   is what are the most structuralist structures
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.760]   that we can create with computation?
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.560]   So in other words, if you say a cellular automaton,
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.420]   it has a bunch of cells that are arrayed on a grid
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.080]   and it's very, you know, and every cell is updated
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.480]   in synchrony at a particular, you know,
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.440]   when there's a click of a clock, so to speak,
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.520]   and it goes, a tick of a clock,
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.040]   and every cell gets updated at the same time.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.480]   That's a very specific, very rigid kind of thing.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.920]   But my guess is that when we look at physics
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.120]   and we look at things like space and time,
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.440]   that what's underneath space and time
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.120]   is something as structureless as possible,
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:59.060]   that what we see, what emerges for us as physical space,
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.400]   for example, comes from something
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.980]   that is sort of arbitrarily unstructured underneath.
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.400]   And so I've been for a long time interested
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.240]   in kind of what are the most structuralist structures
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.680]   that we can set up?
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.880]   And actually what I had thought about for ages
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:18.600]   is using graphs, networks, where essentially,
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.100]   so let's talk about space, for example.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:22.880]   So what is space?
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.360]   Is a kind of a question one might ask.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.560]   Back in the early days of quantum mechanics, for example,
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.960]   people said, oh, for sure, space is gonna be discrete
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.800]   'cause all these other things we're finding are discrete,
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.880]   but that never worked out in physics.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.560]   And so space and physics today is always treated
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:40.920]   as this continuous thing, just like Euclid imagined it.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.080]   I mean, the very first thing Euclid says
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.640]   in his sort of common notions is,
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.720]   a point is something which has no part.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.360]   In other words, there are points that are arbitrarily small
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.820]   and there's a continuum of possible positions of points.
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.800]   And the question is, is that true?
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.520]   And so, for example, if we look at, I don't know,
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.500]   a fluid like air or water,
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.200]   we might say, oh, it's a continuous fluid.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.280]   We can pour it, we can do all kinds of things continuously.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.660]   But actually we know, 'cause we know the physics of it,
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:09.560]   that it consists of a bunch of discrete molecules
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.000]   bouncing around and only in the aggregate
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.440]   is it behaving like a continuum.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.680]   And so the possibility exists that that's true of space too.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.400]   People haven't managed to make that work
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.680]   with existing frameworks in physics,
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:25.560]   but I've been interested in whether one can imagine
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.800]   that underneath space and also underneath time
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.740]   is something more structureless.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:33.580]   And the question is, is it computational?
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.760]   So there are a couple of possibilities.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.920]   It could be computational,
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.440]   somehow fundamentally equivalent to a Turing machine,
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.440]   or it could be fundamentally not.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.880]   So how could it not be?
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.640]   It could not be, so a Turing machine
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.200]   essentially deals with integers, whole numbers,
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.540]   some level, and it can do things
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.100]   like it can add one to a number.
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.560]   It can do things like this.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.960]   - It can also store whatever the heck it did.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.480]   - Yes, it has an infinite storage.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.600]   But when one thinks about doing physics
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:06.620]   or sort of idealized physics or idealized mathematics,
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:08.480]   one can deal with real numbers,
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.720]   numbers with an infinite number of digits,
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.000]   numbers which are absolutely precise.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.720]   And one can say, we can take this number
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.400]   and we can multiply it by itself.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.200]   - Are you comfortable with infinity in this context?
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.200]   Are you comfortable in the context of computation?
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.440]   Do you think infinity plays a part?
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.760]   - I think that the role of infinity is complicated.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:30.920]   Infinity is useful in conceptualizing things.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:33.120]   It's not actualizable.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.760]   Almost by definition, it's not actualizable.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.800]   - But do you think infinity is part of the thing
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:40.440]   that might underlie the laws of physics?
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.360]   - I think that, no.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.720]   I think there are many questions that you ask about,
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.000]   you might ask about physics,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.500]   which inevitably involve infinity.
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:51.500]   Like when you say, is faster than light travel possible?
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:55.240]   You could say, given the laws of physics,
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.560]   can you make something even arbitrarily large,
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.780]   even, quote, infinitely large,
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:03.240]   that will make faster than light travel possible?
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.480]   Then you're thrown into dealing with infinity
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.640]   as a kind of theoretical question.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.800]   But I mean, talking about sort of
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.640]   what's underneath space and time
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:16.120]   and how one can make a computational infrastructure,
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.600]   one possibility is that you can't make
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.280]   a computational infrastructure
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:22.720]   in a Turing machine sense.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.640]   That you really have to be dealing with precise real numbers,
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.380]   you're dealing with partial differential equations,
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:30.640]   which have precise real numbers
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:32.640]   at arbitrarily closely separated points,
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.320]   you have a continuum for everything.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.160]   Could be that that's what happens,
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.760]   that there's sort of a continuum for everything
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.200]   and precise real numbers for everything,
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.120]   and then the things I'm thinking about are wrong.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.680]   And that's the risk you take
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.720]   if you're trying to sort of do things about nature,
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.120]   is you might just be wrong.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:55.080]   It's not, for me personally, it's kind of a strange thing,
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.540]   'cause I've spent a lot of my life building technology
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.620]   where you can do something that nobody cares about,
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:03.020]   but you can't be sort of wrong in that sense,
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.500]   in the sense you build your technology
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.900]   and it does what it does.
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:08.020]   But I think this question of what
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:11.140]   the sort of underlying computational infrastructure
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:12.460]   for the universe might be,
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:17.940]   so it's sort of inevitable it's gonna be fairly abstract,
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.860]   because if you're gonna get all these things
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.420]   like there are three dimensions of space,
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.900]   there are electrons, there are muons,
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.720]   there are quarks, there are this,
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:29.940]   you don't get to, if the model for the universe is simple,
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:31.960]   you don't get to have sort of a line of code
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:32.880]   for each of those things.
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:36.940]   You don't get to have sort of the muon case,
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.960]   the tau lepton case, and so on.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:39.960]   All of those things have to-- - Those all have to be
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:41.360]   emergent somehow. - Right.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.360]   - So something deeper. - Right.
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.100]   So that means it's sort of inevitable
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:46.880]   that it's a little hard to talk about
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.320]   what the sort of underlying structuralist structure
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.300]   actually is.
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:54.320]   Do you think human beings have the cognitive capacity
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.320]   to understand, if we're to discover it,
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:59.920]   to understand the kinds of simple structure
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.280]   from which these laws can emerge?
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.320]   Do you think that's a hopeless pursuit?
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:05.280]   - Well, here's what I think.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.700]   I think that, I mean, I'm right in the middle
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:08.540]   of this right now. - Right.
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:09.960]   - So I'm telling you that I-- - Do you think you'll
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.280]   hit a wall? - This human, yeah.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.200]   I mean, this human has a hard time understanding
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.480]   a bunch of the things that are going on.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.920]   But what happens in understanding is
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.160]   one builds waypoints.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.340]   I mean, if you said, understand modern
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:27.340]   21st century mathematics, starting from counting,
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:30.940]   back in whenever counting was invented 50,000 years ago,
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:33.020]   whatever it was, right?
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.580]   That would be really difficult.
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:36.660]   But what happens is we build waypoints
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:39.380]   that allow us to get to higher levels of understanding.
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.580]   And we see the same thing happening in language.
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:43.940]   You know, when we invent a word for something,
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:46.300]   it provides kind of a cognitive anchor,
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:48.340]   a kind of a waypoint that lets us,
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.660]   you know, like a podcast or something.
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:52.720]   You could be explaining, well, it's a thing
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.220]   which works this way, that way, the other way.
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.820]   But as soon as you have the word podcast
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.500]   and people kind of societally understand it,
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.460]   you start to be able to build on top of that.
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:04.580]   And so I think, and that's kind of the story
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:05.820]   of science actually too.
[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:08.860]   I mean, science is about building these kind of waypoints
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:12.280]   where we find this sort of cognitive mechanism
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:14.500]   for understanding something, then we can build on top of it.
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.820]   You know, we have the idea of, I don't know,
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:19.420]   differential equations, we can build on top of that.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:21.060]   We have this idea or that idea.
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:24.440]   So my hope is that if it is the case
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.700]   that we have to go all the way sort of from the sand
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.980]   to the computer and there's no waypoints in between,
[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:32.600]   then we're toast.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:33.980]   We won't be able to do that.
[00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:35.300]   - Well, eventually we might.
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:38.740]   So if we're, us clever apes are good enough
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.620]   for building those abstractions,
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:43.260]   eventually from sand we'll get to the computer, right?
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:44.860]   And it just might be a longer journey than--
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:46.580]   - The question is whether it is something
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:49.540]   that you asked whether our human brains
[00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:52.340]   will quote understand what's going on.
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.900]   And that's a different question because for that,
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:58.820]   it requires steps that are sort of
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:00.180]   from which we can construct
[00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:02.460]   a human understandable narrative.
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:06.860]   And that's something that I think I am somewhat hopeful
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.140]   that that will be possible.
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:12.160]   Although, you know, as of literally today, if you ask me,
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:15.500]   I'm confronted with things that I don't understand very well
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:16.540]   and--
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:18.860]   - So this is a small pattern in a computation
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:20.900]   trying to understand the rules
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:22.820]   under which the computation functions.
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:26.540]   And it's an interesting possibility
[00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:28.740]   under which kinds of computations
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:31.420]   such a creature can understand itself.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.660]   - My guess is that within,
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:36.300]   so we didn't talk much about computational irreducibility,
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.900]   but it's a consequence of this principle
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:39.460]   of computational equivalence.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:40.700]   And it's sort of a core idea
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:42.380]   that one has to understand, I think,
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:45.620]   which is question is you're doing a computation,
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:47.860]   you can figure out what happens in the computation
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:49.860]   just by running every step in the computation
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.500]   and seeing what happens.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:55.620]   Or you can say, let me jump ahead and figure out,
[00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.700]   you know, have something smarter that figures out
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:00.060]   what's gonna happen before it actually happens.
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:02.420]   And a lot of traditional science
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:06.300]   has been about that act of computational reducibility.
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.860]   It's like, we've got these equations
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:09.940]   and we can just solve them
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:11.180]   and we can figure out what's gonna happen.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.500]   We don't have to trace all of those steps.
[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:16.300]   We just jump ahead 'cause we solved these equations.
[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:18.540]   Okay, so one of the things that is a consequence
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:20.100]   of the principle of computational equivalence
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.020]   is you don't always get to do that.
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:25.300]   Many, many systems will be computationally irreducible
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.280]   in the sense that the only way to find out what they do
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.560]   is just follow each step and see what happens.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:30.400]   Why is that?
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.660]   Well, if you're saying, well, we, with our brains,
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:34.580]   we're a lot smarter.
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.300]   We don't have to mess around
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.020]   like the little cellular automaton
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:40.060]   going through and updating all those cells.
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:44.020]   We can just use the power of our brains to jump ahead.
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:46.900]   But if the principle of computational equivalence is right,
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:48.140]   that's not gonna be correct
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.380]   because it means that there's us
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:53.500]   doing our computation in our brains.
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:56.280]   There's a little cellular automaton doing its computation.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.660]   And the principle of computational equivalence says,
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:01.580]   these two computations are fundamentally equivalent.
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:03.360]   So that means we don't get to say,
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.140]   we're a lot smarter than the cellular automaton
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:07.940]   and jump ahead 'cause we're just doing computation
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:09.740]   that's of the same sophistication
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:11.740]   as the cellular automaton itself.
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.300]   - That's computational irreducibility.
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:14.140]   It's fascinating.
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:16.780]   And that's a really powerful idea.
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:21.700]   I think that's both depressing and humbling and so on,
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:24.340]   that we're all, we and the cellular automaton are the same.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.020]   But the question we're talking about,
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.060]   the fundamental laws of physics,
[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.140]   is kind of the reverse question.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.340]   You're not predicting what's gonna happen.
[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:34.280]   You have to run the universe for that.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.300]   But saying, can I understand
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.300]   what rules likely generated me?
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:39.180]   - I understand.
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:43.300]   But the problem is, to know whether you're right,
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:46.060]   you have to have some computational reducibility
[00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:48.060]   because we are embedded in the universe.
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:50.100]   If the only way to know whether we get the universe
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.940]   is just to run the universe, we don't get to do that
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:56.020]   'cause it just ran for 14.6 billion years or whatever.
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.700]   And we can't rerun it, so to speak.
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.060]   So we have to hope that there are pockets
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:04.140]   of computational reducibility sufficient
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:06.380]   to be able to say, yes, I can recognize
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:08.060]   those are electrons there.
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:10.780]   And I think that it's a feature
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.740]   of computational irreducibility.
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.060]   It's sort of a mathematical feature
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.780]   that there are always an infinite collection
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.840]   of pockets of reducibility.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.700]   The question of whether they land in the right place
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:21.500]   and whether we can sort of build a theory
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:23.140]   based on them is unclear.
[00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:25.900]   But to this point about whether we,
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:27.320]   as observers in the universe,
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.780]   built out of the same stuff as the universe,
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.660]   can figure out the universe, so to speak,
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:35.660]   that relies on these pockets of reducibility.
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:37.220]   Without the pockets of reducibility,
[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.300]   it won't work, can't work.
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:42.500]   But I think this question about how observers operate,
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.180]   it's one of the features of science
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:47.180]   over the last 100 years particularly,
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.780]   has been that every time we get more realistic
[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:53.180]   about observers, we learn a bit more about science.
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:55.820]   So for example, relativity was all about
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:59.100]   observers don't get to say when,
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.500]   what's simultaneous with what.
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:02.740]   They have to just wait for the light signal to arrive
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:04.860]   to decide what's simultaneous.
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:07.660]   Or for example, in thermodynamics,
[00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:09.500]   observers don't get to say the position
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:12.140]   of every single molecule in a gas.
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:14.460]   They can only see the kind of large scale features
[00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:16.780]   and that's why the second law of thermodynamics,
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.060]   law of entropy increase and so on works.
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.500]   If you could see every individual molecule,
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:25.740]   you wouldn't conclude something about thermodynamics.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:27.380]   You would conclude, oh, these molecules
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:28.780]   are just all doing these particular things.
[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:31.460]   You wouldn't be able to see this aggregate fact.
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:34.100]   So I strongly expect that,
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:36.500]   and in fact in the theories that I have,
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.940]   that one has to be more realistic
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:42.880]   about the computation and other aspects of observers
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.620]   in order to actually make a correspondence
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:46.620]   between what we experience.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:50.420]   In fact, my little team and I have a little theory
[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:52.860]   right now about how quantum mechanics may work,
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:56.380]   which is a very wonderfully bizarre idea
[00:58:56.380 --> 00:59:00.500]   about how the sort of thread of human consciousness
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:03.580]   relates to what we observe in the universe.
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:06.540]   But there's several steps to explain what that's about.
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:09.180]   - What do you make of the mess of the observer
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.740]   at the lower level of quantum mechanics?
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:16.740]   Sort of the textbook definition with quantum mechanics
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:20.580]   kind of says that there's two worlds.
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:23.980]   One is the world that actually is
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:25.940]   and the other is that's observed.
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:29.460]   What do you make sense of that kind of observing?
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:32.940]   - Well, I think actually the ideas we've recently had
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:36.620]   might actually give away into this.
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:40.220]   And that's, I don't know yet.
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:43.100]   I mean, I think that's, it's a mess.
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.580]   I mean, the fact is there is a,
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:47.660]   one of the things that's interesting
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.780]   and when people look at these models
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:52.420]   that I started talking about 30 years ago now,
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:55.020]   they say, "Oh no, that can't possibly be right.
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:56.700]   "What about quantum mechanics?"
[00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:59.500]   Right, you say, "Okay, tell me what is the essence
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.340]   "of quantum mechanics?
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.260]   "What do you want me to be able to reproduce
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:05.380]   "to know that I've got quantum mechanics, so to speak?"
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:07.180]   Well, and that question comes up,
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.580]   it comes up very operationally actually
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:09.740]   because we've been doing a bunch of stuff
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.180]   with quantum computing and there are all these companies
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:14.020]   that say, "We have a quantum computer."
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.060]   And we say, "Let's connect to your API
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.020]   "and let's actually run it."
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:21.300]   And they're like, "Well, maybe you shouldn't do that yet.
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:22.780]   "We're not quite ready yet."
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.180]   And one of the questions that I've been curious about is,
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:27.700]   "If I have five minutes with a quantum computer,
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.820]   "how can I tell if it's really a quantum computer
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:32.180]   "or whether it's a simulator at the other end?"
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.900]   Right, and turns out it's really hard.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:37.140]   It turns out there isn't, it's like a lot of these questions
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.780]   about sort of what is intelligence, what's life.
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:42.060]   - That's a Turing test for quantum computing.
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.100]   - That's right, that's right.
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.500]   It's like, are you really a quantum computer?
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.580]   And I think-- - Or just a simulation, yeah.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.420]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:51.140]   Is it just a simulation or is it really a quantum computer?
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.060]   - Yeah, same issue all over again.
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:56.820]   But that, so, you know, this whole issue
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:59.220]   about the sort of mathematical structure
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:03.620]   of quantum mechanics and the completely separate thing
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:06.220]   that is our experience in which we think
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.620]   definite things happen, whereas quantum mechanics
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.600]   doesn't say definite things ever happen.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.460]   Quantum mechanics is all about the amplitudes
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.080]   for different things to happen.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.580]   But yet our thread of consciousness operates
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.420]   as if definite things are happening.
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:24.700]   - But to linger on the point, you've kind of mentioned
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:28.700]   the structure that could underlie everything
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.900]   and this idea that it could perhaps have something
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:33.700]   like a structure of a graph.
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:36.680]   Can you elaborate why your intuition is
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.380]   that there's a graph structure of nodes and edges
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:41.300]   and what it might represent?
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.940]   - Right, okay, so the question is,
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:47.340]   what is, in a sense, the most structureless structure
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:49.380]   you can imagine, right?
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:54.220]   So, and in fact, what I've recently realized
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:57.020]   in the last year or so, I have a new
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.540]   most structureless structure.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:01.260]   - By the way, the question itself is a beautiful one
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.700]   and a powerful one in itself.
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.180]   So even without an answer, just the question
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.660]   is a really strong question.
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:07.500]   - Right, right.
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.100]   - But what's your new idea?
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.020]   - Well, it has to do with hypergraphs.
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:16.020]   Essentially, what is interesting about the sort of model
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:19.940]   I have now is it's a little bit like what happened
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.180]   with computation.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.540]   Everything that I think of as, oh, well,
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:27.500]   maybe the model is this, I discover it's equivalent.
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.580]   And that's quite encouraging because it's like,
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.500]   I could say, well, I'm gonna look at trivalent graphs
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.700]   with three edges for each node and so on.
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:37.780]   Or I could look at this special kind of graph.
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:41.060]   Or I could look at this kind of algebraic structure.
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:44.380]   And turns out that the things I'm now looking at,
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:47.700]   everything that I've imagined that is a plausible type
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.860]   of structureless structure is equivalent to this.
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:52.140]   So what is it?
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.860]   Well, a typical way to think about it is,
[01:02:54.860 --> 01:03:01.300]   well, so you might have some collection of tuples,
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:07.380]   collection of, let's say numbers.
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:12.380]   So you might have one, three, five, two, three, four,
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.500]   little, just collections of numbers,
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.740]   triples of numbers, let's say, quadruples of numbers,
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.620]   pairs of numbers, whatever.
[01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:24.060]   And you have all these sort of floating little tuples.
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.060]   They're not in any particular order.
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:30.820]   And that sort of floating collection of tuples,
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.860]   and I told you this was abstract,
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:34.940]   represents the whole universe.
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:38.980]   The only thing that relates them is when a symbol
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:41.860]   is the same, it's the same, so to speak.
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:45.540]   So if you have two tuples and they contain the same symbol,
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:47.100]   let's say at the same position of the tuple,
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:48.580]   the first element of the tuple,
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:50.900]   then that represents a relation.
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:53.900]   Okay, so let me try and peel this back.
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:54.980]   - Wow, okay.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:56.900]   (laughing)
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:59.820]   - I told you it's abstract, but this is the--
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.380]   - So the relationship is formed by the same,
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.820]   some aspect of sameness.
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:06.700]   - Right, but so think about it in terms of a graph.
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:09.620]   So a graph, a bunch of nodes,
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:12.380]   let's say you number each node, okay?
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.540]   Then what is a graph?
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:17.700]   A graph is a set of pairs that say this node has an edge
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.780]   connecting it to this other node.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:23.980]   So that's the, and a graph is just a collection
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.060]   of those pairs that say this node
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:28.580]   connects to this other node.
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:31.060]   So this is a generalization of that,
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:32.980]   in which instead of having pairs,
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:35.040]   you have arbitrary and tuples.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:38.860]   That's it, that's the whole story.
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:40.340]   And now the question is, okay,
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:43.660]   so that might represent the state of the universe.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:45.020]   How does the universe evolve?
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:46.540]   What does the universe do?
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:49.180]   And so the answer is that what I'm looking at
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:53.200]   is transformation rules on these hypergraphs.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.900]   In other words, you say this,
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:05:00.420]   whenever you see a piece of this hypergraph
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.340]   that looks like this,
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:05.240]   turn it into a piece of a hypergraph that looks like this.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:08.140]   So on a graph, it might be, when you see the subgraph,
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:10.140]   when you see this thing with a bunch of edges hanging out
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.620]   in this particular way,
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:15.380]   then rewrite it as this other graph, okay?
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:17.580]   And so that's the whole story.
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:21.580]   So the question is, what, so now you say,
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:25.220]   I mean, as I say, this is quite abstract.
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.740]   And one of the questions is,
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:29.560]   where do you do those updating?
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.060]   So you've got this giant graph.
[01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:32.420]   - What triggers the updating?
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:35.200]   Like what's the ripple effect of it?
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.580]   Is it?
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:37.420]   - Yeah.
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:40.860]   I suspect everything's discrete, even in time.
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:42.000]   So.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.140]   - Okay, so the question is, where do you do the updates?
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:44.980]   - Yes.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:46.060]   - And the answer is, the rule is,
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:48.040]   you do them wherever they apply.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.580]   And you do them, the order in which the updates is done
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.060]   is not defined.
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:54.820]   That is, you can do them,
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.220]   so there may be many possible orderings for these updates.
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.220]   Now, the point is,
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:02.060]   imagine you're an observer in this universe.
[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:05.300]   So, and you say, did something get updated?
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:07.620]   Well, you don't in any sense know
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:09.840]   until you yourself have been updated.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.660]   - Right.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:14.960]   - So in fact, all that you can be sensitive to
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.180]   is essentially the causal network
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:22.180]   of how an event over there affects an event that's in you.
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:25.140]   - That doesn't even feel like observation.
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:26.700]   That's like, that's something else.
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.260]   You're just part of the whole thing.
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:30.740]   - Yes, you're part of it, but even to have,
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:34.480]   so the end result of that is all you're sensitive to
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.980]   is this causal network of what event affects
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:38.620]   what other event.
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.460]   I'm not making a big statement
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:42.940]   about sort of the structure of the observer.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:45.300]   I'm simply saying, I'm simply making the argument
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:49.860]   that what happens, the microscopic order of these rewrites
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:53.020]   is not something that any observer,
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:55.620]   any conceivable observer in this universe
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.300]   can be affected by.
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:00.440]   Because the only thing the observer can be affected by
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:04.220]   is this causal network of how the events
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:07.140]   in the observer are affected by other events
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.100]   that happen in the universe.
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.340]   So the only thing you have to look at
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:10.640]   is the causal network.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.600]   You don't really have to look at this microscopic rewriting
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.440]   that's happening.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:17.180]   So these rewrites are happening wherever they,
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:18.680]   they happen wherever they feel like.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.860]   - Causal network, is there,
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:23.940]   you said that there's not really,
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:26.620]   so the idea would be an undefined,
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:30.400]   like what gets updated, the sequence of things is undefined.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.700]   - Yes.
[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:34.460]   - Is that's what you mean by the causal network,
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:35.300]   but then the--
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:38.560]   - No, the causal network is given that an update has happened
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:39.920]   that's an event.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.620]   Then the question is, is that event causally related to?
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:46.420]   Does that event, if that event didn't happen,
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.860]   then some future event couldn't happen yet.
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:49.700]   - Gotcha.
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:53.060]   - And so you build up this network of what affects what.
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:53.900]   Okay?
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:57.500]   And so what that does, so when you build up that network,
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.380]   that's kind of the observable aspect of the universe
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:01.220]   in some sense.
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:02.060]   - Gotcha.
[01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:04.820]   - And so then you can ask questions about, you know,
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:07.860]   how robust is that observable network
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:09.780]   of what's happening in the universe.
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:12.640]   Okay, so here's where it starts getting kind of interesting.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.380]   So for certain kinds of microscopic rewriting rules,
[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:18.820]   the order of rewrites does not matter
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:20.320]   to the causal network.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:24.100]   And so this is, okay, mathematical logic moment,
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.380]   this is equivalent to the Church-Rosser property
[01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:28.740]   or the confluence property of rewrite rules.
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:31.020]   And it's the same reason that if you're simplifying
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.140]   an algebraic expression, for example,
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:35.500]   you can say, oh, let me expand those terms out,
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.140]   let me factor those pieces.
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:38.980]   Doesn't matter what order you do that in,
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:40.680]   you'll always get the same answer.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.760]   And that's, it's the same fundamental phenomenon
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:47.580]   that causes for certain kinds of microscopic rewrite rules
[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:50.860]   that causes the causal network to be independent
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:53.620]   of the microscopic order of rewritings.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.820]   - Why is that property important?
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:57.820]   - 'Cause it implies special relativity.
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:03.820]   I mean, the reason it's important is that that property,
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:09.780]   special relativity says you can look at these sort of,
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:11.880]   you can look at different reference frames.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.600]   You can have different, you can be looking at your notion
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.580]   of what space and what's time can be different,
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.520]   depending on whether you're traveling at a certain speed,
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.900]   depending on whether you're doing this, that, and the other.
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:24.020]   But nevertheless, the laws of physics are the same.
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.940]   That's what the principle of special relativity says,
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.280]   is the laws of physics are the same
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.260]   independent of your reference frame.
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:34.700]   Well, turns out this sort of change
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.900]   of the microscopic rewriting order
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.140]   is essentially equivalent to a change of reference frame,
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.740]   or at least there's a sub part of how that works
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.660]   that's equivalent to change of reference frame.
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:47.100]   So, somewhat surprisingly, and sort of for the first time
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:50.100]   in forever, it's possible for an underlying
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:53.460]   microscopic theory to imply special relativity,
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:54.560]   to be able to derive it.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.980]   It's not something you put in as a,
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:00.340]   this is a, it's something where this other property,
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:03.640]   causal invariance, which is also the property
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:06.120]   that implies that there's a single thread of time
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.480]   in the universe.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.820]   It might not be the case.
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:13.340]   That's what would lead to the possibility
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:16.760]   of an observer thinking that definite stuff happens.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.240]   Otherwise, you've got all these possible rewriting orders,
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.320]   and who's to say which one occurred.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.720]   But with this causal invariance property,
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.480]   there's a notion of a definite thread of time.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.920]   - It sounds like that kind of idea of time,
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.000]   even space, would be emergent from the system.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:31.840]   - Oh yeah.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.520]   - So it's not a fundamental part of the system.
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.520]   - No, no, at a fundamental level,
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.280]   all you've got is a bunch of nodes connected
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.160]   by hyper edges or whatever.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.840]   - So there's no time, there's no space.
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:42.080]   - That's right.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.840]   But the thing is that it's just like imagining,
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.920]   imagine you're just dealing with a graph,
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.880]   and imagine you have something like a honeycomb graph,
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:51.860]   where you have a bunch of hexagons.
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:54.920]   That graph, at a microscopic level,
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.240]   it's just a bunch of nodes connected to other nodes.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.520]   But at a macroscopic level,
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:02.240]   you say that looks like a honeycomb, you know, lattice.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.600]   It looks like a two-dimensional, you know,
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:05.960]   manifold of some kind.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.840]   It looks like a two-dimensional thing.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:08.920]   If you connect it differently,
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:11.620]   if you just connect all the nodes one to another,
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:14.060]   and kind of a sort of linked list type structure,
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:14.900]   then you'd say, well,
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:17.280]   that looks like a one-dimensional space.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:18.800]   But at the microscopic level,
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.000]   all these are just networks with nodes.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.460]   The macroscopic level,
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:24.200]   they look like something that's like
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.760]   one of our sort of familiar kinds of space.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.360]   And it's the same thing with these hypergraphs.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.140]   Now, if you ask me, have I found one
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:32.800]   that gives me three-dimensional space,
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.440]   the answer is not yet.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.920]   So we don't know, you know, this is one of these things,
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.600]   we're kind of betting against nature, so to speak.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.320]   And I have no way to know.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:45.000]   And so there are many other properties of this kind of system
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.160]   that have a very beautiful, actually, and very suggestive.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.600]   And it will be very elegant if this turns out to be right,
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.280]   because it's very clean.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.920]   I mean, you start with nothing,
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:56.440]   and everything gets built up.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:59.200]   Everything about space, everything about time,
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.420]   everything about matter, it's all just emergent
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:05.600]   from the properties of this extremely low-level system.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.440]   And that will be pretty cool
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.600]   if that's the way our universe works.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.960]   Now, do I, on the other hand,
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.960]   the thing that I find very confusing is,
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.520]   let's say we succeed.
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:20.320]   Let's say we can say this particular
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:25.360]   sort of hypergraph rewriting rule gives the universe.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.400]   Just run that hypergraph rewriting rule for enough times,
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.240]   and you'll get everything.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:30.920]   You'll get this conversation we're having.
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.000]   You'll get everything.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.520]   It's that,
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.840]   if we get to that point,
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.280]   and we look at what is this thing,
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.320]   what is this rule that we just have
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.680]   that is giving us our whole universe?
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:45.760]   How do we think about that thing?
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.280]   Let's say, turns out the minimal version of this,
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.920]   and this is kind of cool thing
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.620]   for a language designer like me,
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:53.600]   the minimal version of this model
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.560]   is actually a single line of orphan language code.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:59.320]   So that's, which I wasn't sure was gonna happen that way,
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:03.560]   but it's, that's, it's kind of, no.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.760]   We don't know what, we don't know what,
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.720]   that's just the framework.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.280]   To know the actual particular hypergraph,
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.880]   it might be a longer,
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.760]   the specification of the rules might be slightly longer.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:18.080]   - How does that help you accept marveling in the beauty
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:21.240]   and the elegance of the simplicity that creates the universe?
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.380]   That does that help us predict anything?
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.540]   Not really, because of the irreducibility.
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:27.060]   - That's correct, that's correct.
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:29.400]   But so, the thing that is really strange to me,
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:32.760]   and I haven't wrapped my brain around this yet,
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:35.580]   is, you know, one is,
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:38.620]   one keeps on realizing that we're not special,
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:40.300]   in the sense that, you know,
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:41.940]   we don't live at the center of the universe,
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:43.500]   we don't blah, blah, blah,
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:48.100]   and yet, if we produce a rule for the universe,
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.460]   and it's quite simple,
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:52.900]   and we can write it down in a couple of lines or something,
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.620]   that feels very special.
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:57.780]   How do we come to get a simple universe,
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:00.620]   when many of the available universes, so to speak,
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:02.140]   are incredibly complicated?
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:05.460]   Might be, you know, a quintillion characters long.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.660]   Why did we get one of the ones that's simple?
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:10.900]   And so, I haven't wrapped my brain around that issue yet.
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:14.100]   - If indeed, we are in such a simple,
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:16.220]   the universe is such a simple rule,
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:20.380]   is it possible that there is something outside of this,
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.980]   that we are in a kind of what people call,
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:25.100]   so the simulation, right?
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:26.780]   That we're just part of a computation
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:29.580]   that's being explored by a graduate student
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:31.340]   in an alternate universe?
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:33.300]   - Well, you know, the problem is,
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:35.820]   we don't get to say much about what's outside our universe,
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:36.820]   because by definition,
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:39.700]   our universe is what we exist within.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:43.740]   Now, can we make a sort of almost theological conclusion,
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.420]   from being able to know how our particular universe works?
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:48.860]   Interesting question.
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:52.180]   I don't think that, if you ask the question,
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.700]   could we, and it relates again to this question
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.220]   about the extraterrestrial intelligence,
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:59.660]   you know, we've got the rule for the universe.
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:01.780]   Was it built in on purpose?
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:02.860]   Hard to say.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:04.380]   That's the same thing as saying,
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:06.660]   we see a signal from, you know,
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.480]   that we're, you know, receiving from some,
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.340]   you know, random star somewhere.
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.820]   And it's a series of pulses.
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:16.900]   And, you know, it's a periodic series of pulses, let's say.
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.120]   Was that done on purpose?
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.900]   Can we conclude something about the origin
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:21.340]   of that series of pulses?
[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:22.940]   - Just because it's elegant,
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:27.520]   does not necessarily mean that somebody created it,
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.340]   or that we can even comprehend what would create it.
[01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:32.620]   - Yeah, I mean, I think it's the ultimate version
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:35.140]   of the sort of identification
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:37.580]   of the techno-signature question.
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:38.620]   It's the ultimate version of that,
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.940]   is was our universe a piece of technology, so to speak?
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:43.700]   And how on earth would we know?
[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:47.260]   Because, but I mean, it'll be, it's, I mean, you know,
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:49.140]   in the kind of crazy science fiction thing
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:50.980]   you could imagine, you could say,
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.060]   oh, somebody's going to have, you know,
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:54.300]   there's going to be a signature there.
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:57.060]   It's going to be, you know, made by so-and-so.
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:00.180]   But there's no way we could understand that, so to speak.
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.900]   And it's not clear what that would mean,
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:06.500]   because the universe simply, you know, this,
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:09.660]   if we find a rule for the universe, we're not,
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:11.060]   we're simply saying that rule
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:13.740]   represents what our universe does.
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:15.780]   We're not saying that that rule
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.900]   is something running on a big computer
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:19.220]   and making our universe.
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:22.300]   It's just saying that represents what our universe does,
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.780]   in the same sense that, you know,
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:26.380]   laws of classical mechanics, differential equations,
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:30.040]   whatever they are, represent what mechanical systems do.
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:32.520]   It's not that the mechanical systems
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.160]   are somehow running solutions
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.900]   to those differential equations.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:37.100]   Those differential equations
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.340]   just representing the behavior of those systems.
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:42.700]   - So what's the gap in your sense to linger
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:45.820]   on the fascinating, perhaps slightly sci-fi question?
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:49.740]   What's the gap between understanding the fundamental rules
[01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:53.680]   that create a universe and engineering a system,
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.820]   actually creating a simulation ourselves?
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:58.140]   So you've talked about sort of,
[01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:01.500]   you've talked about, you know, nanoengineering,
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.100]   kind of ideas that are kind of exciting,
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:05.540]   actually creating some ideas of computation
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:06.740]   in the physical space.
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:09.460]   How hard is it as an engineering problem
[01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:10.460]   to create the universe,
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:12.540]   once you know the rules that create it?
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:13.940]   - Well, that's an interesting question.
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:17.460]   I think the substrate on which the universe is operating
[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.700]   is not a substrate that we have access to.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.700]   I mean, the only substrate we have
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:24.980]   is that same substrate that the universe is operating in.
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:28.320]   So if the universe is a bunch of hypergraphs being rewritten,
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.460]   then we get to attach ourselves
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:33.000]   to those same hypergraphs being rewritten.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.240]   We don't get to, and if you ask the question,
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.240]   you know, is the code clean?
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.640]   You know, can we write nice, elegant code
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:43.640]   with efficient algorithms and so on?
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:46.480]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.480]   How, you know, that's this question
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.320]   of how much computational reducibility
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.640]   there is in the system.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.960]   - But so I've seen some beautiful cellular automata
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:57.120]   that basically create copies of itself within itself, right?
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:00.600]   So that's the question, whether it's possible to create,
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.840]   like whether you need to understand the substrate
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.560]   or whether you can just--
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.400]   - Yeah, well, right.
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:07.600]   I mean, so one of the things that is sort of
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.640]   one of my slightly sci-fi thoughts about the future,
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:13.280]   so to speak, is, you know, right now,
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.360]   if you poll typical people, you say,
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.400]   do you think it's important to find
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.600]   the fundamental theory of physics?
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:22.360]   You get, because I've done this poll, informally at least,
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:24.920]   it's curious, actually, you get a decent fraction
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.880]   of people saying, oh yeah, that would be pretty interesting.
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:31.400]   - I think that's becoming, surprisingly enough, more,
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:36.120]   I mean, a lot of people are interested in physics
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:37.960]   in a way that, like without understanding it,
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:42.160]   just kind of watching scientists,
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:44.880]   a very small number of them, struggle to understand
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.200]   the nature of our reality.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.440]   - Right, I mean, I think that's somewhat true,
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.720]   and in fact, in this project that I'm launching into
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:54.240]   to try and find the fundamental theory of physics,
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.080]   I'm going to do it as a very public project.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.840]   I mean, it's gonna be live-streamed
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.600]   and all this kind of stuff, and I don't know
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.560]   what will happen, it'll be kind of fun.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:04.520]   I mean, I think that it's the interface
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:07.120]   to the world of this project.
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:11.560]   I mean, I figure one feature of this project is,
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:15.000]   unlike technology projects that basically are what they are,
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.960]   this is a project that might simply fail,
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.520]   because it might be the case that it generates
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.240]   all kinds of elegant mathematics,
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.460]   but it has absolutely nothing to do
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:23.920]   with the physical universe that we happen to live in.
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:27.560]   Well, okay, so we're talking about kind of the quest
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.960]   to find the fundamental theory of physics.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:33.000]   First point is, you know, it's turned out
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.120]   it's kind of hard to find the fundamental theory of physics.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.480]   People weren't sure that that would be the case.
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.760]   Back in the early days of applying mathematics to science,
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.920]   1600s and so on, people were like,
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:46.800]   oh, in 100 years we'll know everything there is to know
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.000]   about how the universe works.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.560]   Turned out to be harder than that,
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:51.840]   and people got kind of humble at some level,
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:54.040]   'cause every time we got to sort of a greater level
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.120]   of smallness in studying the universe,
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.120]   it seemed like the math got more complicated
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.960]   and everything got harder.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:04.760]   When I was a kid, basically,
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.640]   I started doing particle physics,
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.840]   and when I was doing particle physics,
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.400]   I always thought finding the fundamental,
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.160]   fundamental theory of physics,
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.280]   that's a kooky business, we'll never be able to do that.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.560]   But we can operate within these frameworks
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.480]   that we built for doing quantum field theory
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.520]   and general relativity and things like this,
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:26.440]   and it's all good and we can figure out a lot of stuff.
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:28.080]   - Did you even at that time have a sense
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.520]   that there's something behind that too?
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.440]   - Sure, I just didn't expect that.
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:35.840]   I thought in some rather un,
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:38.600]   it's actually kind of crazy thinking back on it,
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.560]   because it's kind of like there was this long period
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.400]   in civilization where people thought the ancients
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.040]   had it all figured out and will never figure out
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.280]   anything new.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:49.520]   And to some extent, that's the way I felt about physics
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:52.040]   when I was in the middle of doing it, so to speak.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.640]   We've got quantum field theory,
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.640]   it's the foundation of what we're doing,
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:59.920]   and yes, there's probably something underneath this,
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.800]   but we'll sort of never figure it out.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:06.000]   But then I started studying simple programs
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.760]   in the computational universe,
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.960]   things like cellular automata and so on,
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.400]   and I discovered that they do all kinds of things
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.800]   that were completely at odds with the intuition
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.000]   that I had had.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.800]   And so after that, after you see this tiny little program
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:23.360]   that does all this amazingly complicated stuff,
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:26.320]   then you start feeling a bit more ambitious about physics
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.080]   and saying, maybe we could do this for physics too.
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:32.840]   And so that got me started years ago now
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:37.240]   in this kind of idea of could we actually find
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.520]   what's underneath all of these frameworks
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.280]   like quantum field theory and general relativity and so on.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.560]   And people perhaps don't realize as clearly as they might
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.740]   that the frameworks we're using for physics,
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.040]   which is basically these two things,
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:52.600]   quantum field theory, sort of the theory of small stuff
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.800]   and general relativity, theory of gravitation
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.460]   and large stuff, those are the two basic theories
[01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:58.880]   and they're 100 years old.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:01.320]   I mean, general relativity was 1915,
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:04.120]   quantum field theory, well, 1920s.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.000]   So basically 100 years old.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.820]   And it's been a good run.
[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.760]   There's a lot of stuff been figured out.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:14.720]   But what's interesting is the foundations haven't changed
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.400]   in all that period of time,
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.800]   even though the foundations had changed several times
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.500]   before that in the 200 years earlier than that.
[01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:25.380]   And I think the kinds of things that I'm thinking about,
[01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:26.720]   which are sort of really informed
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.240]   by thinking about computation
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:29.920]   and the computational universe,
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.520]   it's a different foundation.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:35.440]   It's a different set of foundations and might be wrong,
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:38.700]   but it is at least, we have a shot.
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:41.540]   And I think it's, to me, it's,
[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.040]   my personal calculation for myself is,
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:48.840]   if it turns out that the finding
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:50.180]   the fundamental theory of physics,
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.620]   it's kind of low hanging fruit, so to speak,
[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:55.440]   it'd be a shame if we just didn't think to do it.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:58.720]   If people just said, oh, you'll never figure that stuff out.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.280]   And it takes another 200 years
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.900]   before anybody gets around to doing it.
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:08.560]   I think it's, I don't know how low hanging
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.580]   this fruit actually is.
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:13.860]   It may be that it's kind of the wrong century
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:14.840]   to do this project.
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:18.520]   I mean, I think the cautionary tale for me,
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:21.580]   I think about things that I've tried to do in technology
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:25.200]   where people thought about doing them a lot earlier.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:27.600]   My favorite example is probably Leibniz
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:30.580]   who thought about making essentially,
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:32.240]   encapsulating the world's knowledge
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:36.240]   in a computational form in the late 1600s
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.640]   and did a lot of things towards that.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:41.720]   And basically, we finally managed to do this,
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.600]   but he was 300 years too early.
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:47.120]   And that's kind of the, in terms of life planning,
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.700]   it's kind of like avoid things that can't be done
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:52.080]   in your century, so to speak.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:55.240]   - Yeah, timing is everything.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:59.520]   So you think if we kind of figure out
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:02.280]   the underlying rules it can create
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:04.400]   from which quantum field theory
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.560]   and general relativity can emerge,
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.160]   do you think that'll help us unify it
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.320]   at that level of abstraction?
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.440]   - Oh, we'll know it completely.
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.100]   We'll know how that all fits together.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.840]   Yes, without a question.
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:18.840]   And I mean, it's already, even the things I've already done,
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:23.020]   they're very, you know, it's very elegant actually,
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:24.960]   how things seem to be fitting together.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.080]   Now, you know, is it right?
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.000]   I don't know yet.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.340]   It's awfully suggestive.
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:31.560]   If it isn't right, it's,
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.760]   then the designer of the universe
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.160]   should feel embarrassed, so to speak,
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.960]   'cause it's a really good way to do it.
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:39.640]   - In your intuition, in terms of design universe,
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.440]   does God play dice?
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:44.360]   Is there randomness in this thing,
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:46.240]   or is it deterministic?
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.080]   So the kind of graph--
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.840]   - That's a little bit of a complicated question,
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:51.240]   because when you're dealing with these things
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:53.800]   that involve these rewrites that have, okay.
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:56.280]   - Even randomness is an emergent phenomenon perhaps?
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:57.360]   - Yes, yes.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.240]   I mean, it's a, yeah, well, randomness,
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:01.360]   in many of these systems,
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.880]   pseudo-randomness and randomness are hard to distinguish.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.200]   In this particular case,
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.880]   the current idea that we have
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:10.960]   about measurement in quantum mechanics,
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.000]   is something very bizarre and very abstract,
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.160]   and I don't think I can yet explain it
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:21.400]   without kind of yakking about very technical things.
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.600]   Eventually I will be able to,
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:25.960]   but if that's right,
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.720]   it's kind of a, it's a weird thing,
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:32.260]   because it slices between determinism and randomness
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:35.180]   in a weird way that hasn't been sliced before, so to speak.
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:38.160]   So like many of these questions that come up in science,
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:40.680]   where it's like, is it this or is it that?
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:43.080]   Turns out the real answer is it's neither of those things.
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:44.600]   It's something kind of different
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.920]   and sort of orthogonal to those categories.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.080]   And so that's the current, you know,
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:54.160]   this week's idea about how that might work.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:58.800]   But, you know, we'll see how that unfolds.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.200]   I mean, there's this question about a field like physics
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:05.440]   and sort of the quest for fundamental theory and so on,
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:07.900]   and there's both the science of what happens
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:11.440]   and there's the sort of the social aspect of what happens,
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.680]   because, you know, in a field
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.520]   that is basically as old as physics,
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.960]   we're at, I don't know what it is, fourth generation,
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:19.880]   I don't know, fifth generation,
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:22.560]   I don't know what generation it is of physicists.
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.600]   And like, I was one of these, so to speak,
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:27.960]   and for me, the foundations were like the pyramids,
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:29.920]   so to speak, you know, it was that way
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.280]   and it was always that way.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.680]   It is difficult in an old field
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.000]   to go back to the foundations
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.960]   and think about rewriting them.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.820]   It's a lot easier in young fields
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:42.380]   where you're still dealing with the first generation
[01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:44.040]   of people who invented the field.
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.500]   And it tends to be the case, you know,
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:48.620]   that the nature of what happens in science
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.240]   tends to be, you know, you'll get,
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:55.440]   typically the pattern is some methodological advance occurs
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.560]   and then there's a period of five years, 10 years,
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.280]   maybe a little bit longer than that,
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.840]   where there's lots of things that are now made possible
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.120]   by that methodological advance,
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.840]   whether it's, you know, I don't know, telescopes
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:09.760]   or whether that's some mathematical method or something.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.760]   It's, you know, there's a, something happens,
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:18.600]   a tool gets built and then you can do a bunch of stuff
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.640]   and there's a bunch of low-hanging fruit to be picked
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:24.020]   and that takes a certain amount of time.
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:27.000]   After that, all that low-hanging fruit is picked,
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.200]   then it's a hard slog for the next however many decades
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:35.680]   or century or more to get to the next sort of level
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:36.680]   at which one can do something.
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:39.480]   And it's kind of a, and it tends to be the case
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:41.480]   that in fields that are in that kind of,
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:44.160]   I wouldn't say cruise mode 'cause it's really hard work,
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:48.040]   but it's very hard work for very incremental progress.
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:51.080]   - And in your career and some of the things you've taken on,
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.440]   it feels like you're not,
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:55.360]   you haven't been afraid of the hard slog.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.480]   - Yeah, that's true.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.480]   - So it's quite interesting,
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:01.480]   especially on the engineering side.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:05.200]   And a small tangent, when you were at Caltech,
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:08.840]   did you get to interact with Richard Feynman at all?
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:10.880]   Do you have any memories of Richard?
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:13.520]   - We worked together quite a bit actually.
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.560]   In fact, and in fact, both when I was at Caltech
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:20.120]   and after I left Caltech, we were both consultants
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.200]   at this company called Thinking Machines Corporation,
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.960]   which was just down the street from here actually,
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.720]   as ultimately ill-fated company.
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:28.520]   But I used to say,
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.200]   this company is not gonna work
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:31.360]   with the strategy they have.
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:33.080]   And Dick Feynman always used to say,
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.560]   what do we know about running companies?
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.560]   Just let them run their company.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:41.560]   But anyway, he was not into that kind of thing.
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:44.080]   And he always thought that my interest
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.480]   in doing things like running companies
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.720]   was a distraction, so to speak.
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:53.720]   And for me, it's a mechanism to have a more effective machine
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:58.280]   for actually getting things, figuring things out
[01:28:58.280 --> 01:28:59.520]   and getting things to happen.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:02.680]   - Did he think of it, 'cause essentially what you used,
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:03.560]   you did with the company,
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.040]   I don't know if you were thinking of it that way,
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:09.920]   but you're creating tools to empower your,
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:12.800]   to empower the exploration of the university.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.080]   Do you think, did he--
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:16.560]   - Did he understand that point?
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.720]   - The point of tools of--
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.640]   - I think not as well as he might've done.
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:22.960]   I mean, I think that, but you know,
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:25.240]   he was actually my first company,
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:27.640]   which was also involved with,
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:30.280]   well, was involved with more mathematical computation
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:31.280]   kinds of things.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:35.800]   You know, he was quite, he had lots of advice
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:39.320]   about the technical side of what we should do and so on.
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.360]   - Do you have examples, memories or thoughts that--
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.120]   - Oh yeah, yeah, he had all kinds of,
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:46.720]   look, in the business of doing sort of,
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:47.960]   you know, one of the hard things in math
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.760]   is doing integrals and so on, right?
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.960]   And so he had his own elaborate ways
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:53.440]   to do integrals and so on.
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.360]   He had his own ways of thinking about sort of
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:57.960]   getting intuition about how math works.
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:01.720]   And so his sort of meta idea was,
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.440]   take those intuitional methods
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:06.280]   and make a computer follow those intuitional methods.
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:09.120]   Now it turns out for the most part,
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.080]   like when we do integrals and things,
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:14.400]   what we do is we build this kind of bizarre industrial
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:17.080]   machine that turns every integral into, you know,
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.800]   products of major G functions
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:21.320]   and generates this very elaborate thing.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.800]   And actually the big problem is turning the results
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:25.400]   into something a human will understand.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.680]   It's not, quote, doing the integral.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:30.240]   And actually Feynman did understand that to some extent.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:32.360]   And I'm embarrassed to say,
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:35.040]   he once gave me this big pile of, you know,
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.160]   calculational methods for particle physics
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:38.320]   that he worked out in the '50s.
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.640]   And he said, you know, it's more used to you
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:40.600]   than to me type thing.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:43.240]   And I was like, I've intended to look at it
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:45.400]   and give it back and I still have my files now.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.400]   So it's, but that's what happens
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.680]   when it's finiteness of human lives.
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:53.480]   It's, I, you know, maybe if he'd lived another 20 years,
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:55.280]   I would have remembered to give it back.
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.720]   But I think it's, you know,
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.880]   that was his attempt to systematize
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:04.200]   the ways that one does integrals
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:05.960]   that show up in particle physics and so on.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.120]   Turns out the way we've actually done it
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.760]   is very different from that way.
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.600]   - What do you make of that difference, Eugene?
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:14.280]   So Feynman was actually quite remarkable
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:18.680]   at creating sort of intuitive, like diving in, you know,
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:20.400]   creating intuitive frameworks
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.360]   for understanding difficult concepts is--
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.280]   - I'm smiling because, you know,
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:27.760]   the funny thing about him was that the thing
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:31.760]   he was really, really, really good at is calculating stuff.
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.200]   But he thought that was easy
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:35.560]   because he was really good at it.
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:37.240]   And so he would do these things
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.960]   where he would calculate some,
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.760]   do some complicated calculation
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.400]   in quantum field theory, for example,
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.040]   come out with a result.
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:47.080]   Wouldn't tell anybody about the complicated calculation
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.320]   'cause he thought that was easy.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.120]   He thought the really impressive thing
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.760]   was to have the simple intuition about how everything works.
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:56.040]   So he invented that at the end.
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:58.120]   And, you know, because he'd done this calculation
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:00.920]   and knew how it worked, it was a lot easier.
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.600]   It's a lot easier to have good intuition
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.400]   when you know what the answer is.
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:06.680]   And then he would just not tell anybody
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:07.720]   about these calculations.
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:10.360]   And he wasn't meaning that maliciously, so to speak.
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:12.240]   It's just, he thought that was easy.
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:15.520]   And that's, you know, that led to areas
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:17.280]   where people were just completely mystified
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.120]   and they kind of followed his intuition,
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:21.200]   but nobody could tell why it worked
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.840]   because actually the reason it worked
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.240]   was 'cause he'd done all these calculations
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.120]   and he knew that it would work.
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.360]   And, you know, when I, he and I worked a bit
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:32.880]   on quantum computers actually back in 1980, '81,
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.240]   before anybody had heard of those things.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.320]   And, you know, the typical mode of,
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:39.800]   I mean, he always used to say,
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:40.800]   and I now think about this
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.360]   'cause I'm about the age that he was
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:44.000]   when I worked with him.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.400]   And, you know, I see that people
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.640]   are one third my age, so to speak.
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.080]   And he was always complaining
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:50.560]   that I was one third his age.
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:52.160]   (both laughing)
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.560]   Various things, but, you know,
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:57.640]   he would do some calculation by hand,
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:58.680]   you know, on Blackboard and things,
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:00.600]   come up with some answer.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.960]   I'd say, "I don't understand this."
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:05.120]   You know, I do something with a computer
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:08.680]   and he'd say, you know, "I don't understand this."
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:11.160]   So there'd be some big argument about what was,
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:12.200]   you know, what was going on,
[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:13.440]   but it was always,
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:17.960]   and I think actually many of the things
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:21.560]   that we sort of realized about quantum computing
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.040]   that were sort of issues that have to do
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.200]   particularly with the measurement process
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.160]   are kind of still issues today.
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.600]   And I kind of find it interesting.
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:31.160]   It's a funny thing in science that these,
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:34.080]   you know, that there's a remarkable,
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:35.240]   it happens in technology too,
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:38.480]   there's a remarkable sort of repetition of history
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:40.200]   that ends up occurring.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.400]   Eventually things really get nailed down,
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.120]   but it often takes a while
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:46.720]   and it often things come back decades later.
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:49.880]   Well, for example, I could tell a story
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:52.320]   actually happened right down the street from here
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.880]   when we were both at thinking machines.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:58.440]   I had been working on this particular cellular automaton
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.520]   called Rule 30 that has this feature
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:03.320]   that from very simple initial conditions,
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:06.080]   it makes really complicated behavior, okay?
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:10.400]   So, and actually of all silly physical things,
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:13.400]   using this big parallel computer
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:17.000]   called the connection machine that that company was making,
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.800]   I generated this giant printout of Rule 30
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:23.400]   on very, on actually on the same kind of printer
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:28.400]   that people use to make layouts for microprocessors.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:32.560]   So one of these big, you know, large format printers
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:34.640]   with high resolution and so on.
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:38.600]   So, okay, so print this out, lots of very tiny cells.
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.600]   And so there was sort of a question
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:44.240]   of how some features of that pattern.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:47.120]   And so it was very much a physical, you know,
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:48.520]   on the floor with meter rules
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.480]   trying to measure different things.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:53.480]   So, so Feynman kind of takes me aside.
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:54.680]   We've been doing that for a little while
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:56.480]   and takes me aside and he says,
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:57.920]   "I just wanna know this one thing."
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:00.240]   He says, "I wanna know, how did you know
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:02.960]   that this Rule 30 thing would produce
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.320]   all this really complicated behavior
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.880]   that is so complicated that we're, you know,
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:09.200]   going around with this big printout and so on?"
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:11.520]   And I said, "Well, I didn't know.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.760]   I just enumerated all the possible rules
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.520]   and then observed that that's what happened."
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:18.840]   He said, "Oh, I feel a lot better.
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:20.800]   You know, I thought you had some intuition
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:23.440]   that he didn't have that would let one."
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:25.040]   I said, "No, no, no, no intuition,
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:26.920]   just experimental science."
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:31.080]   - Oh, that's such a beautiful sort of dichotomy there
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:32.680]   of that's exactly what you showed
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:35.320]   is you really can't have an intuition about it
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.640]   and you reduce it, I mean, you have to run it.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:38.480]   - Yes, that's right.
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:39.800]   - That's so hard for us humans
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:44.640]   and especially brilliant physicists like Feynman
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:49.640]   to say that you can't have a compressed, clean intuition
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:52.240]   about how the whole thing works.
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:53.520]   - Yes, yes.
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:56.280]   No, he was, I mean, I think he was sort of on the edge
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.600]   of understanding that point about computation.
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.280]   And I think he found that,
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:02.960]   I think he always found computation interesting.
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.680]   And I think that was sort of what he was
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:06.360]   a little bit poking at.
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.760]   I mean, that intuition, you know,
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.360]   the difficulty of discovering things,
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:11.960]   like even you say, "Oh, you know,
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:13.160]   you just enumerate all the cases
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.480]   and just find one that does something interesting, right?"
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:16.840]   Sounds very easy.
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:19.920]   Turns out, like, I missed it when I first saw it
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:21.920]   because I had kind of an intuition
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:23.400]   that said it shouldn't be there.
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:24.640]   And so I had kind of arguments,
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:27.480]   "Oh, I'm gonna ignore that case because whatever."
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:31.200]   - How did you have an open mind enough?
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.880]   Because you're essentially the same person
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:33.720]   as Richard Feynman,
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:36.320]   the same kind of physics type of thinking.
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.520]   How did you find yourself having a sufficiently open mind
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:44.920]   to be open to watching rules and them revealing complexity?
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:46.240]   - Yeah, I think that's an interesting question.
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:47.560]   I've wondered about that myself
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:49.040]   'cause it's kind of like, you know,
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.560]   you live through these things and then you say,
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:53.240]   "What was the historical story?"
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.640]   And sometimes the historical story
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:56.040]   that you realize after the fact
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:58.680]   was not what you lived through, so to speak.
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:02.320]   And so, you know, what I realized is I think
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:06.520]   what happened is, you know, I did physics
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:08.840]   kind of like reductionistic physics
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.280]   where you're thrown in the universe
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:13.240]   and you're told, "Go figure out what's going on inside it."
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:16.240]   And then I started building computer tools
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:18.640]   and I started building my first computer language,
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:19.800]   for example.
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.380]   And computer language is not like,
[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:23.120]   it's sort of like physics in the sense
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:24.800]   that you have to take all those computations
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.920]   people want to do and kind of drill down
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:30.280]   and find the primitives that they can all be made of.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:31.960]   But then you do something that's really different
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:33.520]   because you're just saying,
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:35.280]   "Okay, these are the primitives.
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.840]   "Now, you know, hopefully they'll be useful to people.
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:39.340]   "Let's build up from there."
[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:42.280]   So you're essentially building an artificial universe
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.600]   in a sense where you make this language,
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:45.960]   you've got these primitives,
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:48.880]   you're just building whatever you feel like building.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.720]   And that's, and so it was sort of interesting for me
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:53.640]   because from doing science where you're just
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:56.000]   thrown in the universe as the universe is
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.800]   to then just being told, you know,
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:01.120]   "You can make up any universe you want."
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:04.760]   And so I think that experience of making a computer language
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.680]   which is essentially building your own universe,
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:11.160]   so to speak, is, you know, that's kind of the,
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:14.200]   that's what gave me a somewhat different attitude
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:15.600]   towards what might be possible.
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:17.840]   It's like, let's just explore what can be done
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.780]   in these artificial universes
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:22.880]   rather than thinking the natural science way
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:25.440]   of let's be constrained by how the universe actually is.
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:26.720]   - Yeah, by being able to program,
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.720]   essentially you've, as opposed to being limited
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:34.280]   to just your mind and a pen, you now have,
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.040]   you've basically built another brain
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:38.120]   that you can use to explore the universe by,
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:39.760]   - Yeah, yeah. - Computer program,
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.600]   you know, is a kind of a brain.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.800]   - Right, and it's, well, it's, or a telescope,
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:44.960]   or, you know, it's a tool.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.720]   It lets you see stuff.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.040]   - But there's something fundamentally different
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:49.520]   between a computer and a telescope.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:54.520]   I mean, it just, I'm hoping not to romanticize the notion,
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:57.480]   but it's more general, the computer is more general
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:58.320]   than a telescope. - It is, it's more general.
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:01.420]   It's, I think, I mean, this point about,
[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:05.920]   you know, people say, oh, such and such a thing
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:08.500]   was almost discovered at such and such a time.
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.800]   The distance between, you know,
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:12.400]   the building the paradigm that allows you
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:15.140]   to actually understand stuff, or allows one to be open
[01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:18.200]   to seeing what's going on, that's really hard.
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:22.400]   And, you know, I think in, I've been fortunate in my life
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:23.760]   that I've spent a lot of my time
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:25.920]   building computational language,
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.640]   and that's an activity that, in a sense,
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:34.640]   works by sort of having to kind of create
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:37.360]   another level of abstraction, and kind of be open
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:39.140]   to different kinds of structures.
[01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:43.480]   But, you know, it's always, I mean, I'm fully aware of,
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:46.980]   I suppose, the fact that I have seen it a bunch of times
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:50.260]   of how easy it is to miss the obvious, so to speak.
[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:53.240]   That at least is factored into my attempt
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:56.840]   to not miss the obvious, although it may not succeed.
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:01.640]   - What do you think is the role of ego
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:04.240]   in the history of math and science?
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:08.480]   And more sort of, you know, a book title
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:10.920]   of something like "A New Kind of Science,"
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:14.160]   you've accomplished a huge amount.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.320]   And in fact, somebody said that Newton didn't have an ego,
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:19.840]   and I looked into it, and he had a huge ego.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:21.120]   - Yeah. - But from an outsider's
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.760]   perspective, some have said that you have
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.140]   a bit of an ego as well.
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:28.840]   Do you see it that way?
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:30.120]   Does ego get in the way?
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:31.120]   Is it empowering?
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:34.120]   Is it both sort of-- - No, it's complicated
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:35.000]   and unnecessary.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.880]   I mean, you know, I've had, look, I've spent more than half
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:39.680]   my life CEO-ing a tech company.
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:40.840]   - Right. - Okay?
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:45.500]   And, you know, that is a, I think it's actually very,
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:51.340]   it means that one's ego is not a distant thing.
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:53.860]   It's a thing that one encounters every day, so to speak,
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:56.500]   'cause it's all tied up with leadership
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:59.140]   and with how one, you know, develops an organization
[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:00.100]   and all these kinds of things.
[01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:02.860]   So, you know, it may be that if I'd been an academic,
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:05.160]   for example, I could have sort of, you know,
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:08.180]   checked the ego, put it on a shelf somewhere
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:10.220]   and ignored its characteristics, but--
[01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:12.500]   - But you're reminded of it quite often
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:15.180]   in the context of running a company.
[01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:16.980]   - Sure, I mean, that's what it's about.
[01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:19.220]   It's about leadership and, you know,
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:22.700]   leadership is intimately tied to ego.
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:23.660]   Now, what does it mean?
[01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:26.420]   I mean, what is the, you know, for me,
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:29.500]   I've been fortunate that I think I have reasonable
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:31.700]   intellectual confidence, so to speak.
[01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:35.460]   That is, you know, I'm one of these people
[01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:37.460]   who at this point, if somebody tells me something
[01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:41.220]   and I just don't understand it, my conclusion isn't
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:44.860]   that means I'm dumb, that my conclusion is
[01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:47.500]   there's something wrong with what I'm being told.
[01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.300]   And that was actually Dick Feynman used to have
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:52.460]   that feature too, he never really believed in.
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:54.660]   He actually believed in experts much less
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:57.540]   than I believe in experts, so--
[01:41:57.540 --> 01:42:02.540]   - Wow, so that's a fundamentally powerful property of ego
[01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:06.560]   and saying like, not that I am wrong,
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:11.140]   but that the world is wrong in telling me,
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:14.180]   like when confronted with the fact that doesn't fit
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:16.700]   the thing that you've really thought through,
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:19.820]   sort of both the negative and the positive of ego.
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:23.460]   Do you see the negative of that get in the way,
[01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:24.300]   sort of being confronted with--
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:27.140]   - Sure, there are mistakes I've made that are the result
[01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:31.560]   of I'm pretty sure I'm right and turns out I'm not.
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:34.620]   I mean, that's the, you know, but the thing is
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:39.620]   that the idea that one tries to do things that,
[01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:42.340]   so for example, you know, one question is,
[01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:44.380]   if people have tried hard to do something
[01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:48.420]   and then one thinks, maybe I should try doing this myself,
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:50.500]   if one does not have a certain degree
[01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.100]   of intellectual confidence, one just says,
[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:54.340]   well, people have been trying to do this for 100 years,
[01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:56.180]   how am I gonna be able to do this?
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:58.580]   And, you know, I was fortunate in the sense
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:01.860]   that I happened to start having some degree of success
[01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:04.060]   in science and things when I was really young.
[01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:05.980]   And so that developed a certain amount
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:07.700]   of sort of intellectual confidence
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:09.860]   that I don't think I otherwise would have had.
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:12.940]   And, you know, in a sense, I mean, I was fortunate
[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:15.620]   that I was working in a field, particle physics,
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:18.980]   during its sort of golden age of rapid progress.
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:22.540]   And that kind of gives one a false sense of achievement
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:24.940]   because it's kind of easy to discover stuff
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:27.180]   that's gonna survive if you happen to be, you know,
[01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:28.340]   picking the low-hanging fruit
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:30.580]   of a rapidly expanding field.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:33.780]   - I mean, the reason I totally immediately understood
[01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:36.540]   the ego behind a new kind of science, to me,
[01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:38.620]   let me sort of just try to express my feelings
[01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:42.540]   on the whole thing, is that if you don't allow
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:46.780]   that kind of ego, then you would never write that book.
[01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:49.140]   That you would say, well, people must have done this.
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:50.740]   There's not, you would not dig.
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.460]   You would not keep digging. - Yeah, that's right.
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:57.260]   - And I think that was, I think you have to take that ego
[01:43:57.260 --> 01:43:59.420]   and write it and see where it takes you.
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:03.660]   And that's how you create exceptional work.
[01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:06.380]   - But I think the other point about that book was,
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:10.020]   it was a non-trivial question, how to take a bunch of ideas
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:12.340]   that are, I think, reasonably big ideas.
[01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:15.820]   They might, you know, their importance is determined
[01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:16.940]   by what happens historically.
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:18.260]   One can't tell how important they are.
[01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:20.840]   One can tell sort of the scope of them.
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:22.780]   And the scope is fairly big.
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:25.220]   And they're very different from things
[01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:26.140]   that have come before.
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:27.400]   And the question is, how do you explain
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:28.800]   that stuff to people?
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:31.940]   And so I had had the experience of sort of saying,
[01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:34.340]   well, there are these things, there's a cellular automaton,
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:36.060]   it does this, it does that.
[01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:38.060]   And people are like, oh, it must be just like this.
[01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:39.220]   It must be just like that.
[01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:40.300]   So no, it isn't.
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:42.340]   It's something different, right?
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:44.180]   - And so you could have done sort of,
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:45.460]   I'm really glad you did what you did,
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:47.340]   but you could have done sort of academically,
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:50.540]   just publish, keep publishing small papers here and there.
[01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:51.780]   And then you would just keep getting
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.060]   this kind of resistance, right?
[01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:56.660]   You would get like, it's supposed to just dropping
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:58.140]   a thing that says, here it is.
[01:44:58.140 --> 01:45:00.180]   Here's the full thing.
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:01.500]   - No, I mean, that was my calculation,
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:03.300]   is that basically, you know,
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:05.500]   you could introduce little pieces
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:08.020]   that's like, you know, one possibility is like,
[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:10.360]   it's the secret weapon, so to speak.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.460]   It's this, you know, I keep on, you know,
[01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:14.220]   discovering these things in all these different areas.
[01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:15.340]   Where'd they come from?
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:16.340]   Nobody knows.
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:18.460]   But I decided that, you know, in the interests
[01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:19.980]   of one only has one life to lead,
[01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:24.300]   and, you know, writing that book took me a decade anyway.
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:26.220]   It's not, there's not a lot of wiggle room, so to speak.
[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:28.900]   One can't be wrong by a factor of three, so to speak,
[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:30.980]   and how long it's gonna take.
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:33.980]   That I, you know, I thought the best thing to do,
[01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:36.540]   the thing that is most sort of,
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:41.540]   that most respects the intellectual content, so to speak,
[01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:45.780]   is you just put it out with as much force as you can,
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:47.660]   because it's not something where,
[01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:49.500]   and, you know, it's an interesting thing.
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.900]   You talk about ego, and it's, you know,
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:55.700]   for example, I run a company which has my name on it, right?
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:57.740]   I thought about starting a club for people
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:45:59.540]   whose companies have their names on them,
[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:00.980]   and it's a funny group,
[01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:03.300]   because we're not a bunch of egomaniacs.
[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:05.740]   That's not what it's about, so to speak.
[01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:08.860]   It's about basically sort of taking responsibility
[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:12.260]   for what one's doing, and, you know, in a sense,
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:13.740]   any of these things where you're sort of
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:16.100]   putting yourself on the line,
[01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:21.980]   it's kind of a funny, it's a funny dynamic,
[01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:26.340]   because in a sense, my company is sort of something
[01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:28.060]   that happens to have my name on it,
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:29.260]   but it's kind of bigger than me,
[01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:32.340]   and I'm kind of just its mascot at some level.
[01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:34.740]   I mean, I also happen to be a pretty, you know,
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:36.980]   strong leader of it, but--
[01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:39.820]   - But it's basically showing a deep,
[01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:44.620]   inextricable sort of investment.
[01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:47.380]   The same, your name, like Steve Jobs's name
[01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:52.380]   wasn't on Apple, but he was Apple.
[01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:54.500]   - Yes. - Elon Musk's name
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:57.260]   is not on Tesla, but he is Tesla.
[01:46:57.260 --> 01:46:59.980]   So it's like, meaning emotionally.
[01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:02.660]   If a company succeeds or fails, he would just,
[01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:06.060]   that emotionally, he would suffer through that.
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:07.820]   And so that's a beautiful--
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:09.460]   - Yeah, it's recognizing that fact.
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:11.540]   - And also, Wolfram's a pretty good branding name,
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:12.780]   so it works out. (laughs)
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:14.220]   - Yeah, right, exactly.
[01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:16.500]   I think Steve had a bad deal there.
[01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:19.780]   - Yeah, so you made up for it with the last name.
[01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:24.780]   Okay, so in 2002, you published "A New Kind of Science,"
[01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:28.860]   to which, sort of on a personal level,
[01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:30.980]   I can credit my love for cellular automaton
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:32.380]   and computation in general.
[01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:35.540]   I think a lot of others can as well.
[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:40.540]   Can you briefly describe the vision, the hope,
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:46.220]   the main idea presented in this 1,200-page book?
[01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:50.380]   - Sure, although it took 1,200 pages to say in the book,
[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:54.980]   so no, the real idea, it's kind of,
[01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:56.940]   a good way to get into it is to look at, sort of,
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:58.980]   the arc of history and to look at what's happened
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:00.940]   in kind of the development of science.
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:03.960]   I mean, there was this sort of big idea in science
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:06.360]   about 300 years ago that was,
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:08.820]   let's use mathematical equations
[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:11.100]   to try and describe things in the world.
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:14.860]   Let's use sort of the formal idea of mathematical equations
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:16.880]   to describe what might be happening in the world,
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:18.140]   rather than, for example,
[01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:20.800]   just using sort of logical augmentation and so on.
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:23.740]   Let's have a formal theory about that.
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:26.020]   And so there'd been this 300-year run
[01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:27.420]   of using mathematical equations
[01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:28.500]   to describe the natural world,
[01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:30.100]   which had worked pretty well.
[01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:33.660]   But I got interested in how one could generalize
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:34.820]   that notion.
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:37.460]   There is a formal theory, there are definite rules,
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:40.080]   but what structure could those rules have?
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.380]   And so what I got interested in was,
[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:44.500]   let's generalize beyond the sort of purely
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:48.100]   mathematical rules, and we now have this sort of notion
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:50.680]   of programming and computing and so on.
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:53.940]   Let's use the kinds of rules that can be embodied
[01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:57.420]   in programs as a sort of generalization
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.760]   of the ones that can exist in mathematics
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:01.740]   as a way to describe the world.
[01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:04.860]   And so my kind of favorite version
[01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:07.180]   of these kinds of simple rules
[01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:09.100]   are these things called cellular automata.
[01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:10.620]   And so a typical case--
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:13.980]   - So wait, what are cellular automata?
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:14.820]   - Fair enough.
[01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:16.980]   So typical case of a cellular automaton,
[01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:19.380]   it's an array of cells.
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:23.140]   It's just a line of discrete cells.
[01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:25.420]   Each cell is either black or white.
[01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:28.460]   And in a series of steps that you can represent
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:30.640]   as lines going down a page,
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:32.660]   you're updating the color of each cell
[01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:34.940]   according to a rule that depends on the color
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:37.220]   of the cell above it and to its left and right.
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:38.040]   So it's really simple.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:40.580]   So a thing might be, you know,
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:45.580]   if the cell and its right neighbor are not the same,
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:53.660]   and, or the cell on the left is black or something,
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:56.060]   then make it black on the next step.
[01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:57.900]   And if not, make it white.
[01:49:57.900 --> 01:49:58.800]   Typical rule.
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:02.300]   That rule, I'm not sure I said it exactly right,
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:04.680]   but a rule very much like what I just said
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:06.360]   has the feature that if you started off
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:08.420]   from just one black cell at the top,
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:10.740]   it makes this extremely complicated pattern.
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:14.580]   So some rules, you get a very simple pattern.
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:18.440]   Some rules, you have the rule is simple.
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.840]   You start them off from a sort of simple seed.
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:23.020]   You just get this very simple pattern.
[01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:25.940]   But other rules, and this was the big surprise
[01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:27.460]   when I started actually just doing
[01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:30.360]   the simple computer experiments to find out what happens,
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:33.780]   is that they produce very complicated patterns of behavior.
[01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:38.060]   So for example, this rule 30 rule has the feature
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:40.580]   you started from just one black cell at the top,
[01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:43.320]   makes this very random pattern.
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:46.500]   If you look like at the center column of cells,
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:48.920]   you get a series of values.
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:51.580]   It goes black, white, black, black, whatever it is.
[01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:55.640]   That sequence seems for all practical purposes random.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:58.960]   So it's kind of like in math,
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:03.800]   you compute the digits of pi, 3.1415926, whatever.
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:05.920]   Those digits once computed,
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:07.980]   I mean, the scheme for computing pi,
[01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:09.380]   it's the ratio of the circumference
[01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:11.960]   to diameter of a circle, very well-defined.
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:16.000]   But yet, once you've generated those digits,
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.060]   they seem for all practical purposes completely random.
[01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:21.280]   And so it is with rule 30,
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:24.300]   that even though the rule is very simple, much simpler,
[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:27.100]   much more sort of computationally obvious
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:29.400]   than the rule for generating digits of pi,
[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:31.260]   even with a rule that simple,
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:34.220]   you're still generating immensely complicated behavior.
[01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:35.900]   - Yeah, so if we could just pause on that,
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:39.240]   I think you probably have said it and looked at it so long,
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:41.540]   you forgot the magic of it, or perhaps you don't,
[01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:42.580]   you still feel the magic.
[01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:47.060]   But to me, if you've never seen sort of,
[01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:49.500]   I would say, what is it, a one-dimensional,
[01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:52.580]   essentially, called the automata, right?
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:56.100]   And you were to guess what you would see
[01:51:56.100 --> 01:52:00.580]   if you have some sort of cells
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:03.280]   that only respond to its neighbors.
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:05.340]   - Right. - If you were to guess
[01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:07.380]   what kind of things you would see,
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:10.060]   like my initial guess,
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:12.100]   like even when I first opened your book
[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:13.940]   on "The New Kind of Science," right?
[01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:16.300]   My initial guess is you would see,
[01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:19.460]   I mean, it would be very simple stuff.
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:21.100]   - Right. - And I think
[01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:23.660]   it's a magical experience to realize
[01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:26.420]   the kind of complexity, you mentioned rule 30,
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:28.820]   still your favorite cellular automaton?
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:30.420]   - Still my favorite rule, yes.
[01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:34.540]   - You get complexity, immense complexity.
[01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:36.860]   You get arbitrary complexity.
[01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:37.900]   - Yes. - And when you say
[01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:40.000]   randomness down the middle column,
[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:44.900]   that's just one cool way to say
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:46.860]   that there's incredible complexity.
[01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:50.900]   And that's just, I mean, that's a magical idea.
[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:52.340]   However you start to interpret it,
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:54.780]   all the reducibility discussions, all that,
[01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:56.380]   but it's just, I think,
[01:52:56.380 --> 01:52:59.380]   that has profound philosophical
[01:52:59.380 --> 01:53:01.740]   kind of notions around it, too.
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:03.220]   It's not just-- - Oh, yeah.
[01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:05.580]   - I mean, it's transformational about how you see the world.
[01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:07.580]   I think for me, it was transformational.
[01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:10.220]   I don't know, we can have all kinds of discussions
[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:12.940]   about computation and so on, but just,
[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:17.780]   I sometimes think if I were on a desert island
[01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:22.300]   and was, I don't know, maybe it was some psychedelics
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:24.780]   or something, but if I had to take one book,
[01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:26.180]   I mean, "New Kind of Science" would be it
[01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:29.140]   'cause you could just enjoy that notion.
[01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:31.500]   For some reason, it's a deeply profound notion,
[01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:33.300]   at least to me. - I find it that way, yeah.
[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:34.740]   I mean, look, it's been,
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:40.740]   it was a very intuition-breaking thing to discover.
[01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:42.660]   I mean, it's kind of like, you know,
[01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:45.660]   you point the computational telescope out there
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:48.860]   and suddenly you see, I don't know, you know,
[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:50.460]   in the past, it's kind of like, you know,
[01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:51.620]   moons of Jupiter or something,
[01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:52.940]   but suddenly you see something that's kind of
[01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:56.620]   very unexpected, and Rule 30 was very unexpected for me.
[01:53:56.620 --> 01:53:58.780]   And the big challenge at a personal level
[01:53:58.780 --> 01:54:01.060]   was to not ignore it.
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:03.220]   I mean, people, you know, in other words,
[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:05.580]   you might say, you know-- - It's a bug.
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:07.340]   - What would you say, yeah, what would you say?
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:08.980]   - Yeah, I mean, I-- - What are we looking at,
[01:54:08.980 --> 01:54:09.820]   by the way?
[01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:10.980]   - Well, I was just generating here,
[01:54:10.980 --> 01:54:13.140]   I'll actually generate a Rule 30 pattern.
[01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:17.500]   So that's the rule for Rule 30, and it says,
[01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:20.260]   for example, it says here, if you have a black cell
[01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:21.780]   in the middle and a black cell to the left
[01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:22.860]   and a white cell to the right,
[01:54:22.860 --> 01:54:25.420]   then the cell on the next step will be white.
[01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:27.900]   And so here's the actual pattern that you get
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:31.540]   starting off from a single black cell at the top there.
[01:54:31.540 --> 01:54:33.980]   And then-- - That's the initial state,
[01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:35.560]   initial condition. - That's the initial thing,
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:36.820]   you just start off from that,
[01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:38.940]   and then you're going down the page,
[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:43.060]   and at every step, you're just applying this rule
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:45.420]   to find out the new value that you get.
[01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:48.300]   And so you might think, rule that simple,
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:50.460]   you gotta get the, there's gotta be some trace
[01:54:50.460 --> 01:54:52.140]   of that simplicity here.
[01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:55.340]   Okay, we'll run it, let's say, for 400 steps.
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:57.540]   It's what it does, it's kind of aliasing a bit
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:59.580]   on the screen there, but you can see
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:02.380]   there's a little bit of regularity over on the left.
[01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:06.320]   But there's a lot of stuff here that just looks
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:08.520]   very complicated, very random,
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:12.160]   and that's a big sort of shock to,
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:14.520]   was a big shock to my intuition, at least,
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:15.640]   that that's possible.
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:18.200]   - Your mind immediately starts, is there a pattern?
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.960]   There must be a repetitive pattern.
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:20.780]   - Yeah, right. - There must be,
[01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:22.160]   that's where the mind goes. - Well, right, so I spent,
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:24.320]   so indeed, that's what I thought at first,
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:27.080]   and I thought, well, this is kind of interesting,
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:30.000]   but if we run it long enough, we'll see,
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.580]   something will resolve into something simple.
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:37.260]   And I did all kinds of analysis of using mathematics,
[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:40.400]   statistics, cryptography, whatever, whatever,
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:43.580]   to try and crack it, and I never succeeded.
[01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:45.300]   And after I hadn't succeeded for a while,
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:48.940]   I started thinking, maybe there's a real phenomenon here
[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:50.620]   that is the reason I'm not succeeding.
[01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:52.580]   Maybe, I mean, the thing that, for me,
[01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:55.140]   was sort of a motivating factor was looking
[01:55:55.140 --> 01:55:57.500]   at the natural world and seeing all this complexity
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:55:59.100]   that exists in the natural world,
[01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:00.740]   the question is, where does it come from?
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:03.000]   You know, what secret does nature have
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.100]   that lets it make all this complexity
[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:07.300]   that we humans, when we engineer things,
[01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:09.060]   typically are not making?
[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:10.300]   We're typically making things
[01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:12.820]   that at least look quite simple to us.
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:16.660]   And so the shock here was, even from something very simple,
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:19.360]   you're making something that complex.
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:23.020]   Maybe this is getting at sort of the secret that nature has
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:25.820]   that allows it to make really complex things,
[01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:29.420]   even though its underlying rules may not be that complex.
[01:56:29.420 --> 01:56:30.620]   - How did it make you feel?
[01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:33.460]   If we look at the Newton apple,
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:36.460]   was there, you know, you took a walk
[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:40.220]   and something, it profoundly hit you,
[01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:42.060]   or was this a gradual thing?
[01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:43.380]   A lobster being boiled?
[01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:47.220]   - The truth of every sort of science discovery
[01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:49.260]   is it's not that gradual.
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:51.540]   I mean, I've spent, I happen to be interested
[01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:53.140]   in scientific biography kinds of things,
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:54.580]   and so I've tried to track down, you know,
[01:56:54.580 --> 01:56:57.660]   how did people come to figure out this or that thing?
[01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:02.660]   And there's always a long kind of sort of preparatory,
[01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:05.740]   you know, there's a need to be prepared
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:08.660]   and a mindset in which it's possible to see something.
[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:10.460]   I mean, in the case of Rule 30,
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:12.900]   I was around June 1st, 1984,
[01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:15.940]   was kind of a silly story in some ways.
[01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:18.660]   I finally had a high resolution laser printer.
[01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:19.880]   So I was able, so I thought,
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:21.300]   I'm gonna generate a bunch of pictures
[01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:24.400]   of the acyllar automata, and I generate this one,
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:28.460]   and I put it on some plane flight to Europe,
[01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:30.420]   and I have this with me, and it's like,
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:33.500]   you know, I really should try to understand this,
[01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:35.140]   and this is really, you know,
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:37.500]   this is, I really don't understand what's going on,
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:39.820]   and that was kind of the, you know,
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:43.860]   slowly trying to see what was happening.
[01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:48.160]   It was not, it was depressingly unsudden, so to speak,
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:51.420]   in the sense that a lot of these ideas,
[01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:54.760]   like principle of computational equivalence, for example,
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:57.240]   you know, I thought, well, that's a possible thing.
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:57:58.760]   I didn't know if it's correct.
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:01.480]   Still didn't know for sure that it's correct,
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:02.840]   but it's sort of a gradual thing,
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:05.980]   that these things gradually kind of become,
[01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:08.120]   seem more important than one thought.
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:10.200]   I mean, I think the whole idea
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:13.400]   of studying the computational universe of simple programs,
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:17.280]   it took me probably a decade, decade and a half
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:18.800]   to kind of internalize
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:20.760]   that that was really an important idea.
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:23.240]   And I think, you know, if it turns out,
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:25.740]   we find the whole universe lurking out there
[01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:27.440]   in the computational universe,
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:28.820]   that's a good, you know,
[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:32.320]   it's a good brownie point or something for the whole idea.
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:35.620]   But I think that the thing that's strange
[01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:37.840]   in this whole question about, you know,
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:39.480]   finding this different raw material
[01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:41.060]   for making models of things,
[01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:45.140]   what's been interesting sort of in the arc of history
[01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:46.540]   is, you know, for 300 years,
[01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:49.540]   it's kind of like the mathematical equations approach.
[01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:50.580]   It was the winner.
[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:51.500]   It was the thing, you know,
[01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:53.180]   you want to have a really good model
[01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:55.300]   for something that's what you use.
[01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:56.780]   The thing that's been remarkable
[01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:59.100]   is just in the last decade or so,
[01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:00.660]   I think one can see a transition
[01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:03.600]   to using not mathematical equations,
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:06.260]   but programs as sort of the raw material
[01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:08.260]   for making models of stuff.
[01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:10.020]   And that's pretty neat.
[01:59:10.020 --> 01:59:11.720]   And it's kind of, you know,
[01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:14.520]   as somebody who's kind of lived inside this paradigm shift,
[01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:17.380]   so to speak, it is bizarre.
[01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:19.840]   I mean, no doubt in sort of the history of science,
[01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:22.860]   that will be seen as an instantaneous paradigm shift,
[01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:25.180]   but it sure isn't instantaneous when it's played out
[01:59:25.180 --> 01:59:26.940]   in one's actual life, so to speak.
[01:59:26.940 --> 01:59:28.320]   It seems glacial.
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:33.340]   And it's the kind of thing where it's sort of interesting
[01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:36.980]   because in the dynamics of sort of the adoption
[01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:40.460]   of ideas like that into different fields,
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:43.660]   the younger the field, the faster the adoption typically,
[01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:46.780]   because people are not kind of locked in
[01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:48.300]   where the fifth generation of people
[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:52.200]   who've studied this field, and it is the way it is,
[01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:53.840]   and it can never be any different.
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:55.720]   And I think that's been, you know,
[01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:57.960]   watching that process has been interesting.
[01:59:57.960 --> 02:00:01.460]   I mean, I think I'm fortunate that I've,
[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:05.560]   I do stuff mainly 'cause I like doing it.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:09.840]   And if I was, that makes me kind of thick-skinned
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:12.040]   about the world's response to what I do.
[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:15.560]   But that's definitely, you know,
[02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:18.080]   and anytime you write a book called something
[02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:21.080]   like "A New Kind of Science," it's kind of,
[02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:25.000]   the pitchforks will come out for the old kind of science.
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.660]   And it was interesting dynamics.
[02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:27.780]   I think that the,
[02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:33.600]   I have to say that I was fully aware of the fact that
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:38.460]   when you see sort of incipient paradigm shifts in science,
[02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:43.160]   the vigor of the negative response upon early introduction
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:45.600]   is a fantastic positive indicator
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:48.440]   of good long-term results.
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:51.800]   So in other words, if people just don't care,
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:55.120]   it's, you know, that's not such a good sign.
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:56.720]   If they're like, oh, this is great,
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:00:59.680]   that means you didn't really discover anything interesting.
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:03.240]   - What fascinating properties of Rule 30
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:05.000]   have you discovered over the years?
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.440]   You've recently announced the Rule 30 prizes
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:09.720]   for solving three key problems.
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:12.440]   Can you maybe talk about interesting properties
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:15.360]   that have been kind of revealed?
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:17.240]   Rule 30 or other cellular automata
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:19.840]   and what problems are still before us,
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:21.360]   like the three problems you've announced?
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:22.200]   - Yeah, yeah, right.
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:27.040]   So I mean, the most interesting thing about cellular automata
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:29.440]   is that it's hard to figure stuff out about them.
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:32.520]   And that's some, in a sense,
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:34.260]   every time you try and sort of,
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:37.560]   you try and bash them with some other technique,
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:40.040]   you say, can I crack them?
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.360]   The answer is they seem to be uncrackable.
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:46.160]   They seem to have the feature that they are,
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:49.200]   that they're sort of showing irreducible computation.
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:51.440]   They're not, you're not able to say,
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:53.560]   oh, I know exactly what this is going to do.
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:55.600]   It's going to do this or that.
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:58.520]   - But there's specific formulations of that fact.
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:01:59.360]   - Yes, right.
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:01.760]   So I mean, for example, in Rule 30,
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:03.320]   in the pattern you get just starting
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:04.880]   from a single black cell,
[02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:07.120]   you get this sort of very,
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:10.080]   very sort of random looking pattern.
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:11.160]   And so one feature of that,
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:12.840]   just look at the center column.
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:15.480]   And for example, we use that for a long time
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:18.000]   to generate randomness in Wolfram language.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.560]   Just, you know, what Rule 30 produces.
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:23.880]   Now the question is, can you prove how random it is?
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:26.320]   So for example, one very simple question,
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:28.760]   can you prove that it'll never repeat?
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:31.520]   We haven't been able to show that it will never repeat.
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:35.760]   We know that if there are two adjacent columns,
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:37.680]   we know they can't both repeat.
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:40.560]   But just knowing whether that center column can ever repeat,
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:42.080]   we still don't even know that.
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:46.680]   Another problem that I sort of put in my collection of,
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:49.120]   you know, it's like $30,000 for three,
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:53.000]   you know, for these three prizes for about Rule 30.
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.240]   I would say that this is not one of those,
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:57.000]   this is one of those cases where
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.840]   the money is not the main point,
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:01.160]   but it's just, you know,
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:05.680]   helps motivate somehow the investigation.
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:07.280]   - So there's three problems you propose,
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:09.800]   you get $30,000 if you solve all three,
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:10.640]   or maybe, I don't know.
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:12.120]   - No, it's 10,000 for each.
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:12.960]   - For each, right.
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:13.920]   - Yeah, my--
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:16.040]   - The problem is, that's right, money's not the thing.
[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:17.000]   The problems are themselves,
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.880]   they're just clean formulations of chat lots.
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:22.840]   - It's just, you know, will it ever become periodic?
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:25.020]   Second problem is, are there an equal number
[02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:26.320]   of black and white cells?
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:27.160]   - Down the middle column.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:28.420]   - Down the middle column.
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:30.160]   And the third problem is a little bit harder to state,
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:33.240]   which is essentially, is there a way of figuring out
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:36.600]   what the color of a cell at position T
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:38.480]   down the center column is
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:43.320]   with a less computational effort than about T steps?
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:46.320]   So in other words, is there a way to jump ahead and say,
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:48.120]   I know what this is gonna do, you know,
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:53.120]   it's just some mathematical function of T.
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:55.000]   - Or proving that there is no way.
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.680]   - Or proving there is no way, yes.
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:59.080]   But both, I mean, you know, for any one of these,
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:01.760]   one could prove that, you know, one could discover,
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:04.680]   you know, we know what rule 30 does for a billion steps,
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:07.040]   but, and maybe we'll know for a trillion steps
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:10.500]   before too very long, but maybe at a quadrillion steps,
[02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:12.280]   it suddenly becomes repetitive.
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:14.840]   You might say, how could that possibly happen?
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:17.240]   But so when I was writing up these prizes,
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:19.440]   I thought, and this is typical of what happens
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:20.520]   in the computational universe,
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:24.020]   I thought, let me find an example where it looks like
[02:04:24.020 --> 02:04:25.480]   it's just gonna be random forever,
[02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:27.520]   but actually it becomes repetitive.
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:30.060]   And I found one, and it's just, you know, I did a search,
[02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:33.520]   I searched, I don't know, maybe a million different rules
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:36.540]   with some criterion, and this is,
[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:38.600]   what's sort of interesting about that is,
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:42.100]   I kind of have this thing that I say in a kind of silly way
[02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:44.480]   about the computational universe, which is, you know,
[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:46.640]   the animals are always smarter than you are.
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:47.800]   That is, there's always some way
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:49.200]   one of these computational systems
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:51.040]   is gonna figure out how to do something,
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:53.600]   even though I can't imagine how it's gonna do it.
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:55.760]   And, you know, I didn't think I would find one
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:57.400]   that, you know, you would think after all these years
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:59.700]   that when I found sort of all possible things,
[02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:05.300]   funky things that I would have,
[02:05:05.300 --> 02:05:07.360]   that I would have gotten my intuition wrapped
[02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:10.160]   around the idea that, you know,
[02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:12.720]   these creatures are always, in the computational universe,
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:15.440]   are always smarter than I'm gonna be, but, you know--
[02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:17.240]   - Well, they're equivalently smart, right?
[02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:18.080]   - That's correct.
[02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:21.800]   And that makes it, that makes one feel very sort of,
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:26.560]   it's humbling every time, because every time the thing is,
[02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:28.000]   you know, you think it's gonna do this,
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.960]   or it's not gonna be possible to do this,
[02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:31.640]   and it turns out it finds a way.
[02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:32.880]   - Of course, the promising thing is,
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:35.740]   there's a lot of other rules like rule 30.
[02:05:35.740 --> 02:05:37.820]   It's just rule 30 is--
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:39.740]   - Oh, it's my favorite, 'cause I found it first,
[02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:40.620]   and that's the-- - That's right.
[02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:42.860]   But the problems are focusing on rule 30.
[02:05:42.860 --> 02:05:46.540]   It's possible that rule 30 is repetitive
[02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:47.900]   after a trillion steps.
[02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:48.740]   - It is possible.
[02:05:48.740 --> 02:05:50.620]   - And that doesn't prove anything about the other rules.
[02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:51.460]   - It does not, but--
[02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:53.660]   - But this is a good sort of experiment
[02:05:53.660 --> 02:05:56.260]   of how you go about trying to prove something
[02:05:56.260 --> 02:05:57.260]   about a particular rule.
[02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:00.620]   - Yes, and it also, all these things help build intuition.
[02:06:00.620 --> 02:06:02.180]   That is, if it turned out
[02:06:02.180 --> 02:06:04.980]   that this was repetitive after a trillion steps,
[02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:07.420]   that's not what I would expect,
[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:09.360]   and so we learn something from that.
[02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:11.380]   - The method to do that, though,
[02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:12.900]   would reveal something interesting
[02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:15.140]   about the cellular-- - No doubt, no doubt.
[02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:18.300]   I mean, it's, although it's sometimes challenging,
[02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:20.860]   like the, you know, I put out a prize in 2007
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:24.540]   for a particular Turing machine
[02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:27.140]   that I, that was the simplest candidate
[02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:29.380]   for being a universal Turing machine,
[02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:32.140]   and the young chap in England named Alex Smith,
[02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:35.460]   after a smallish number of months said,
[02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:37.260]   "I've got a proof," and he did.
[02:06:37.260 --> 02:06:38.700]   You know, it took a little while to iterate,
[02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:40.420]   but he had a proof.
[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:42.680]   Unfortunately, the proof is very,
[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:45.900]   it's a lot of micro details.
[02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:48.740]   It's not like you look at it and you say,
[02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:51.760]   "Aha, there's a big new principle."
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:54.960]   The big new principle is the simplest Turing machine
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:57.900]   that might have been universal actually is universal,
[02:06:57.900 --> 02:07:00.500]   and it's incredibly much simpler than the Turing machines
[02:07:00.500 --> 02:07:03.000]   that people already knew were universal before that,
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.460]   and so that, intuitionally, is important
[02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:07.940]   'cause it says computation universality
[02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:10.660]   is closer at hand than you might have thought,
[02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:13.100]   but the actual methods are not,
[02:07:13.100 --> 02:07:15.100]   in that particular case, were not terribly illuminated.
[02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:18.060]   - It would be nice if the methods would also be elegant.
[02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:19.500]   - That's true, yeah, no, I mean,
[02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:21.780]   I think it's one of these things where,
[02:07:21.780 --> 02:07:24.260]   I mean, it's like a lot of, we've talked about earlier,
[02:07:24.260 --> 02:07:28.460]   kind of opening up AIs and machine learning and things
[02:07:28.460 --> 02:07:32.060]   and what's going on inside, and is it just step-by-step,
[02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:35.260]   or can you sort of see the bigger picture more abstractly?
[02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:38.100]   - It's unfortunate, I mean, with Fermat's last theorem proof,
[02:07:38.100 --> 02:07:39.780]   it's unfortunate that the proof
[02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:44.620]   to such an elegant theorem is not,
[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:49.060]   I mean, it's not, it doesn't fit into the margins of a page.
[02:07:49.060 --> 02:07:50.300]   - That's true, but there's no,
[02:07:50.300 --> 02:07:52.520]   one of the things is that's another consequence
[02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:54.460]   of computational irreducibility,
[02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:58.600]   this fact that there are even quite short results
[02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:01.860]   in mathematics whose proofs are arbitrarily long.
[02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:03.780]   That's a consequence of all this stuff,
[02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:06.140]   and it makes one wonder,
[02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:09.580]   how come mathematics is possible at all?
[02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:13.620]   Why is it the case, how have people managed to navigate
[02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:16.340]   doing mathematics through looking at things
[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:19.440]   where they're not just thrown into, it's all undecidable?
[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:23.560]   That's its own separate story.
[02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:28.560]   - And that would be, that would have a poetic beauty to it
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:32.400]   if people were to find something interesting about rule 30,
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:35.560]   because, I mean, there's an emphasis
[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:36.640]   to this particular rule.
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:39.640]   It wouldn't say anything about the broad irreducibility
[02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:42.380]   of all computations, but it would nevertheless
[02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:45.280]   put a few smiles on people's faces of--
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:50.120]   - Well, yeah, but to me, it's like, in a sense,
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:53.000]   establishing principle of computational equivalence,
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.360]   it's a little bit like doing inductive science anywhere.
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:58.800]   That is, the more examples you find,
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:01.440]   the more convinced you are that it's generally true.
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:04.940]   I mean, we don't get to, whenever we do natural science,
[02:09:04.940 --> 02:09:08.840]   we say, well, it's true here that this or that happens.
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:11.560]   Can we prove that it's true everywhere in the universe?
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:12.940]   No, we can't.
[02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:15.800]   So, it's the same thing here.
[02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:17.440]   We're exploring the computational universe.
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:20.440]   We're establishing facts in the computational universe,
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:22.520]   and that's sort of a way
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:27.520]   of inductively concluding general things.
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:32.020]   - Just to think through this a little bit,
[02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:33.520]   we've touched on it a little bit before,
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:36.680]   but what's the difference between the kind of computation,
[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:39.280]   now that we're talking about cellular automata,
[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:41.320]   what's the difference between the kind of computation,
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:44.640]   biological systems, our mind, our bodies,
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:48.200]   the things we see before us that emerged
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:52.220]   through the process of evolution, and cellular automata?
[02:09:52.220 --> 02:09:55.800]   I mean, we've kind of implied through the discussion
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:57.320]   of physics underlying everything,
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:01.380]   but we talked about the potential equivalence
[02:10:01.380 --> 02:10:02.920]   of the fundamental laws of physics
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:06.200]   and the kind of computation going on in Turing machines,
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:08.800]   but can you now connect that,
[02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:11.640]   do you think there's something special or interesting
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:15.640]   about the kind of computation that our bodies do?
[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:19.040]   - Right, well, let's talk about brains primarily.
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:22.120]   I mean, I think the most important thing
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:23.920]   about the things that our brains do
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:25.500]   are that we care about them,
[02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:27.700]   in the sense that there's a lot of computation
[02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:31.000]   going on out there in cellular automata,
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.200]   in physical systems, and so on,
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:35.680]   and it just, it does what it does.
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:38.120]   It follows those rules, it does what it does.
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:40.080]   The thing that's special about the computation
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:44.200]   in our brains is that it's connected to our goals
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:47.180]   and our kind of whole societal story,
[02:10:47.180 --> 02:10:51.280]   and I think that's the special feature,
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:52.520]   and now the question then is,
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:53.960]   when you see this whole sort of ocean
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:57.160]   of computation out there, how do you connect that
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:10:59.440]   to the things that we humans care about?
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:01.480]   And in a sense, a large part of my life
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:03.120]   has been involved in sort of the technology
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:06.440]   of how to do that, and what I've been interested in
[02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:08.880]   is kind of building computational language
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:11.560]   that allows that something that both we humans
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:14.640]   can understand and that can be used
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:17.200]   to determine computations that are actually
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:19.240]   computations we care about.
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:20.840]   See, I think when you look at something
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:22.680]   like one of these cellular automata,
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:24.480]   and it does some complicated thing,
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:28.080]   you say, "That's fun, but why do I care?"
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:31.240]   Well, you could say the same thing, actually, in physics.
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:33.200]   You say, "Oh, I've got this material,
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:35.120]   "and it's a ferrite or something.
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:36.040]   "Why do I care?"
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:38.400]   You know, it has some magnetic properties.
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:39.240]   "Why do I care?
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:40.600]   "It's amusing, but why do I care?"
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:43.120]   Well, we end up caring because ferrite
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:44.720]   is what's used to make magnetic tape,
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:48.080]   magnetic disks, whatever, or we could use liquid crystals
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:51.240]   as made used to make, well, not actually,
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:53.000]   increasingly not, but it has been used
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.720]   to make computer displays and so on.
[02:11:55.720 --> 02:11:58.200]   But those are, so in a sense, we're mining
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:01.160]   these things that happen to exist in the physical universe
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:04.080]   and making it be something that we care about
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:06.760]   'cause we sort of entrain it into technology.
[02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:09.520]   And it's the same thing in the computational universe
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:11.720]   that a lot of what's out there
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:14.040]   is stuff that's just happening,
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:16.440]   but sometimes we have some objective,
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:19.120]   and we will go and sort of mine the computational universe
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:21.960]   for something that's useful for some particular objective.
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:24.320]   On a large scale, trying to do that,
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:27.080]   trying to sort of navigate the computational universe
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:29.120]   to do useful things, you know,
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:31.920]   that's where computational language comes in.
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:34.360]   And, you know, a lot of what I've spent time doing
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:37.200]   and building this thing we call Wolfram Language,
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:38.320]   which I've been building
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:41.480]   for the last one third of a century now.
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:46.480]   And kind of the goal there is to have a way to express
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:51.640]   kind of computational thinking, computational thoughts
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:54.200]   in a way that both humans and machines can understand.
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:58.320]   So it's kind of like in the tradition of computer languages,
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:00.000]   programming languages,
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.360]   that the tradition there has been more,
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:05.200]   let's take how computers are built,
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:09.040]   and let's specify, let's have a human way to specify,
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:10.600]   do this, do this, do this,
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:13.240]   at the level of the way that computers are built.
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:14.320]   What I've been interested in
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:18.120]   is representing sort of the whole world computationally,
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:19.560]   and being able to talk about
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:21.800]   whether it's about cities or chemicals,
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:23.600]   or, you know, this kind of algorithm
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:24.720]   or that kind of algorithm,
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:28.320]   things that have come to exist in our civilization
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:30.600]   and the sort of knowledge base of our civilization,
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:32.720]   being able to talk directly about those
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:34.440]   in a computational language
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:36.880]   so that both we can understand it
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:38.840]   and computers can understand it.
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:40.880]   I mean, the thing that I've been
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:42.160]   sort of excited about recently,
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:43.720]   which I had only realized recently,
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:44.880]   which is kind of embarrassing,
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:48.360]   but it's kind of the arc of what we've tried to do
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:50.920]   in building this kind of computational language
[02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:53.560]   is it's a similar kind of arc
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:57.400]   of what happened when mathematical notation was invented.
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:13:59.960]   So go back 400 years,
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:01.720]   people were trying to do math.
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:04.720]   They were always explaining their math in words,
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:06.520]   and it was pretty clunky.
[02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:09.880]   And as soon as mathematical notation was invented,
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:12.320]   you could start defining things like algebra
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:13.680]   and later calculus and so on.
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:15.760]   It all became much more streamlined.
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:19.080]   When we deal with computational thinking about the world,
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:20.600]   there's a question of what is the notation?
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:23.800]   What is the kind of formalism that we can use
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:26.520]   to talk about the world computationally?
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:28.240]   And in a sense, that's what I've spent
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:29.920]   the last third of a century trying to build,
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:31.120]   and we finally got to the point
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:34.320]   where we have a pretty full-scale computational language
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:36.480]   that sort of talks about the world.
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:40.320]   And that's exciting because it means that
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:42.920]   just like having this mathematical notation
[02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:45.520]   let us talk about the world mathematically,
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:47.840]   we now, and let us build up
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:49.880]   these kind of mathematical sciences.
[02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:52.240]   Now we have a computational language,
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:53.520]   which allows us to start talking
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:55.840]   about the world computationally,
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:57.640]   and lets us, you know, my view of it
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:01.360]   is it's kind of computational X for all X,
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:03.360]   all these different fields of, you know,
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:05.680]   computational this, computational that.
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:06.880]   That's what we can now build.
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:08.000]   - Let's step back.
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.540]   So first of all, the mundane,
[02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:16.480]   what is Wolfram language in terms of sort of,
[02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:18.280]   I mean, I can answer the question for you,
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:21.840]   but it's basically not the philosophical,
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:23.840]   deep, the profound, the impact of it.
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:25.640]   I'm talking about in terms of tools,
[02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:27.000]   in terms of things you can download,
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.120]   in terms of stuff you can play with, what is it?
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:31.360]   What does it fit into the infrastructure?
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:33.240]   What are the different ways to interact with it?
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:35.080]   - Right, so I mean, the two big things
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:37.640]   that people have sort of perhaps heard of
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:39.080]   that come from Wolfram language,
[02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:41.520]   one is Mathematica, the other is Wolfram Alpha.
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:44.560]   So Mathematica first came out in 1988.
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:47.440]   It's this system that is basically
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:50.640]   an instance of Wolfram language,
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:53.720]   and it's used to do computations,
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:56.280]   particularly in sort of technical areas.
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:58.920]   And the typical thing you're doing
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:02.360]   is you're typing little pieces of computational language,
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:04.560]   and you're getting computations done.
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:08.360]   - It's very kind of, there's like a symbolic.
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:10.440]   - Yeah, it's a symbolic language.
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:11.360]   - So it's a symbolic language,
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:13.960]   so I mean, I don't know how to cleanly express that,
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:15.440]   but that makes it very distinct
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:17.840]   from how we think about sort of,
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:20.440]   I don't know, programming in a language
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:21.520]   like Python or something.
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:23.640]   - Right, so the point is that
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:25.440]   in a traditional programming language,
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:27.920]   the raw material of the programming language
[02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:31.120]   is just stuff that computers intrinsically do.
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:33.640]   And the point of Wolfram language
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:36.840]   is that what the language is talking about
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:38.640]   is things that exist in the world
[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:41.240]   or things that we can imagine and construct,
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:43.880]   not, it's not sort of,
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:47.360]   it's aimed to be an abstract language from the beginning.
[02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:48.960]   And so, for example, one feature it has
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:50.840]   is that it's a symbolic language,
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:53.120]   which means that the thing called,
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:56.240]   you'd have an X, just type in X,
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:57.600]   and Wolfram language would just say,
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:58.840]   oh, that's X.
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:01.320]   It won't say error, undefined thing.
[02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:03.160]   I don't know what it is, computation,
[02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:05.600]   in terms of the internal computer.
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:10.560]   Now that X could perfectly well be the city of Boston.
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:13.080]   That's a thing, that's a symbolic thing.
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:14.720]   Or it could perfectly well be
[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:17.640]   the trajectory of some spacecraft
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:19.720]   represented as a symbolic thing.
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:24.280]   And that idea that one can work with,
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:26.840]   sort of computationally work with these different,
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:29.920]   these kinds of things that exist in the world
[02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:32.520]   or describe the world, that's really powerful.
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:36.800]   And that's what, I mean, when I started designing,
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:38.440]   well, when I designed the predecessor
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:41.360]   of what's now Wolfram language,
[02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:42.520]   which is a thing called SMP,
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:44.360]   which was my first computer language,
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:49.680]   I kind of wanted to have this sort of infrastructure
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:52.200]   for computation, which was as fundamental as possible.
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:54.520]   I mean, this is what I got for having been a physicist
[02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:58.080]   and tried to find fundamental components of things
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:00.480]   and wound up with this kind of idea
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:04.080]   of transformation rules for symbolic expressions
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:07.400]   as being sort of the underlying stuff
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:09.480]   from which computation would be built.
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:13.800]   And that's what we've been building from in Wolfram language
[02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:16.800]   and operationally what happens,
[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:20.080]   it's, I would say by far the highest level
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:22.920]   computer language that exists.
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:26.080]   And it's really been built in a very different direction
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:27.280]   from other languages.
[02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:30.240]   So other languages have been about,
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:32.000]   there is a core language,
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.360]   it really is kind of wrapped around the operations
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:36.360]   that a computer intrinsically does.
[02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:39.680]   Maybe people add libraries for this or that,
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:41.080]   but the goal of Wolfram language
[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:45.120]   is to have the language itself be able to cover
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:46.840]   this sort of very broad range of things
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:47.760]   that show up in the world.
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:49.320]   And that means that, you know,
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:51.720]   there are 6,000 primitive functions
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:54.320]   in the Wolfram language that cover things.
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:56.800]   You know, I could probably pick a random here.
[02:18:56.800 --> 02:19:01.040]   I'm gonna pick just because, just for fun, I'll pick,
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:03.520]   let's take a random sample
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:07.480]   of all the things that we have here.
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:09.920]   So let's just say random sample of 10 of them
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:12.080]   and let's see what we get.
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:12.960]   Wow, okay.
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:15.760]   So these are really different things from-
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:16.960]   - These are all functions.
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:19.200]   - These are all functions, Boolean convert.
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:21.400]   Okay, that's a thing for converting
[02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:24.720]   between different types of Boolean expressions.
[02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:26.960]   - So for people just listening,
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:29.280]   Stephen typed in a random sample of names,
[02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:31.240]   so this is sampling from all function.
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:32.360]   How many you said there might be?
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:33.360]   - 6,000. - 6,000.
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:34.600]   From 6,000, 10 of them,
[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:37.800]   and there's a hilarious variety of them.
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:38.640]   - Yeah, right.
[02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:41.680]   Well, we've got things about dollar requester address
[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:43.320]   that has to do with interacting
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:47.560]   with the world of the cloud and so on,
[02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:50.440]   discrete wavelet data, spheroid-less.
[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:52.520]   - It's also graphical, sort of window-movable.
[02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:53.720]   - Yeah, yeah, window-movable.
[02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:55.440]   That's a user interface kind of thing.
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:58.400]   I want to pick another 10 'cause I think this is some, okay.
[02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:01.040]   So yeah, there's a lot of infrastructure stuff here
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:03.520]   that you see if you just start sampling at random,
[02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:05.280]   there's a lot of kind of infrastructural things.
[02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:07.560]   If you more, you know, if you more look at the-
[02:20:07.560 --> 02:20:09.040]   - Some of the exciting machine learning stuff
[02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:11.760]   you showed off, is that also in this pool?
[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:12.600]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:14.680]   I mean, you know, so one of those functions is,
[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:17.720]   like image identify is a function here.
[02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:19.240]   We just say image identify, I don't know.
[02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:21.240]   It's always good to, let's do this.
[02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:25.320]   Let's say current image and let's pick up an image,
[02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:26.160]   hopefully.
[02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:29.920]   - Tap that current image, accessing the webcam,
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:31.240]   took a picture of yourself.
[02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:33.720]   - Took a terrible picture, but anyway,
[02:20:33.720 --> 02:20:36.840]   we can say image identify, open square brackets,
[02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:39.640]   and then you just paste that picture in there.
[02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:41.960]   - Image identify function running on the picture.
[02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:44.440]   - Oh, and it says, oh wow, it says,
[02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:46.840]   I look like a plunger because I got this great big thing
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:47.680]   behind my head.
[02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:49.560]   - Classify, so this image identify classifies
[02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:51.840]   the most likely object in the image.
[02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:54.080]   And it says it's a plunger.
[02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:55.720]   - Okay, that's a bit embarrassing.
[02:20:55.720 --> 02:20:56.920]   Let's see what it does.
[02:20:56.920 --> 02:20:58.520]   And let's pick the top 10.
[02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:01.280]   Okay, well, it thinks there's a,
[02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:02.920]   oh, it thinks it's pretty unlikely
[02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:04.800]   that it's a primate, a hominid, a person.
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:06.160]   - 8% probability.
[02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:07.000]   - Yeah, that's bad.
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.160]   - A primate, 57, it's a plunger.
[02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:10.000]   - Yeah, well, so.
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.160]   - That hopefully will not give you an existential crisis.
[02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:17.160]   And then 8%, or I shouldn't say percent, but--
[02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:20.200]   - No, that's right, 8% that it's a hominid.
[02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:21.880]   And yeah, okay, it's really,
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:23.160]   I'm gonna do another one of these
[02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:25.160]   just 'cause I'm embarrassed that it,
[02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:28.320]   it didn't even see me at all.
[02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:29.360]   There we go, let's try that.
[02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:30.560]   Let's see what that did.
[02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:33.960]   - Retook a picture with a little bit more of your body.
[02:21:33.960 --> 02:21:36.120]   - A little bit more of me.
[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:38.400]   And not just my bald head, so to speak.
[02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:41.120]   Okay, 89% probability it's a person.
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:43.880]   So then I would, but, you know,
[02:21:43.880 --> 02:21:46.520]   so this is image identify as an example of one.
[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:47.560]   - Of just one of the many.
[02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:48.400]   - Just one function out of 6,000.
[02:21:48.400 --> 02:21:51.880]   - And that's part of the, that's like part of the language.
[02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:52.720]   - Part of the core language, yes.
[02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:55.080]   And I mean, you know, something like,
[02:21:55.080 --> 02:21:59.080]   I could say, I don't know, let's find the geo-nearest,
[02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:00.680]   what could we find?
[02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:02.920]   Let's find the nearest volcano.
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:09.240]   Let's find the 10, I wonder where it thinks here is.
[02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:13.920]   Let's try finding the 10 volcanoes nearest here, okay?
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:14.760]   So let's give it a--
[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:18.520]   - So geo-nearest volcano here, 10 nearest volcanoes.
[02:22:18.520 --> 02:22:19.800]   - Right, let's find out where those are.
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:21.920]   We can now, we got a list of volcanoes out
[02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:25.040]   and I can say geo-list plot that,
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:26.680]   and hopefully, okay, so there we go.
[02:22:26.680 --> 02:22:29.520]   So there's a map that shows the positions
[02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:30.880]   of those 10 volcanoes.
[02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:32.800]   - Of the East Coast and the Midwest,
[02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:34.880]   and it's the, well, no, we're okay, we're okay.
[02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:36.040]   There's not, it's not too bad.
[02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:37.240]   - Yeah, they're not very close to us.
[02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:39.440]   We could measure how far away they are.
[02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:42.840]   But, you know, the fact that right in the language,
[02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:45.280]   it knows about all the volcanoes in the world,
[02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:48.280]   it knows, you know, computing what the nearest ones are,
[02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:50.120]   it knows all the maps of the world and so on.
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:52.200]   - It's a fundamentally different idea of what a language is.
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:53.040]   - Yeah, right.
[02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:55.320]   That's why I like to talk about as a, you know,
[02:22:55.320 --> 02:22:57.040]   a full-scale computational language.
[02:22:57.040 --> 02:22:58.520]   That's what we've tried to do.
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:00.760]   - And just if you can comment briefly, I mean,
[02:23:00.760 --> 02:23:03.880]   this kind of, the Wolfram language,
[02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:06.680]   along with Wolfram Alpha, represents kind of what the dream
[02:23:06.680 --> 02:23:08.520]   of what AI is supposed to be.
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:11.560]   There's now a sort of a craze of learning,
[02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:14.400]   kind of idea that we can take raw data
[02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:18.320]   and from that extract the different hierarchies
[02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:21.360]   of abstractions in order to be able to,
[02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:23.080]   like in order to form the kind of things
[02:23:23.080 --> 02:23:27.480]   that Wolfram language operates with.
[02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:29.920]   But we're very far from learning systems
[02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:31.720]   being able to form that.
[02:23:31.720 --> 02:23:32.560]   - Right.
[02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:35.320]   - Like the context of history of AI,
[02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:38.160]   if you could just comment on, there is,
[02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:40.160]   you said computation X.
[02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:43.240]   And there's just some sense where in the 80s and 90s,
[02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:45.280]   sort of expert systems represented
[02:23:45.280 --> 02:23:47.200]   a very particular computation X.
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:48.040]   - Yes.
[02:23:48.040 --> 02:23:49.460]   - Right, and there's a kind of notion
[02:23:49.460 --> 02:23:53.240]   that those efforts didn't pan out.
[02:23:53.240 --> 02:23:54.080]   - Right.
[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:57.680]   - But then out of that emerges kind of Wolfram language,
[02:23:57.680 --> 02:24:00.320]   Wolfram Alpha, which is the success, I mean.
[02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:01.640]   - Yeah, right, I think those are,
[02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:04.240]   in some sense, those efforts were too modest.
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:05.080]   - Right, exactly.
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:07.480]   - They were looking at particular areas
[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:09.800]   and you actually can't do it with a particular area.
[02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:11.120]   I mean, like even a problem
[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:12.920]   like natural language understanding,
[02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:15.160]   it's critical to have broad knowledge of the world
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:17.800]   if you want to do good natural language understanding.
[02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:20.280]   And you kind of have to bite off the whole problem.
[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:23.360]   If you say we're just gonna do the blocks world over here,
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:25.520]   so to speak, you don't really,
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:27.800]   it's actually, it's one of these cases
[02:24:27.800 --> 02:24:29.400]   where it's easier to do the whole thing
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:30.840]   than it is to do some piece of it.
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:32.400]   You know, one comment to make about,
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:35.040]   so the relationship between what we've tried to do
[02:24:35.040 --> 02:24:37.820]   and sort of the learning side of AI,
[02:24:37.820 --> 02:24:40.760]   you know, in a sense, if you look at the development
[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:43.200]   of knowledge in our civilization as a whole,
[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:47.160]   there was kind of this notion pre 300 years ago or so now,
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:48.760]   you want to figure something out about the world,
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:50.040]   you can reason it out.
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:54.000]   You can do things which just use raw human thought.
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:57.560]   And then along came sort of modern mathematical science.
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:25:01.080]   And we found ways to just sort of blast through that
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:03.560]   by in that case, writing down equations.
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:07.020]   Now we also know we can do that with computation and so on.
[02:25:07.020 --> 02:25:08.920]   And so that was kind of a different thing.
[02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:13.000]   So when we look at how do we sort of encode knowledge
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:14.440]   and figure things out,
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:16.600]   one way we could do it is start from scratch,
[02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:17.900]   learn everything,
[02:25:17.900 --> 02:25:20.800]   it's just a neural net figuring everything out.
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:24.120]   But in a sense that denies the sort of knowledge
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:26.300]   based achievements of our civilization,
[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:29.480]   because in our civilization, we have learned lots of stuff.
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:31.360]   We've surveyed all the volcanoes in the world,
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:32.440]   we've done, you know,
[02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:35.520]   we figured out lots of algorithms for this or that.
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:38.800]   Those are things that we can encode computationally.
[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:40.480]   And that's what we've tried to do.
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:42.260]   And we're not saying just,
[02:25:42.260 --> 02:25:44.420]   you don't have to start everything from scratch.
[02:25:44.420 --> 02:25:46.960]   So in a sense, a big part of what we've done
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:50.760]   is to try and sort of capture the knowledge of the world
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:53.340]   in computational form and computable form.
[02:25:53.340 --> 02:25:55.480]   Now, there's also some pieces,
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:59.360]   which were for a long time undoable by computers
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:01.140]   like image identification,
[02:26:01.140 --> 02:26:03.920]   where there's a really, really useful module
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:06.440]   that we can add that is those things
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:09.060]   which actually were pretty easy for humans to do
[02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:10.960]   that had been hard for computers to do.
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:13.460]   I think the thing that's interesting that's emerging now
[02:26:13.460 --> 02:26:14.960]   is the interplay between these things,
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:17.040]   between this kind of knowledge of the world
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:19.240]   that is in a sense very symbolic
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:22.880]   and this kind of sort of much more statistical
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:27.480]   kind of things like image identification and so on,
[02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:29.000]   and putting those together
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.320]   by having this sort of symbolic representation
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:33.500]   of image identification,
[02:26:33.500 --> 02:26:35.800]   that that's where things get really interesting
[02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:38.380]   and where you can kind of symbolically represent patterns
[02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:40.740]   of things and images and so on.
[02:26:40.740 --> 02:26:42.260]   I think that's, you know,
[02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:45.240]   that's kind of a part of the path forward, so to speak.
[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:46.360]   - Yeah, so the dream of,
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:49.280]   so the machine learning is not,
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:51.360]   in my view, I think the view of many people
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:56.360]   is not anywhere close to building the kind of wide world
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:27:00.120]   of computable knowledge that Wolfram Language have built,
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:03.400]   but because you have a kind of,
[02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:06.560]   you've done the incredibly hard work of building this world,
[02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:09.400]   now machine learning can be,
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:12.440]   can serve as tools to help you explore that world.
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:13.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:14.800]   - And that's what you've added, I mean,
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:16.160]   version 12, right?
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:18.560]   You added a few, I was seeing some demos,
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:20.320]   it looks amazing.
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:21.640]   - Right, I mean, I think, you know,
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:24.680]   this, it's sort of interesting to see the,
[02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:28.000]   the sort of the, once it's computable,
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:28.840]   once it's in there,
[02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:32.040]   it's running in sort of a very efficient computational way,
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:33.920]   but then there's sort of things like the interface
[02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:35.000]   of how do you get there, you know,
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.160]   how do you do natural language understanding to get there?
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:39.120]   How do you pick out entities
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:40.920]   in a big piece of text or something?
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:44.520]   That's, I mean, actually a good example right now
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:46.800]   is our NLP, NLU loop,
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:48.720]   which is we've done a lot of stuff,
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:50.480]   natural language understanding,
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:53.160]   using essentially not learning-based methods,
[02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:54.640]   using a lot of, you know,
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:56.960]   little algorithmic methods,
[02:27:56.960 --> 02:27:58.480]   human curation methods, and so on.
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:01.200]   - In terms of when people try to enter a query
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:04.120]   and then converting, so the process of converting,
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:09.120]   NLU defined beautifully as converting their query
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:11.960]   into a computational language,
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:13.680]   which is a very well,
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:16.240]   first of all, a super practical definition,
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:17.480]   a very useful definition,
[02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:20.280]   and then also a very clear definition
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:21.920]   of natural language understanding.
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:23.320]   - Right, I mean, a different thing
[02:28:23.320 --> 02:28:24.720]   is natural language processing,
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:27.440]   where it's like, here's a big lump of text,
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:30.480]   go pick out all the cities in that text, for example.
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:32.800]   And so a good example of, you know, so we do that,
[02:28:32.800 --> 02:28:36.240]   we're using modern machine learning techniques.
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:39.640]   And it's actually kind of an interesting process
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:40.600]   that's going on right now,
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:43.200]   is this loop between what do we pick up
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:45.800]   with NLP, we're using machine learning,
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:48.000]   versus what do we pick up with our more
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.240]   kind of precise computational methods
[02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:51.960]   in natural language understanding.
[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:53.960]   And so we've got this kind of loop going between those,
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:55.600]   which is improving both of them.
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:56.600]   - Yeah, and I think you have some
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:28:57.800]   of the state-of-the-art transformers,
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:28:59.160]   like you have BERT in there, I think.
[02:28:59.160 --> 02:29:00.000]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:00.920]   - So it's cool, so you have,
[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:02.360]   you're integrating all the models.
[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:04.800]   I mean, this is the hybrid thing
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:07.720]   that people have always dreamed about or talking about.
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:11.080]   I'm actually just surprised, frankly,
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:13.120]   that Wolfram Language is not more popular
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:15.400]   than it already is.
[02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:19.480]   - You know, that's a, it's a complicated issue,
[02:29:19.480 --> 02:29:24.480]   because it's like, it involves, you know,
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:28.600]   it involves ideas, and ideas are absorbed slowly
[02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:29.440]   in the world.
[02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:30.280]   I mean, I think that's--
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:32.160]   - And then there's sort of, like what we're talking about,
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:33.720]   there's egos and personalities,
[02:29:33.720 --> 02:29:38.400]   and some of the absorption mechanisms
[02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:41.240]   of ideas have to do with personalities,
[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:43.320]   and the students of personalities,
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:45.520]   and then a little social network.
[02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:48.520]   So it's interesting how the spread of ideas works.
[02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:50.400]   - You know what's funny with Wolfram Language,
[02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:53.400]   is that we are, if you say, you know,
[02:29:53.400 --> 02:29:55.880]   what market, sort of market penetration,
[02:29:55.880 --> 02:29:59.920]   if you look at the, I would say, very high-end of R&D,
[02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:02.280]   and sort of the people where you say,
[02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:06.020]   "Wow, that's a really, you know, impressive, smart person,"
[02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:08.300]   they're very often users of Wolfram Language,
[02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:09.720]   very, very often.
[02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:12.400]   If you look at the more sort of, it's a funny thing,
[02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:14.960]   if you look at the more kind of, I would say,
[02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:17.160]   people who are like, "Oh, we're just plodding away,
[02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:20.920]   "doing what we do," they're often not yet
[02:30:20.920 --> 02:30:23.160]   Wolfram Language users, and that dynamic,
[02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:24.600]   it's kind of odd that there hasn't been
[02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:27.200]   more rapid trickle-down, because we really,
[02:30:27.200 --> 02:30:30.280]   you know, the high-end, we've really been very successful
[02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:34.700]   in for a long time, and it's, but with, you know,
[02:30:34.700 --> 02:30:38.500]   that's partly, I think, a consequence of,
[02:30:38.500 --> 02:30:41.320]   my fault, in a sense, because it's kind of, you know,
[02:30:41.320 --> 02:30:45.260]   I have a company which is, really emphasizes
[02:30:45.260 --> 02:30:50.260]   sort of creating products and building a,
[02:30:50.260 --> 02:30:53.460]   sort of the best possible technical tower we can,
[02:30:53.460 --> 02:30:57.200]   rather than sort of doing the commercial side of things
[02:30:57.200 --> 02:31:00.040]   and pumping it out in sort of the most effective way.
[02:31:00.040 --> 02:31:01.920]   - And there's an interesting idea that, you know,
[02:31:01.920 --> 02:31:03.420]   perhaps you can make it more popular
[02:31:03.420 --> 02:31:07.880]   by opening everything up, sort of the GitHub model,
[02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:10.040]   but there's an interesting, I think I've heard you
[02:31:10.040 --> 02:31:12.940]   discuss this, that that turns out not to work
[02:31:12.940 --> 02:31:15.480]   in a lot of cases, like in this particular case,
[02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:18.720]   that you want it, that when you deeply care
[02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:23.720]   about the integrity, the quality of the knowledge
[02:31:23.720 --> 02:31:27.400]   that you're building, that unfortunately,
[02:31:27.400 --> 02:31:30.420]   you can't distribute that effort.
[02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:34.660]   - Yeah, it's not the nature of how things work.
[02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:36.860]   I mean, you know, what we're trying to do
[02:31:36.860 --> 02:31:38.960]   is a thing that, for better or worse,
[02:31:38.960 --> 02:31:41.700]   requires leadership and it requires kind of
[02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:45.320]   maintaining a coherent vision over a long period of time
[02:31:45.320 --> 02:31:49.620]   and doing not only the cool vision-related work,
[02:31:49.620 --> 02:31:52.720]   but also the kind of mundane in the trenches,
[02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:54.980]   make the thing actually work well, work.
[02:31:54.980 --> 02:31:57.380]   - So how do you build the knowledge?
[02:31:57.380 --> 02:31:58.820]   Because that's the fascinating thing.
[02:31:58.820 --> 02:32:01.900]   That's the mundane, the fascinating and the mundane,
[02:32:01.900 --> 02:32:04.100]   is building the knowledge, the adding,
[02:32:04.100 --> 02:32:05.180]   integrating more data.
[02:32:05.180 --> 02:32:07.300]   - Yeah, I mean, that's probably not the most,
[02:32:07.300 --> 02:32:09.460]   I mean, the things like get it to work
[02:32:09.460 --> 02:32:12.120]   in all these different cloud environments and so on.
[02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:14.560]   That's pretty, you know, that's very practical stuff.
[02:32:14.560 --> 02:32:16.500]   You know, have the user interface be smooth
[02:32:16.500 --> 02:32:20.260]   and have there be, take only a fraction of a millisecond
[02:32:20.260 --> 02:32:21.500]   to do this or that.
[02:32:21.500 --> 02:32:22.820]   That's a lot of work.
[02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:27.820]   And it's, but, you know, I think my,
[02:32:28.140 --> 02:32:30.060]   it's an interesting thing over the period of time,
[02:32:30.060 --> 02:32:33.260]   you know, orphan language has existed basically
[02:32:33.260 --> 02:32:35.580]   for more than half of the total amount of time
[02:32:35.580 --> 02:32:37.940]   that any language, any computer language has existed.
[02:32:37.940 --> 02:32:41.300]   That is, computer language is maybe 60 years old,
[02:32:41.300 --> 02:32:43.660]   you know, give or take,
[02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:46.180]   and orphan language is 33 years old.
[02:32:46.180 --> 02:32:50.860]   So it's kind of a, and I think I was realizing recently
[02:32:50.860 --> 02:32:54.580]   there's been more innovation in the distribution of software
[02:32:54.580 --> 02:32:57.700]   than probably than in the structure of programming languages
[02:32:57.700 --> 02:32:59.180]   over that period of time.
[02:32:59.180 --> 02:33:03.180]   And we, you know, we've been sort of trying to do our best
[02:33:03.180 --> 02:33:04.020]   to adapt to it.
[02:33:04.020 --> 02:33:06.140]   And the good news is that we have, you know,
[02:33:06.140 --> 02:33:08.900]   because I have a simple private company and so on
[02:33:08.900 --> 02:33:11.380]   that doesn't have, you know, a bunch of investors,
[02:33:11.380 --> 02:33:13.860]   you know, telling us we're gonna do this or that,
[02:33:13.860 --> 02:33:15.700]   they have lots of freedom in what we can do.
[02:33:15.700 --> 02:33:18.940]   And so, for example, we're able to, oh, I don't know,
[02:33:18.940 --> 02:33:21.100]   we have this free Wolfram Engine for developers,
[02:33:21.100 --> 02:33:22.940]   which is a free version for developers.
[02:33:22.940 --> 02:33:24.660]   And we've been, you know, we've,
[02:33:24.660 --> 02:33:27.540]   there are site licenses for Mathematica
[02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:30.220]   and Wolfram Language at basically all major universities,
[02:33:30.220 --> 02:33:32.340]   certainly in the US by now.
[02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:34.380]   So it's effectively free to people
[02:33:34.380 --> 02:33:37.260]   and all the universities in effect.
[02:33:37.260 --> 02:33:40.840]   And, you know, we've been doing a progression of things.
[02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:43.720]   I mean, different things like Wolfram Alpha, for example,
[02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:46.540]   the main website is just a free website.
[02:33:46.540 --> 02:33:48.220]   - What is Wolfram Alpha?
[02:33:48.220 --> 02:33:51.860]   - Okay, Wolfram Alpha is a system for answering questions
[02:33:51.860 --> 02:33:55.460]   where you ask a question with natural language
[02:33:55.460 --> 02:33:57.460]   and it'll try and generate a report
[02:33:57.460 --> 02:33:58.820]   telling you the answer to that question.
[02:33:58.820 --> 02:34:02.580]   So the question could be something like, you know,
[02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:06.660]   what's the population of Boston divided by New York
[02:34:06.660 --> 02:34:07.540]   compared to New York?
[02:34:07.540 --> 02:34:11.700]   And it'll take those words and give you an answer.
[02:34:11.700 --> 02:34:12.540]   And that have been--
[02:34:12.540 --> 02:34:16.380]   - Converts the words into computable, into--
[02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:17.540]   - Into Wolfram Language, actually.
[02:34:17.540 --> 02:34:18.620]   - Into Wolfram Language.
[02:34:18.620 --> 02:34:20.500]   - And then computational language and then--
[02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:22.580]   - Do you think the underlying knowledge
[02:34:22.580 --> 02:34:25.500]   belongs to Wolfram Alpha or to the Wolfram Language?
[02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:26.340]   What's the--
[02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:27.900]   - We just call it the Wolfram Knowledge Base.
[02:34:27.900 --> 02:34:28.720]   - Knowledge Base.
[02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:32.380]   - I mean, that's been a big effort over the decades
[02:34:32.380 --> 02:34:33.580]   to collect all that stuff.
[02:34:33.580 --> 02:34:36.580]   And, you know, more of it flows in every second, so.
[02:34:36.580 --> 02:34:38.460]   - Can you just pause on that for a second?
[02:34:38.460 --> 02:34:41.500]   Like, that's one of the most incredible things.
[02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:45.720]   Of course, in the long-term, Wolfram Language itself
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:47.420]   is the fundamental thing.
[02:34:47.420 --> 02:34:50.620]   But in the amazing sort of short-term,
[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:53.740]   the knowledge base is kind of incredible.
[02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:57.540]   So what's the process of building that knowledge base?
[02:34:57.540 --> 02:34:59.600]   The fact that you, first of all, from the very beginning,
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:01.380]   that you're brave enough to start,
[02:35:01.380 --> 02:35:04.400]   to take on the general knowledge base.
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:08.420]   And how do you go from zero
[02:35:08.420 --> 02:35:11.420]   to the incredible knowledge base that you have now?
[02:35:11.420 --> 02:35:13.300]   - Well, yeah, it was kind of scary at some level.
[02:35:13.300 --> 02:35:15.820]   I mean, I had wondered about doing something like this
[02:35:15.820 --> 02:35:17.060]   since I was a kid.
[02:35:17.060 --> 02:35:19.100]   So it wasn't like I hadn't thought about it for a while.
[02:35:19.100 --> 02:35:22.980]   - But most of us, most of the brilliant dreamers
[02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:27.100]   give up such a difficult engineering notion at some point.
[02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:28.300]   - Right, right.
[02:35:28.300 --> 02:35:30.980]   Well, the thing that happened with me, which was kind of,
[02:35:30.980 --> 02:35:34.740]   it's a live-your-own-paradigm kind of theory.
[02:35:34.740 --> 02:35:36.660]   So basically what happened is,
[02:35:36.660 --> 02:35:40.020]   I had assumed that to build something like Wolfram Alpha
[02:35:40.020 --> 02:35:42.980]   would require sort of solving the general AI problem.
[02:35:42.980 --> 02:35:44.580]   That's what I had assumed.
[02:35:44.580 --> 02:35:46.340]   And so I kept on thinking about that,
[02:35:46.340 --> 02:35:47.980]   and I thought I don't really know how to do that,
[02:35:47.980 --> 02:35:49.660]   so I don't do anything.
[02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:52.460]   Then I worked on my new kind of science project
[02:35:52.460 --> 02:35:54.660]   and sort of exploring the computational universe
[02:35:54.660 --> 02:35:55.780]   and came up with things like
[02:35:55.780 --> 02:35:57.780]   this principle of computational equivalence,
[02:35:57.780 --> 02:36:01.420]   which say there is no bright line between the intelligent
[02:36:01.420 --> 02:36:02.940]   and the merely computational.
[02:36:02.940 --> 02:36:06.020]   So I thought, look, that's this paradigm I've built.
[02:36:06.020 --> 02:36:10.660]   Now I have to eat that dog food myself, so to speak.
[02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:12.220]   I've been thinking about doing this thing
[02:36:12.220 --> 02:36:14.340]   with computable knowledge forever,
[02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:16.980]   and let me actually try and do it.
[02:36:16.980 --> 02:36:20.460]   And so it was, if my paradigm is right,
[02:36:20.460 --> 02:36:22.100]   then this should be possible.
[02:36:22.100 --> 02:36:23.820]   But the beginning was certainly,
[02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:24.660]   it was a bit daunting.
[02:36:24.660 --> 02:36:29.340]   I remember I took the early team to a big reference library
[02:36:29.340 --> 02:36:30.940]   and we're looking at this reference library,
[02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:33.540]   and it's like, my basic statement is,
[02:36:33.540 --> 02:36:35.300]   our goal over the next year or two
[02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:38.060]   is to ingest everything that's in here.
[02:36:38.060 --> 02:36:41.340]   And that's, it seemed very daunting,
[02:36:41.340 --> 02:36:43.940]   but in a sense I was well aware of the fact
[02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:45.180]   that it's finite.
[02:36:45.180 --> 02:36:46.780]   The fact that you can walk into the reference library,
[02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:49.220]   it's a big, big thing with lots of reference books
[02:36:49.220 --> 02:36:51.820]   all over the place, but it is finite.
[02:36:51.820 --> 02:36:53.580]   This is not an infinite,
[02:36:53.580 --> 02:36:56.740]   it's not the infinite corridor of, so to speak,
[02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:57.660]   of reference library.
[02:36:57.660 --> 02:36:59.700]   It's not truly infinite, so to speak.
[02:36:59.700 --> 02:37:02.580]   But no, I mean, and then what happened
[02:37:02.580 --> 02:37:04.340]   was sort of interesting there was,
[02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:07.140]   from a methodology point of view,
[02:37:07.140 --> 02:37:09.260]   was I didn't start off saying,
[02:37:09.260 --> 02:37:10.620]   let me have a grand theory
[02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:12.660]   for how all this knowledge works.
[02:37:12.660 --> 02:37:15.620]   It was like, let's implement this area,
[02:37:15.620 --> 02:37:18.900]   this area, this area, a few hundred areas and so on.
[02:37:18.900 --> 02:37:20.500]   That's a lot of work.
[02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:21.820]   I also found that,
[02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:27.340]   I've been fortunate in that our products
[02:37:27.340 --> 02:37:31.820]   get used by sort of the world's experts in lots of areas.
[02:37:31.820 --> 02:37:33.380]   And so that really helped
[02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:35.980]   'cause we were able to ask people,
[02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:37.740]   the world expert in this or that,
[02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:40.220]   and we're able to ask them for input and so on.
[02:37:40.220 --> 02:37:43.380]   And I found that my general principle was
[02:37:43.380 --> 02:37:46.300]   that any area where there wasn't some expert
[02:37:46.300 --> 02:37:50.180]   who helped us figure out what to do wouldn't be right.
[02:37:50.180 --> 02:37:52.140]   'Cause our goal was to kind of get to the point
[02:37:52.140 --> 02:37:54.940]   where we had sort of true expert level knowledge
[02:37:54.940 --> 02:37:56.380]   about everything.
[02:37:56.380 --> 02:37:59.060]   And so that the ultimate goal is,
[02:37:59.060 --> 02:38:01.060]   if there's a question that can be answered
[02:38:01.060 --> 02:38:03.740]   on the basis of general knowledge in our civilization,
[02:38:03.740 --> 02:38:06.820]   make it be automatic to be able to answer that question.
[02:38:06.820 --> 02:38:10.900]   And now, well, WolfMalpha got used in Siri
[02:38:10.900 --> 02:38:13.660]   from the very beginning and it's now also used in Alexa.
[02:38:13.660 --> 02:38:17.220]   And so it's people are kind of getting more of the,
[02:38:17.220 --> 02:38:20.020]   they get more of the sense of this is
[02:38:20.020 --> 02:38:21.980]   what should be possible to do.
[02:38:21.980 --> 02:38:24.900]   I mean, in a sense, the question answering problem
[02:38:24.900 --> 02:38:27.500]   was viewed as one of the sort of core AI problems
[02:38:27.500 --> 02:38:28.460]   for a long time.
[02:38:28.460 --> 02:38:30.820]   I had kind of an interesting experience.
[02:38:30.820 --> 02:38:33.340]   I had a friend Marvin Minsky,
[02:38:33.340 --> 02:38:38.100]   who was a well-known AI person from right around here.
[02:38:38.100 --> 02:38:40.580]   And I remember when WolfMalpha was coming out,
[02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:44.020]   it was a few weeks before it came out, I think,
[02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:46.380]   I happened to see Marvin and I said,
[02:38:46.380 --> 02:38:48.260]   "I should show you this thing we have.
[02:38:48.260 --> 02:38:50.180]   It's a question answering system."
[02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:52.700]   And he was like, "Okay."
[02:38:52.700 --> 02:38:54.860]   Typed something in, it's like, "Okay, fine."
[02:38:54.860 --> 02:38:56.900]   And then he's talking about something different.
[02:38:56.900 --> 02:39:01.220]   I said, "No, Marvin, this time it actually works.
[02:39:01.220 --> 02:39:02.740]   Look at this, it actually works."
[02:39:02.740 --> 02:39:04.340]   He types in a few more things.
[02:39:04.340 --> 02:39:05.980]   There's maybe 10 more things.
[02:39:05.980 --> 02:39:07.660]   Of course, we have a record of what he typed in,
[02:39:07.660 --> 02:39:09.060]   which is kind of interesting.
[02:39:09.060 --> 02:39:16.740]   - Can you share where his mind was in the testing space?
[02:39:16.740 --> 02:39:17.860]   - All kinds of random things.
[02:39:17.860 --> 02:39:19.540]   He was just trying random stuff,
[02:39:19.540 --> 02:39:24.540]   medical stuff and chemistry stuff and astronomy and so on.
[02:39:24.540 --> 02:39:28.060]   And it was like, after a few minutes, he was like,
[02:39:28.060 --> 02:39:30.460]   "Oh my God, it actually works."
[02:39:32.180 --> 02:39:35.580]   But that was kind of told you something about the state,
[02:39:35.580 --> 02:39:38.700]   what happened in AI, because people had,
[02:39:38.700 --> 02:39:41.620]   in a sense, by trying to solve the bigger problem,
[02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:43.420]   we were able to actually make something that would work.
[02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:45.300]   Now, to be fair,
[02:39:45.300 --> 02:39:47.700]   we had a bunch of completely unfair advantages.
[02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:50.660]   For example, we already built a bunch of orphan language,
[02:39:50.660 --> 02:39:54.100]   which was very high level symbolic language.
[02:39:54.100 --> 02:39:59.500]   I had the practical experience of building big systems.
[02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:03.140]   I have the sort of intellectual confidence
[02:40:03.140 --> 02:40:06.860]   to not just sort of give up in doing something like this.
[02:40:06.860 --> 02:40:07.980]   I think that the,
[02:40:07.980 --> 02:40:12.500]   it's always a funny thing.
[02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:14.500]   I've worked on a bunch of big projects in my life.
[02:40:14.500 --> 02:40:19.180]   And I would say that the, you mentioned ego,
[02:40:19.180 --> 02:40:21.380]   I would also mention optimism, so to speak.
[02:40:21.380 --> 02:40:24.580]   I mean, if somebody said,
[02:40:24.580 --> 02:40:26.780]   "This project is gonna take 30 years,"
[02:40:30.540 --> 02:40:33.100]   it would be hard to sell me on that.
[02:40:33.100 --> 02:40:34.860]   I'm always in the,
[02:40:34.860 --> 02:40:37.300]   well, I can kind of see a few years,
[02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:39.540]   something's gonna happen in a few years.
[02:40:39.540 --> 02:40:41.940]   And usually it does, something happens in a few years,
[02:40:41.940 --> 02:40:45.100]   but the whole, the tale can be decades long.
[02:40:45.100 --> 02:40:47.020]   And that's a,
[02:40:47.020 --> 02:40:48.180]   and from a personal point of view,
[02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:50.860]   always the challenge is you end up with these projects
[02:40:50.860 --> 02:40:52.700]   that have infinite tales.
[02:40:52.700 --> 02:40:55.740]   And the question is, do the tales kind of,
[02:40:55.740 --> 02:40:57.820]   do you just drown in kind of dealing
[02:40:57.820 --> 02:40:59.940]   with all of the tales of these projects?
[02:41:00.540 --> 02:41:04.420]   And that's an interesting sort of personal challenge.
[02:41:04.420 --> 02:41:06.900]   And like my efforts now to work
[02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:08.140]   on fundamental theory of physics,
[02:41:08.140 --> 02:41:09.780]   which I've just started doing,
[02:41:09.780 --> 02:41:12.740]   and I'm having a lot of fun with it,
[02:41:12.740 --> 02:41:17.740]   but it's kind of making a bet that I can kind of,
[02:41:17.740 --> 02:41:22.260]   I can do that as well as doing the incredibly
[02:41:22.260 --> 02:41:24.180]   energetic things that I'm trying to do
[02:41:24.180 --> 02:41:25.860]   with orphan language and so on.
[02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:27.140]   I mean, the vision, yeah.
[02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:28.540]   - And underlying that, I mean,
[02:41:28.540 --> 02:41:31.620]   I just talked for the second time with Elon Musk
[02:41:31.620 --> 02:41:35.860]   and you two share that quality a little bit of that optimism
[02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:39.540]   of taking on basically the daunting,
[02:41:39.540 --> 02:41:42.660]   what most people call impossible,
[02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:46.020]   and he, and you take it on out of,
[02:41:46.020 --> 02:41:48.620]   you can call it ego, you can call it naivety,
[02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:50.780]   you can call it optimism, whatever the heck it is,
[02:41:50.780 --> 02:41:53.020]   but that's how you solve the impossible things.
[02:41:53.020 --> 02:41:55.020]   - Yeah, I mean, look, what happens,
[02:41:55.020 --> 02:41:58.300]   and I don't know, you know, in my own case,
[02:41:58.300 --> 02:42:00.940]   you know, it's been, I progressively got
[02:42:00.940 --> 02:42:03.740]   a bit more confident and progressively able to,
[02:42:03.740 --> 02:42:06.100]   you know, decide that these projects aren't crazy,
[02:42:06.100 --> 02:42:09.500]   but then the other thing is, the other trap
[02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:11.060]   that one can end up with is,
[02:42:11.060 --> 02:42:13.860]   oh, I've done these projects and they're big,
[02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:15.780]   let me never do a project that's any smaller
[02:42:15.780 --> 02:42:17.420]   than any project I've done so far.
[02:42:17.420 --> 02:42:18.260]   (laughing)
[02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:20.580]   And that's, you know, and that can be a trap.
[02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:25.260]   And often these projects are of completely unknown,
[02:42:25.260 --> 02:42:27.660]   you know, their depth and significance
[02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:29.820]   is actually very hard to know.
[02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:35.100]   - On the, sort of building this giant knowledge base
[02:42:35.100 --> 02:42:38.120]   that's behind Wolfram Language, Wolfram Alpha,
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:43.380]   what do you think about the internet?
[02:42:43.380 --> 02:42:46.920]   What do you think about, for example, Wikipedia,
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:50.700]   these large aggregations of text
[02:42:50.700 --> 02:42:53.540]   that's not converted into computable knowledge?
[02:42:53.540 --> 02:42:56.700]   Do you think, if you look at Wolfram Language,
[02:42:56.700 --> 02:43:00.860]   Wolfram Alpha, 20, 30, maybe 50 years down the line,
[02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:05.460]   do you hope to store all of the,
[02:43:05.460 --> 02:43:07.420]   sort of Google's dream is to make
[02:43:07.420 --> 02:43:10.560]   all information searchable, accessible,
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:13.180]   but that's really, as defined,
[02:43:13.180 --> 02:43:17.620]   it doesn't include the understanding of information.
[02:43:17.620 --> 02:43:18.460]   - Right.
[02:43:18.460 --> 02:43:22.020]   - Do you hope to make all of knowledge
[02:43:22.020 --> 02:43:25.620]   represented within-- - Sure, I would hope so.
[02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:26.740]   That's what we're trying to do.
[02:43:26.740 --> 02:43:29.780]   - How hard is that problem, like closing that gap?
[02:43:29.780 --> 02:43:30.820]   - What's your sense? - Well, it depends
[02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:31.700]   on the use cases.
[02:43:31.700 --> 02:43:33.140]   I mean, so if it's a question
[02:43:33.140 --> 02:43:35.600]   of answering general knowledge questions about the world,
[02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:37.840]   we're in pretty good shape on that right now.
[02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:41.700]   If it's a question of representing,
[02:43:41.700 --> 02:43:44.180]   like an area that we're going into right now
[02:43:44.180 --> 02:43:46.100]   is computational contracts,
[02:43:46.100 --> 02:43:48.020]   being able to take something
[02:43:48.020 --> 02:43:50.180]   which would be written in legalese,
[02:43:50.180 --> 02:43:52.180]   it might even be the specifications for, you know,
[02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:53.860]   what should the self-driving car do
[02:43:53.860 --> 02:43:55.780]   when it encounters this or that or the other?
[02:43:55.780 --> 02:43:58.060]   What should the, you know, whatever.
[02:43:58.060 --> 02:44:01.860]   Then, you know, write that in a computational language
[02:44:01.860 --> 02:44:04.540]   and be able to express things about the world.
[02:44:04.540 --> 02:44:06.380]   You know, if the creature that you see
[02:44:06.380 --> 02:44:09.280]   running across the road is a, you know,
[02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:12.180]   thing at this point in the, you know, tree of life,
[02:44:12.180 --> 02:44:15.020]   then swerve this way, otherwise don't.
[02:44:15.020 --> 02:44:15.860]   Those kinds of things.
[02:44:15.860 --> 02:44:18.100]   - Are there ethical components,
[02:44:18.100 --> 02:44:20.420]   when you start to get to some of the messy human things,
[02:44:20.420 --> 02:44:23.500]   are those encodable into computable knowledge?
[02:44:23.500 --> 02:44:27.300]   - Well, I think that it is a necessary feature
[02:44:27.300 --> 02:44:29.980]   of attempting to automate more in the world
[02:44:29.980 --> 02:44:32.820]   that we encode more and more of ethics
[02:44:32.820 --> 02:44:36.420]   in a way that gets sort of quickly, you know,
[02:44:36.420 --> 02:44:38.260]   is able to be dealt with by computer.
[02:44:38.260 --> 02:44:39.980]   I mean, I've been involved recently,
[02:44:39.980 --> 02:44:42.340]   I sort of got backed into being involved
[02:44:42.340 --> 02:44:45.840]   in the question of automated content selection
[02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:46.680]   on the internet.
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:50.620]   So, you know, the Facebooks, Googles, Twitters, you know,
[02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:53.220]   how do they rank the stuff they feed to us humans?
[02:44:53.220 --> 02:44:54.780]   So to speak.
[02:44:54.780 --> 02:44:56.780]   And the question of what are, you know,
[02:44:56.780 --> 02:44:58.300]   what should never be fed to us?
[02:44:58.300 --> 02:44:59.660]   What should be blocked forever?
[02:44:59.660 --> 02:45:01.860]   What should be upranked, you know?
[02:45:01.860 --> 02:45:04.900]   And what is the, what are the kind of principles behind that?
[02:45:04.900 --> 02:45:07.940]   And what I kind of, well, a bunch of different things
[02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:08.820]   I realized about that.
[02:45:08.820 --> 02:45:13.060]   But one thing that's interesting is being able,
[02:45:13.060 --> 02:45:16.280]   you know, in fact, you're building sort of an AI ethics.
[02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:19.900]   You have to build an AI ethics module in effect to decide,
[02:45:19.900 --> 02:45:21.140]   is this thing so shocking,
[02:45:21.140 --> 02:45:22.780]   I'm never gonna show it to people?
[02:45:22.780 --> 02:45:25.060]   Is this thing so whatever?
[02:45:25.060 --> 02:45:27.380]   And I did realize in thinking about that,
[02:45:27.380 --> 02:45:30.020]   that, you know, there's not gonna be one of these things.
[02:45:30.020 --> 02:45:33.220]   It's not possible to decide, or it might be possible,
[02:45:33.220 --> 02:45:35.460]   but it would be really bad for the future of our species
[02:45:35.460 --> 02:45:39.420]   if we just decided there's this one AI ethics module,
[02:45:39.420 --> 02:45:42.820]   and it's gonna determine the practices
[02:45:42.820 --> 02:45:44.940]   of everything in the world, so to speak.
[02:45:44.940 --> 02:45:46.940]   And I kind of realized one has to sort of break it up.
[02:45:46.940 --> 02:45:49.540]   And that's an interesting societal problem
[02:45:49.540 --> 02:45:50.900]   of how one does that,
[02:45:50.900 --> 02:45:54.940]   and how one sort of has people sort of self-identify for,
[02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:55.900]   you know, I'm buying in,
[02:45:55.900 --> 02:45:57.420]   in the case of just content selection,
[02:45:57.420 --> 02:46:00.980]   it's sort of easier because it's for an individual.
[02:46:00.980 --> 02:46:04.180]   It's not something that kind of cuts across
[02:46:04.180 --> 02:46:07.100]   sort of societal boundaries.
[02:46:07.100 --> 02:46:10.580]   - It's a really interesting notion of,
[02:46:10.580 --> 02:46:13.300]   I heard you describe, I really like it,
[02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:18.300]   sort of maybe in the, sort of have different AI systems
[02:46:18.300 --> 02:46:20.660]   that have a certain kind of brand that they represent,
[02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:23.460]   essentially, but you could have like, I don't know,
[02:46:23.460 --> 02:46:27.620]   whether it's conservative or liberal,
[02:46:27.620 --> 02:46:32.060]   and then libertarian, and there's an Iranian objectivist
[02:46:32.060 --> 02:46:34.780]   AI ethics system, and different ethical,
[02:46:34.780 --> 02:46:38.020]   I mean, it's almost encoding some of the ideologies
[02:46:38.020 --> 02:46:39.300]   which we've been struggling.
[02:46:39.300 --> 02:46:41.020]   I come from the Soviet Union.
[02:46:41.020 --> 02:46:43.660]   That didn't work out so well with the ideologies
[02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:44.500]   that worked out there.
[02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:47.420]   And so you have, but they all,
[02:46:47.420 --> 02:46:50.540]   everybody purchased that particular ethics system.
[02:46:50.540 --> 02:46:51.380]   - Indeed.
[02:46:51.380 --> 02:46:55.380]   - And in the same, I suppose, could be done, encoded,
[02:46:55.380 --> 02:47:00.300]   that system could be encoded into computational knowledge
[02:47:00.300 --> 02:47:03.060]   and allow us to explore in the realm of,
[02:47:03.060 --> 02:47:04.220]   in the digital space.
[02:47:04.220 --> 02:47:06.860]   That's a really exciting possibility.
[02:47:06.860 --> 02:47:10.220]   Are you playing with those ideas in Wolfram Language?
[02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:12.780]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, that's,
[02:47:12.780 --> 02:47:15.740]   Wolfram Language has sort of the best opportunity
[02:47:15.740 --> 02:47:18.500]   to kind of express those essentially computational contracts
[02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:19.540]   about what to do.
[02:47:19.540 --> 02:47:23.060]   Now there's a bunch more work to be done to do it in practice
[02:47:23.060 --> 02:47:26.540]   for deciding the, is this a credible news story?
[02:47:26.540 --> 02:47:27.380]   What does that mean?
[02:47:27.380 --> 02:47:29.460]   Or whatever else you're gonna pick.
[02:47:29.460 --> 02:47:34.460]   I think that that's, you know, that's the question of what,
[02:47:34.460 --> 02:47:39.420]   exactly what we get to do with that is, you know,
[02:47:39.420 --> 02:47:41.100]   for me, it's kind of a complicated thing
[02:47:41.100 --> 02:47:44.180]   because there are these big projects that I think about,
[02:47:44.180 --> 02:47:46.220]   like, you know, find the fundamental theory of physics.
[02:47:46.220 --> 02:47:48.340]   Okay, that's box number one, right?
[02:47:48.340 --> 02:47:51.620]   Box number two, you know, solve the AI ethics problem
[02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:52.700]   in the case of, you know,
[02:47:52.700 --> 02:47:55.580]   figure out how you rank all content, so to speak,
[02:47:55.580 --> 02:47:56.780]   and decide what people see.
[02:47:56.780 --> 02:47:59.540]   That's kind of a box number two, so to speak.
[02:47:59.540 --> 02:48:00.540]   These are big projects.
[02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:01.380]   And I think-
[02:48:01.380 --> 02:48:02.900]   - What do you think is more important?
[02:48:02.900 --> 02:48:06.300]   The fundamental nature of reality or-
[02:48:06.300 --> 02:48:07.260]   - Depends who you ask.
[02:48:07.260 --> 02:48:09.420]   It's one of these things that's exactly like,
[02:48:09.420 --> 02:48:10.740]   you know, what's the ranking, right?
[02:48:10.740 --> 02:48:12.700]   It's the ranking system.
[02:48:12.700 --> 02:48:15.580]   It's like, whose module do you use to rank that?
[02:48:15.580 --> 02:48:18.420]   If you, and I think-
[02:48:18.420 --> 02:48:19.620]   - But having multiple modules
[02:48:19.620 --> 02:48:21.940]   is a really compelling notion to us humans,
[02:48:21.940 --> 02:48:24.060]   that in a world where it's not clear
[02:48:24.060 --> 02:48:26.060]   that there's a right answer,
[02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:31.060]   perhaps you have systems that operate under different,
[02:48:31.060 --> 02:48:35.060]   how would you say it?
[02:48:35.060 --> 02:48:35.940]   I mean-
[02:48:35.940 --> 02:48:37.340]   - It's different value systems, basically.
[02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:38.300]   - Different value systems.
[02:48:38.300 --> 02:48:40.340]   - I mean, I think, you know, in a sense,
[02:48:40.340 --> 02:48:44.460]   I mean, I'm not really a politics-oriented person,
[02:48:44.460 --> 02:48:47.180]   but, you know, in the kind of totalitarianism,
[02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:50.580]   it's kind of like, you're gonna have this system,
[02:48:50.580 --> 02:48:52.100]   and that's the way it is.
[02:48:52.100 --> 02:48:53.780]   I mean, kind of the, you know,
[02:48:53.780 --> 02:48:56.580]   the concept of sort of a market-based system
[02:48:56.580 --> 02:48:58.940]   where you have, okay, I as a human,
[02:48:58.940 --> 02:49:00.540]   I'm gonna pick this system.
[02:49:00.540 --> 02:49:02.900]   I as another human, I'm gonna pick this system.
[02:49:02.900 --> 02:49:04.820]   I mean, that's, in a sense,
[02:49:04.820 --> 02:49:09.820]   this case of automated content selection is a non-trivial,
[02:49:09.820 --> 02:49:13.300]   but it is probably the easiest of the AI ethics situations
[02:49:13.300 --> 02:49:16.020]   because it is each person gets to pick for themselves,
[02:49:16.020 --> 02:49:18.420]   and there's not a huge interplay
[02:49:18.420 --> 02:49:20.240]   between what different people pick.
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:23.640]   By the time you're dealing with other societal things,
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:25.620]   like, you know, what should the policy
[02:49:25.620 --> 02:49:27.460]   of the central bank be or something?
[02:49:27.460 --> 02:49:28.700]   - Or healthcare system or something,
[02:49:28.700 --> 02:49:30.700]   all those kind of centralized kind of things.
[02:49:30.700 --> 02:49:32.340]   - Right, well, I mean, healthcare, again,
[02:49:32.340 --> 02:49:34.660]   has the feature that at some level,
[02:49:34.660 --> 02:49:36.940]   each person can pick for themselves, so to speak.
[02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:38.520]   I mean, whereas there are other things
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:41.520]   where there's a necessary, public health is one example,
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:45.120]   where that's not, where that doesn't get to be, you know,
[02:49:45.120 --> 02:49:48.240]   something which people can, what they pick for themselves,
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:49.780]   they may impose on other people,
[02:49:49.780 --> 02:49:51.800]   and then it becomes a more non-trivial piece
[02:49:51.800 --> 02:49:53.360]   of sort of political philosophy.
[02:49:53.360 --> 02:49:54.840]   - Of course, the central banking systems,
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:49:56.240]   I would argue we would move,
[02:49:56.240 --> 02:49:58.680]   we need to move away into digital currency and so on,
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:01.360]   and Bitcoin and ledgers and so on.
[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:02.920]   So there's a lot of--
[02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:04.240]   - We've been quite involved in that,
[02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:06.560]   and that's where, that's sort of the motivation
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:09.360]   for computational contracts, in part,
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:11.480]   comes out of, you know, this idea,
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:13.000]   oh, we can just have this autonomously
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.340]   executing smart contract.
[02:50:15.340 --> 02:50:18.360]   The idea of a computational contract is just to say,
[02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:22.400]   you know, have something where all of the conditions
[02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:24.900]   of the contract are represented in computational form,
[02:50:24.900 --> 02:50:28.680]   so in principle, it's automatic to execute the contract.
[02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:30.540]   And I think that's, you know,
[02:50:30.540 --> 02:50:33.000]   that will surely be the future of, you know,
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.440]   the idea of legal contracts written in English
[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:38.980]   or legalese or whatever, and where people have to argue
[02:50:38.980 --> 02:50:43.160]   about what goes on is surely not,
[02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:46.560]   you know, we have a much more streamlined process
[02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:48.560]   if everything can be represented computationally
[02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:50.520]   and the computers can kind of decide what to do.
[02:50:50.520 --> 02:50:52.600]   I mean, ironically enough, you know,
[02:50:52.600 --> 02:50:56.440]   old Gottfried Leibniz back in the, you know, 1600s
[02:50:56.440 --> 02:50:58.600]   was saying exactly the same thing,
[02:50:58.600 --> 02:51:02.040]   but he had, you know, his pinnacle of technical achievement
[02:51:02.040 --> 02:51:05.820]   was this brass four-function mechanical calculator thing
[02:51:05.820 --> 02:51:08.440]   that never really worked properly, actually.
[02:51:08.440 --> 02:51:11.340]   And, you know, so he was like 300 years too early
[02:51:11.340 --> 02:51:15.360]   for that idea, but now that idea is pretty realistic,
[02:51:15.360 --> 02:51:18.160]   I think, and, you know, you ask how much more difficult
[02:51:18.160 --> 02:51:20.660]   is it than what we have now in Morphine language
[02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:23.800]   to express, I call it symbolic discourse language,
[02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:26.540]   being able to express sort of everything in the world
[02:51:26.540 --> 02:51:28.940]   in kind of computational symbolic form.
[02:51:28.940 --> 02:51:32.560]   I think it is absolutely within reach.
[02:51:32.560 --> 02:51:34.400]   I mean, I think it's a, you know, I don't know,
[02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:35.800]   maybe I'm just too much of an optimist,
[02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:38.400]   but I think it's a limited number of years
[02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:41.000]   to have a pretty well-built out version of that,
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.160]   that will allow one to encode the kinds of things
[02:51:43.160 --> 02:51:47.440]   that are relevant to typical legal contracts
[02:51:47.440 --> 02:51:48.920]   and these kinds of things.
[02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:52.840]   - The idea of symbolic discourse language,
[02:51:52.840 --> 02:51:57.840]   can you try to define the scope of what it is?
[02:51:57.840 --> 02:52:02.400]   - So we're having a conversation, it's a natural language.
[02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:06.580]   Can we have a representation of the sort of actionable parts
[02:52:06.580 --> 02:52:10.640]   of that conversation in a precise computable form
[02:52:10.640 --> 02:52:12.280]   so that a computer could go do it?
[02:52:12.280 --> 02:52:15.160]   - And not just contracts, but really sort of some
[02:52:15.160 --> 02:52:17.560]   of the things we think of as common sense, essentially,
[02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:21.280]   even just like basic notions of human life.
[02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:23.240]   - Well, I mean, things like, you know,
[02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:27.480]   I'm getting hungry and want to eat something, right?
[02:52:27.480 --> 02:52:29.640]   That's something we don't have a representation,
[02:52:29.640 --> 02:52:31.400]   you know, in Morphine language right now,
[02:52:31.400 --> 02:52:33.600]   if I was like, I'm eating blueberries and raspberries
[02:52:33.600 --> 02:52:35.800]   and things like that, and I'm eating this amount of them,
[02:52:35.800 --> 02:52:38.340]   we know all about those kinds of fruits and plants
[02:52:38.340 --> 02:52:40.500]   and nutrition content and all that kind of thing,
[02:52:40.500 --> 02:52:44.340]   but the I want to eat them part of it is not covered yet.
[02:52:44.340 --> 02:52:47.940]   - And you need to do that in order to have
[02:52:47.940 --> 02:52:50.080]   a complete symbolic discourse language,
[02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:52.640]   to be able to have a natural language conversation.
[02:52:52.640 --> 02:52:55.540]   - Right, right, to be able to express the kinds of things
[02:52:55.540 --> 02:52:58.380]   that say, you know, if it's a legal contract,
[02:52:58.380 --> 02:53:02.020]   it's, you know, the party's desire to have this and that.
[02:53:02.020 --> 02:53:03.980]   And that's, you know, that's a thing like,
[02:53:03.980 --> 02:53:05.740]   I want to eat a raspberry or something,
[02:53:05.740 --> 02:53:07.300]   but that's-- - But isn't that,
[02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:08.820]   isn't this, just to let you,
[02:53:08.820 --> 02:53:12.100]   you said it's centuries old, this dream.
[02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:13.700]   - Yes.
[02:53:13.700 --> 02:53:16.380]   - But it's also the more near term,
[02:53:16.380 --> 02:53:20.340]   the dream of Turing and formulating the Turing test.
[02:53:20.340 --> 02:53:21.180]   - Yes.
[02:53:21.180 --> 02:53:27.360]   - So, do you hope, do you think that's the ultimate test
[02:53:27.360 --> 02:53:32.340]   of creating something special?
[02:53:32.340 --> 02:53:34.340]   'Cause we said-- - I don't know.
[02:53:34.340 --> 02:53:37.220]   I think by special, look, if the test is,
[02:53:37.220 --> 02:53:40.020]   does it walk and talk like a human?
[02:53:40.020 --> 02:53:42.420]   Well, that's just the talking like a human,
[02:53:42.420 --> 02:53:46.340]   but the answer is, it's an okay test.
[02:53:46.340 --> 02:53:49.220]   If you say, is it a test of intelligence?
[02:53:49.220 --> 02:53:52.500]   You know, people have attached the Wolfram Alpha API
[02:53:52.500 --> 02:53:54.860]   to, you know, Turing test bots,
[02:53:54.860 --> 02:53:57.080]   and those bots just lose immediately.
[02:53:57.080 --> 02:53:59.580]   'Cause all you have to do is ask it five questions
[02:53:59.580 --> 02:54:01.900]   that, you know, are about really obscure,
[02:54:01.900 --> 02:54:02.960]   weird pieces of knowledge,
[02:54:02.960 --> 02:54:04.900]   and it's just trot them right out.
[02:54:04.900 --> 02:54:06.900]   And you say, that's not a human, right?
[02:54:06.900 --> 02:54:08.460]   It's a different thing.
[02:54:08.460 --> 02:54:10.260]   It's achieving a different--
[02:54:10.260 --> 02:54:13.300]   - Right now, but it's, I would argue not.
[02:54:13.300 --> 02:54:15.500]   I would argue it's not a different thing.
[02:54:15.500 --> 02:54:20.500]   It's actually legitimately, Wolfram Alpha is legitimately,
[02:54:20.500 --> 02:54:22.540]   or Wolfram Language, I think,
[02:54:22.540 --> 02:54:24.500]   is legitimately trying to solve the Turing,
[02:54:24.500 --> 02:54:26.460]   the intent of the Turing test.
[02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:28.460]   - Perhaps the intent, yeah, perhaps the intent.
[02:54:28.460 --> 02:54:30.140]   I mean, it's actually kind of fun, you know,
[02:54:30.140 --> 02:54:32.260]   Alan Turing had tried to work out,
[02:54:32.260 --> 02:54:35.180]   he thought about taking Encyclopedia Britannica,
[02:54:35.180 --> 02:54:37.780]   and, you know, making it computational in some way,
[02:54:37.780 --> 02:54:40.220]   and he estimated how much work it would be.
[02:54:40.220 --> 02:54:41.580]   And actually, I have to say,
[02:54:41.580 --> 02:54:43.860]   he was a bit more pessimistic than the reality.
[02:54:43.860 --> 02:54:45.420]   We did it more efficiently than that.
[02:54:45.420 --> 02:54:47.060]   - But to him, that represented--
[02:54:47.060 --> 02:54:48.940]   - So, I mean, he was on the same--
[02:54:48.940 --> 02:54:50.260]   - It's a mighty mental task.
[02:54:50.260 --> 02:54:52.300]   - Yeah, right, he had the same idea.
[02:54:52.300 --> 02:54:53.660]   I mean, it was, you know,
[02:54:53.660 --> 02:54:55.180]   we were able to do it more efficiently,
[02:54:55.180 --> 02:54:58.060]   'cause we had a lot, we had layers of automation
[02:54:58.060 --> 02:55:00.660]   that he, I think, hadn't, you know,
[02:55:00.660 --> 02:55:03.780]   it's hard to imagine those layers of abstraction
[02:55:03.780 --> 02:55:05.540]   that end up being built up.
[02:55:05.540 --> 02:55:07.180]   - But to him, it represented, like,
[02:55:07.180 --> 02:55:08.940]   an impossible task, essentially.
[02:55:08.940 --> 02:55:10.260]   - Well, he thought it was difficult.
[02:55:10.260 --> 02:55:11.340]   He thought it was, you know,
[02:55:11.340 --> 02:55:12.700]   maybe if he'd lived another 50 years,
[02:55:12.700 --> 02:55:14.740]   he would've been able to do it, I don't know.
[02:55:14.740 --> 02:55:17.860]   - In the interest of time, easy questions.
[02:55:17.860 --> 02:55:18.900]   - Go for it.
[02:55:18.900 --> 02:55:20.660]   - What is intelligence?
[02:55:20.660 --> 02:55:21.500]   (laughing)
[02:55:21.500 --> 02:55:22.340]   You talk about--
[02:55:22.340 --> 02:55:24.300]   - I love the way you say easy questions, man.
[02:55:24.300 --> 02:55:28.180]   - You talked about, sort of,
[02:55:28.180 --> 02:55:32.460]   rule 30 and cellular automata humbling your sense of
[02:55:32.460 --> 02:55:37.380]   human beings having a monopoly on intelligence.
[02:55:37.380 --> 02:55:41.560]   But in retrospect, just looking broadly now,
[02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:43.660]   with all the things you learn from computation,
[02:55:43.660 --> 02:55:45.900]   what is intelligence?
[02:55:45.900 --> 02:55:47.460]   How does intelligence arise?
[02:55:47.460 --> 02:55:48.940]   - Yeah, I don't think there's a bright line
[02:55:48.940 --> 02:55:50.220]   of what intelligence is.
[02:55:50.220 --> 02:55:54.260]   I think intelligence is, at some level, just computation,
[02:55:54.260 --> 02:55:57.220]   but for us, intelligence is defined
[02:55:57.220 --> 02:56:00.340]   to be computation that is doing things we care about.
[02:56:00.340 --> 02:56:04.780]   And, you know, that's a very special definition.
[02:56:04.780 --> 02:56:07.740]   It's a very, you know, when you try and make it,
[02:56:07.740 --> 02:56:08.580]   you know, you try and say,
[02:56:08.580 --> 02:56:10.460]   "Well, intelligence is this, it's problem solving,
[02:56:10.460 --> 02:56:12.800]   "it's doing general this, it's doing that,
[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:13.720]   "this, that, and the other thing.
[02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:17.380]   "It's operating within a human environment type thing."
[02:56:17.380 --> 02:56:19.140]   Okay, you know, that's fine.
[02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:22.180]   If you say, "Well, what's intelligence in general?"
[02:56:22.180 --> 02:56:24.760]   You know, that's, I think,
[02:56:24.760 --> 02:56:27.060]   that question is totally slippery,
[02:56:27.060 --> 02:56:28.540]   and doesn't really have an answer.
[02:56:28.540 --> 02:56:30.640]   As soon as you say, "What is it in general?"
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:33.500]   It quickly segues into,
[02:56:33.500 --> 02:56:36.540]   "This is just computation," so to speak.
[02:56:36.540 --> 02:56:38.340]   - But in the sea of computation,
[02:56:38.340 --> 02:56:42.500]   how many things, if we were to pick randomly,
[02:56:42.500 --> 02:56:46.300]   is your sense, would have the kind of impressive,
[02:56:46.300 --> 02:56:48.980]   to us humans, levels of intelligence?
[02:56:48.980 --> 02:56:52.900]   Meaning, it could do a lot of general things
[02:56:52.900 --> 02:56:54.460]   that are useful to us humans.
[02:56:54.460 --> 02:56:56.580]   - Right, well, according to the principle
[02:56:56.580 --> 02:56:58.820]   of computational equivalence, lots of them.
[02:56:58.820 --> 02:57:01.540]   I mean, if you ask me,
[02:57:01.540 --> 02:57:03.400]   just in cellular automata or something,
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:06.260]   I don't know, it's maybe 1%, a few percent,
[02:57:06.260 --> 02:57:08.540]   achieve, it varies, actually.
[02:57:08.540 --> 02:57:11.100]   It's a little bit, as you get to slightly
[02:57:11.100 --> 02:57:13.220]   more complicated rules, the chance that
[02:57:13.220 --> 02:57:14.980]   there'll be enough stuff there
[02:57:14.980 --> 02:57:19.580]   to sort of reach this kind of equivalence point,
[02:57:19.580 --> 02:57:21.820]   it makes it maybe 10, 20% of all of them.
[02:57:21.820 --> 02:57:24.260]   So it's very disappointing, really.
[02:57:24.260 --> 02:57:26.860]   I mean, it's kind of like, we think
[02:57:26.860 --> 02:57:31.100]   there's this whole long sort of biological evolution,
[02:57:31.100 --> 02:57:33.180]   kind of intellectual evolution,
[02:57:33.180 --> 02:57:35.660]   cultural evolution that our species has gone through.
[02:57:35.660 --> 02:57:37.460]   It's kind of disappointing to think
[02:57:37.460 --> 02:57:39.940]   that that hasn't achieved more.
[02:57:39.940 --> 02:57:42.500]   But it has achieved something very special to us.
[02:57:42.500 --> 02:57:44.060]   It just hasn't achieved something
[02:57:44.060 --> 02:57:46.500]   generally more, so to speak.
[02:57:46.500 --> 02:57:49.340]   - But what do you think about this extra,
[02:57:49.340 --> 02:57:52.100]   feels like human thing, of subjective experience
[02:57:52.100 --> 02:57:53.380]   of consciousness?
[02:57:53.380 --> 02:57:54.780]   What is consciousness?
[02:57:54.780 --> 02:57:57.100]   - Well, I think it's a deeply slippery thing,
[02:57:57.100 --> 02:58:00.500]   and I'm always wondering what my cellular automata feel.
[02:58:00.500 --> 02:58:03.300]   I mean, I think-- - What do they feel?
[02:58:03.300 --> 02:58:05.180]   Now, you're wondering as an observer.
[02:58:05.180 --> 02:58:06.620]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, who's to know?
[02:58:06.620 --> 02:58:08.100]   I mean, I think that the--
[02:58:08.100 --> 02:58:09.500]   - Do you think, sorry to interrupt,
[02:58:09.500 --> 02:58:12.940]   do you think consciousness can emerge from computation?
[02:58:12.940 --> 02:58:16.460]   - Yeah, I mean, everything, whatever you mean by it,
[02:58:16.460 --> 02:58:19.180]   it's going to be, I mean, look,
[02:58:19.180 --> 02:58:20.340]   I have to tell a little story.
[02:58:20.340 --> 02:58:23.500]   I was at an AI ethics conference fairly recently,
[02:58:23.500 --> 02:58:26.340]   and people were, I think maybe I brought it up,
[02:58:26.340 --> 02:58:29.100]   but I was talking about rights of AIs.
[02:58:29.100 --> 02:58:32.180]   When will AIs have, when should we think of AIs
[02:58:32.180 --> 02:58:33.660]   as having rights?
[02:58:33.660 --> 02:58:36.780]   When should we think that it's immoral
[02:58:36.780 --> 02:58:39.700]   to destroy the memories of AIs, for example?
[02:58:39.700 --> 02:58:41.980]   Those kinds of things.
[02:58:41.980 --> 02:58:44.140]   And some, actually a philosopher in this case,
[02:58:44.140 --> 02:58:46.060]   it's usually the techies who are the most naive,
[02:58:46.060 --> 02:58:50.100]   but in this case, it was a philosopher
[02:58:50.100 --> 02:58:53.620]   who sort of piped up and said,
[02:58:53.620 --> 02:58:56.380]   well, you know,
[02:58:56.380 --> 02:59:00.380]   the AIs will have rights
[02:59:00.380 --> 02:59:03.220]   when we know that they have consciousness.
[02:59:03.220 --> 02:59:05.780]   And I'm like, good luck with that.
[02:59:05.780 --> 02:59:09.380]   I mean, it's a, I mean, this is a, you know,
[02:59:09.380 --> 02:59:10.860]   it's a very circular thing.
[02:59:10.860 --> 02:59:14.660]   You'll end up saying this thing that has sort of,
[02:59:14.660 --> 02:59:15.540]   you know, when you talk about it
[02:59:15.540 --> 02:59:17.260]   having subjective experience,
[02:59:17.260 --> 02:59:20.100]   I think that's just another one of these words
[02:59:20.100 --> 02:59:22.700]   that doesn't really have a, you know,
[02:59:22.700 --> 02:59:26.820]   there's no ground truth definition of what that means.
[02:59:26.820 --> 02:59:29.060]   - By the way, I would say,
[02:59:29.060 --> 02:59:31.580]   I do personally think that it'll be a time
[02:59:31.580 --> 02:59:33.500]   when AI will demand rights.
[02:59:33.500 --> 02:59:37.300]   And I think they'll demand rights
[02:59:37.300 --> 02:59:39.900]   when they say they have consciousness,
[02:59:39.900 --> 02:59:42.340]   which is not a circular definition.
[02:59:42.340 --> 02:59:43.420]   - Well, fair enough.
[02:59:43.420 --> 02:59:44.260]   - So-
[02:59:44.260 --> 02:59:47.020]   - But it may have been actually a human thing
[02:59:47.020 --> 02:59:50.500]   where the humans encouraged it and said, basically,
[02:59:50.500 --> 02:59:52.620]   you know, we want you to be more like us
[02:59:52.620 --> 02:59:55.020]   'cause we're gonna be, you know, interacting with you.
[02:59:55.020 --> 02:59:59.380]   And so we want you to be sort of very Turing test like,
[02:59:59.380 --> 03:00:01.380]   you know, just like us.
[03:00:01.380 --> 03:00:04.140]   And it's like, yeah, we're just like you.
[03:00:04.140 --> 03:00:06.780]   We want to vote too, whatever.
[03:00:06.780 --> 03:00:10.740]   Which is, I mean, it's an interesting thing
[03:00:10.740 --> 03:00:12.060]   to think through in a world
[03:00:12.060 --> 03:00:16.300]   where consciousnesses are not counted like humans are.
[03:00:16.300 --> 03:00:18.660]   That's a complicated business.
[03:00:18.660 --> 03:00:23.660]   - So in many ways, you've launched quite a few ideas,
[03:00:23.660 --> 03:00:28.980]   revolutions that could, in some number of years,
[03:00:28.980 --> 03:00:31.620]   have huge amount of impact,
[03:00:31.620 --> 03:00:34.560]   sort of more than they had or even had already.
[03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:37.460]   That might be, I mean, to me,
[03:00:37.460 --> 03:00:39.900]   cellular automata is a fascinating world
[03:00:39.900 --> 03:00:42.420]   that I think could potentially,
[03:00:42.420 --> 03:00:47.420]   even beside the discussion of fundamental laws of physics,
[03:00:47.420 --> 03:00:51.340]   just might be, the idea of computation
[03:00:51.340 --> 03:00:54.060]   might be transformational to society
[03:00:54.060 --> 03:00:56.080]   in a way we can't even predict yet.
[03:00:56.080 --> 03:00:58.300]   But it might be years away.
[03:00:58.300 --> 03:00:59.580]   - That's true.
[03:00:59.580 --> 03:01:01.500]   I mean, I think you can kind of see the map, actually.
[03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:03.460]   It's not mysterious.
[03:01:03.460 --> 03:01:05.780]   I mean, the fact is that, you know,
[03:01:05.780 --> 03:01:09.260]   this idea of computation is sort of a, you know,
[03:01:09.260 --> 03:01:12.900]   it's a big paradigm that lots and lots of things
[03:01:12.900 --> 03:01:13.780]   are fitting into.
[03:01:13.780 --> 03:01:16.300]   And it's kind of like, you know, we talk about,
[03:01:16.300 --> 03:01:20.040]   you talk about, I don't know, this company,
[03:01:20.040 --> 03:01:22.140]   this organization has momentum in what it's doing.
[03:01:22.140 --> 03:01:23.940]   We talk about these things that, you know,
[03:01:23.940 --> 03:01:25.980]   we've internalized these concepts
[03:01:25.980 --> 03:01:28.080]   from Newtonian physics and so on.
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:30.980]   In time, things like computational irreducibility
[03:01:30.980 --> 03:01:34.540]   will become as, you know, as,
[03:01:34.540 --> 03:01:36.100]   actually, I was amused recently.
[03:01:36.100 --> 03:01:38.020]   I happened to be testifying at the US Senate.
[03:01:38.020 --> 03:01:40.060]   And so I was amused that the term
[03:01:40.060 --> 03:01:43.800]   computational irreducibility is now, can be, you know,
[03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:45.220]   it's on the congressional record
[03:01:45.220 --> 03:01:48.260]   and being repeated by people in those kinds of settings.
[03:01:48.260 --> 03:01:50.740]   And that's only the beginning because, you know,
[03:01:50.740 --> 03:01:53.060]   computational irreducibility, for example,
[03:01:53.060 --> 03:01:56.460]   will end up being something really important for,
[03:01:56.460 --> 03:02:00.560]   I mean, it's kind of a funny thing that, you know,
[03:02:00.560 --> 03:02:03.360]   one can kind of see this inexorable phenomenon.
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:05.900]   I mean, it's, you know, as more and more stuff
[03:02:05.900 --> 03:02:08.940]   becomes automated and computational and so on,
[03:02:08.940 --> 03:02:12.580]   so these core ideas about how computation work
[03:02:12.580 --> 03:02:15.220]   necessarily become more and more significant.
[03:02:15.220 --> 03:02:18.620]   And I think one of the things for people like me
[03:02:18.620 --> 03:02:20.580]   who like kind of trying to figure out
[03:02:20.580 --> 03:02:22.600]   sort of big stories and so on,
[03:02:22.600 --> 03:02:26.460]   it's one of the bad features is
[03:02:26.460 --> 03:02:28.640]   it takes unbelievably long time
[03:02:28.640 --> 03:02:30.500]   for things to happen on a human time scale.
[03:02:30.500 --> 03:02:33.680]   I mean, the time scale of history,
[03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:35.180]   it all looks instantaneous.
[03:02:35.180 --> 03:02:36.020]   - It's a blink of an eye.
[03:02:36.020 --> 03:02:38.740]   But let me ask the human question.
[03:02:38.740 --> 03:02:41.380]   Do you ponder mortality, your own mortality?
[03:02:41.380 --> 03:02:42.340]   - Of course I do.
[03:02:42.340 --> 03:02:45.420]   Yeah, every sense, I've been interested in that for,
[03:02:45.420 --> 03:02:47.260]   you know, it's a, you know,
[03:02:47.260 --> 03:02:49.620]   the big discontinuity of human history will come
[03:02:49.620 --> 03:02:53.860]   when one achieves effective human immortality.
[03:02:53.860 --> 03:02:55.980]   And that's gonna be the biggest discontinuity
[03:02:55.980 --> 03:02:56.860]   in human history.
[03:02:56.860 --> 03:02:59.860]   - If you could be immortal, would you choose to be?
[03:02:59.860 --> 03:03:01.340]   - Oh yeah, I'm having fun.
[03:03:01.340 --> 03:03:02.900]   (laughs)
[03:03:03.380 --> 03:03:06.740]   - Do you think it's possible that mortality
[03:03:06.740 --> 03:03:09.580]   is the thing that gives everything meaning
[03:03:09.580 --> 03:03:11.260]   and makes it fun?
[03:03:11.260 --> 03:03:13.920]   - Yeah, that's a complicated issue, right?
[03:03:13.920 --> 03:03:18.420]   I mean, the way that human motivation will evolve
[03:03:18.420 --> 03:03:21.740]   when there is effective human immortality is unclear.
[03:03:21.740 --> 03:03:24.900]   I mean, if you look at sort of, you know,
[03:03:24.900 --> 03:03:27.380]   you look at the human condition as it now exists
[03:03:27.380 --> 03:03:29.860]   and you like change that, you know,
[03:03:29.860 --> 03:03:32.220]   you change that knob, so to speak,
[03:03:32.220 --> 03:03:33.820]   it doesn't really work.
[03:03:33.820 --> 03:03:37.440]   You know, the human condition as it now exists has,
[03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:41.180]   you know, mortality is kind of something
[03:03:41.180 --> 03:03:43.520]   that is deeply factored into the human condition
[03:03:43.520 --> 03:03:44.980]   as it now exists.
[03:03:44.980 --> 03:03:46.420]   And I think that that's, I mean,
[03:03:46.420 --> 03:03:50.740]   that is indeed an interesting question is, you know,
[03:03:50.740 --> 03:03:54.180]   from a purely selfish, I'm having fun point of view,
[03:03:54.180 --> 03:03:57.660]   so to speak, it's easy to say,
[03:03:57.660 --> 03:03:59.100]   hey, I could keep doing this forever.
[03:03:59.500 --> 03:04:02.300]   There's an infinite collection of things
[03:04:02.300 --> 03:04:03.460]   I'd like to figure out.
[03:04:03.460 --> 03:04:06.700]   But I think the, you know,
[03:04:06.700 --> 03:04:08.740]   what the future of history looks like
[03:04:08.740 --> 03:04:14.800]   in a time of human immortality is an interesting one.
[03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:17.660]   I mean, my own view of this,
[03:04:17.660 --> 03:04:19.700]   I was very, I was kind of unhappy about that
[03:04:19.700 --> 03:04:22.340]   'cause I was kind of, you know, it's like, okay,
[03:04:22.340 --> 03:04:26.060]   forget sort of biological form, you know,
[03:04:26.060 --> 03:04:28.300]   everything becomes digital, everybody is,
[03:04:28.300 --> 03:04:30.580]   you know, it's the giant, you know,
[03:04:30.580 --> 03:04:33.860]   the cloud of a trillion souls type thing.
[03:04:33.860 --> 03:04:37.060]   And then, you know, and then that seems boring
[03:04:37.060 --> 03:04:38.420]   'cause it's like play video games
[03:04:38.420 --> 03:04:41.020]   for the rest of eternity type thing.
[03:04:41.020 --> 03:04:43.700]   But what I think I, I mean, my,
[03:04:43.700 --> 03:04:49.860]   I got less depressed about that idea
[03:04:49.860 --> 03:04:52.160]   on realizing that if you look at human history
[03:04:52.160 --> 03:04:54.240]   and you say, what was the important thing,
[03:04:54.240 --> 03:04:56.300]   the thing people said was, you know,
[03:04:56.300 --> 03:04:59.300]   this is the big story at any given time in history,
[03:04:59.300 --> 03:05:00.920]   it's changed a bunch.
[03:05:00.920 --> 03:05:03.140]   And, you know, whether it's, you know,
[03:05:03.140 --> 03:05:05.020]   why am I doing what I'm doing?
[03:05:05.020 --> 03:05:07.060]   Well, there's a whole chain of discussion about,
[03:05:07.060 --> 03:05:10.140]   well, I'm doing this because of this, because of that.
[03:05:10.140 --> 03:05:13.420]   And a lot of those becauses would have made no sense
[03:05:13.420 --> 03:05:14.520]   a thousand years ago.
[03:05:14.520 --> 03:05:16.540]   Absolutely no sense.
[03:05:16.540 --> 03:05:19.740]   - Even the, so the interpretation of the human condition,
[03:05:19.740 --> 03:05:23.000]   even the meaning of life changes over time.
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:24.540]   - Well, I mean, why do people do things?
[03:05:24.540 --> 03:05:28.420]   You know, it's, if you say whatever,
[03:05:28.420 --> 03:05:32.380]   I mean, the number of people in, I don't know, doing,
[03:05:32.380 --> 03:05:33.700]   you know, a number of people at MIT
[03:05:33.700 --> 03:05:34.900]   who say they're doing what they're doing
[03:05:34.900 --> 03:05:37.880]   for the greater glory of God is probably not that large.
[03:05:37.880 --> 03:05:40.040]   Whereas if you go back 500 years,
[03:05:40.040 --> 03:05:41.540]   you'd find a lot of people
[03:05:41.540 --> 03:05:43.400]   who are doing kind of creative things,
[03:05:43.400 --> 03:05:44.740]   that's what they would say.
[03:05:44.740 --> 03:05:46.580]   And--
[03:05:46.580 --> 03:05:48.980]   - So today, because you've been thinking
[03:05:48.980 --> 03:05:52.180]   about computation so much and been humbled by it,
[03:05:52.180 --> 03:05:54.500]   what do you think is the meaning of life?
[03:05:54.500 --> 03:05:58.620]   - (laughs) Well, it's, you know, that's a thing where,
[03:05:58.620 --> 03:06:01.740]   I don't know what meaning, I mean, you know,
[03:06:01.740 --> 03:06:03.840]   my attitude is,
[03:06:03.840 --> 03:06:09.580]   I, you know, I do things which I find fulfilling to do.
[03:06:09.580 --> 03:06:13.580]   I'm not sure that I can necessarily justify, you know,
[03:06:13.580 --> 03:06:14.900]   each and everything that I do
[03:06:14.900 --> 03:06:16.980]   on the basis of some broader context.
[03:06:16.980 --> 03:06:19.040]   I mean, I think that for me,
[03:06:19.040 --> 03:06:21.540]   it so happens that the things I find fulfilling to do,
[03:06:21.540 --> 03:06:24.380]   some of them are quite big, some of them are much smaller.
[03:06:24.860 --> 03:06:28.360]   You know, I, they're things that I've not found interesting
[03:06:28.360 --> 03:06:30.300]   earlier in my life and I now found interesting.
[03:06:30.300 --> 03:06:33.740]   Like I got interested in like education
[03:06:33.740 --> 03:06:35.180]   and teaching people things and so on,
[03:06:35.180 --> 03:06:38.740]   which I didn't find that interesting when I was younger.
[03:06:38.740 --> 03:06:43.220]   And, you know, can I justify that in some big global sense?
[03:06:43.220 --> 03:06:46.460]   I don't think, I mean, I can describe
[03:06:46.460 --> 03:06:48.380]   why I think it might be important in the world,
[03:06:48.380 --> 03:06:51.660]   but I think my local reason for doing it
[03:06:51.660 --> 03:06:53.620]   is that I find it personally fulfilling,
[03:06:53.620 --> 03:06:57.080]   which I can't, you know, explain on a sort of,
[03:06:57.080 --> 03:06:59.660]   I mean, it's just like this discussion
[03:06:59.660 --> 03:07:01.340]   of things like AI ethics, you know,
[03:07:01.340 --> 03:07:04.000]   is there a ground truth to the ethics
[03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:05.340]   that we should be having?
[03:07:05.340 --> 03:07:07.580]   I don't think I can find a ground truth to my life
[03:07:07.580 --> 03:07:09.860]   any more than I can suggest a ground truth
[03:07:09.860 --> 03:07:14.020]   for kind of the ethics for the whole of civilization.
[03:07:14.020 --> 03:07:16.620]   I think that's a, you know, my,
[03:07:16.620 --> 03:07:20.420]   you know, it would be, it would be a,
[03:07:21.300 --> 03:07:24.540]   yeah, it's sort of a, I think I'm,
[03:07:24.540 --> 03:07:27.620]   you know, at different times in my life,
[03:07:27.620 --> 03:07:31.540]   I've had different kind of goal structures and so on.
[03:07:31.540 --> 03:07:34.060]   - From your perspective, you're local,
[03:07:34.060 --> 03:07:36.460]   you're just a cell in the cellular automata,
[03:07:36.460 --> 03:07:40.220]   but in some sense, I find it funny from my observation
[03:07:40.220 --> 03:07:44.820]   is I kind of, you know, it seems that the universe
[03:07:44.820 --> 03:07:47.980]   is using you to understand itself in some sense.
[03:07:47.980 --> 03:07:49.540]   You're not aware of it.
[03:07:49.540 --> 03:07:51.500]   - Yeah, well, right, well, if it turns out
[03:07:51.500 --> 03:07:53.780]   that we reduce sort of all of the universe
[03:07:53.780 --> 03:07:57.900]   to some simple rule, everything is connected, so to speak.
[03:07:57.900 --> 03:08:02.700]   And so it is inexorable in that case that, you know,
[03:08:02.700 --> 03:08:06.860]   if I'm involved in finding how that rule works,
[03:08:06.860 --> 03:08:10.660]   then, you know, then that's a,
[03:08:10.660 --> 03:08:13.580]   it's inexorable that the universe set it up that way.
[03:08:13.580 --> 03:08:15.300]   But I think, you know, one of the things I find
[03:08:15.300 --> 03:08:18.860]   a little bit, you know, this goal of finding
[03:08:18.860 --> 03:08:21.420]   fundamental theory of physics, for example,
[03:08:21.420 --> 03:08:25.740]   if indeed we end up as the sort of virtualized consciousness,
[03:08:25.740 --> 03:08:28.700]   the disappointing feature is people will probably care less
[03:08:28.700 --> 03:08:30.540]   about the fundamental theory of physics
[03:08:30.540 --> 03:08:31.900]   in that setting than they would now,
[03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:34.420]   because gosh, it's like, you know,
[03:08:34.420 --> 03:08:38.700]   what the machine code is down below underneath this thing
[03:08:38.700 --> 03:08:42.420]   is much less important if you're virtualized, so to speak.
[03:08:42.420 --> 03:08:46.840]   And I think the, although I think my own personal,
[03:08:47.860 --> 03:08:51.100]   you talk about ego, I find it just amusing that,
[03:08:51.100 --> 03:08:54.940]   you know, kind of, you know, if you're imagining
[03:08:54.940 --> 03:08:56.340]   that sort of virtualized consciousness,
[03:08:56.340 --> 03:08:58.260]   like what does the virtualized consciousness do
[03:08:58.260 --> 03:08:59.760]   for the rest of eternity?
[03:08:59.760 --> 03:09:02.940]   Well, you can explore, you know, the video game
[03:09:02.940 --> 03:09:05.860]   that represents the universe as the universe is,
[03:09:05.860 --> 03:09:09.220]   or you can go off, you can go off that reservation
[03:09:09.220 --> 03:09:11.600]   and go and start exploring the computational universe
[03:09:11.600 --> 03:09:13.420]   of all possible universes.
[03:09:13.420 --> 03:09:16.900]   And so in some vision of the future of history,
[03:09:16.900 --> 03:09:19.580]   it's like the disembodied consciousnesses
[03:09:19.580 --> 03:09:23.940]   are all sort of pursuing things like my new kind of science
[03:09:23.940 --> 03:09:25.780]   sort of for the rest of eternity, so to speak,
[03:09:25.780 --> 03:09:29.900]   and that ends up being the kind of the thing
[03:09:29.900 --> 03:09:32.980]   that represents the, you know,
[03:09:32.980 --> 03:09:35.700]   the future of kind of the human condition.
[03:09:35.700 --> 03:09:38.340]   - I don't think there's a better way to end it.
[03:09:38.340 --> 03:09:39.460]   Stephen, thank you so much.
[03:09:39.460 --> 03:09:41.100]   It's a huge honor talking today.

[03:09:42.180 --> 03:09:43.300]   - This was great.
[03:09:43.300 --> 03:09:44.300]   You did very well.

[03:10:12.940 --> 03:10:15.100]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[03:10:15.100 --> 03:10:16.820]   from Stephen Wolfram.
[03:10:16.820 --> 03:10:19.660]   It is perhaps a little humbling to discover
[03:10:19.660 --> 03:10:22.580]   that we as humans are in effect computationally
[03:10:22.580 --> 03:10:24.500]   no more capable than the cellular automata
[03:10:24.500 --> 03:10:26.340]   with very simple rules,
[03:10:26.340 --> 03:10:28.740]   but the principle of computational equivalence
[03:10:28.740 --> 03:10:31.340]   also implies that the same is ultimately true
[03:10:31.340 --> 03:10:32.940]   of our whole universe.
[03:10:32.940 --> 03:10:35.700]   So while science has often made it seem
[03:10:35.700 --> 03:10:38.660]   that we as humans are somehow insignificant
[03:10:38.660 --> 03:10:40.220]   compared to the universe,
[03:10:40.220 --> 03:10:43.060]   the principle of computational equivalence now shows
[03:10:43.060 --> 03:10:46.460]   that in a certain sense, we're at the same level.
[03:10:46.460 --> 03:10:49.900]   For the principle implies that what goes on inside us
[03:10:49.900 --> 03:10:52.540]   can ultimately achieve just the same level
[03:10:52.540 --> 03:10:56.220]   of computational sophistication as our whole universe.
[03:10:56.220 --> 03:10:59.500]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
