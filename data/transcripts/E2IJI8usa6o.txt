[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   was this guy Elwell who founded Federal Telegraph.
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.840]   They then hired some fairly bright people
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.360]   like Lee DeForest.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.120]   They then did things like provided jobs
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.960]   for people like the young Fred Turman,
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.520]   whose father was a Stanford scientist.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.840]   Now, he really plays an outsized role
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.640]   in setting up the Stanford Industrial Park,
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.480]   attracting Fairchild Semiconductor.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.680]   Fairchild Semiconductor attracts these people
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.560]   and then repels them
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.880]   because you have this brilliant guy Shockley, right?
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.280]   He's both brilliant and sort of personally abhorrent
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.880]   who manages to attract brilliant people
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.800]   and then repel all of them.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.600]   And so they all end up dispersing themselves
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.440]   into different companies
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.680]   and they create this incredibly creative ecosystem
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.440]   that is the heart of Silicon Valley.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.080]   I think the thing that many of us worry about
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.400]   in terms of Silicon Valley more recently
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.720]   is it feels much more like it's a one industry town,
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.560]   which is dangerous.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.120]   And it feels more like it's a bunch of industrial behemoths
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.000]   rather than a bunch of smart and scrappy startups.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.240]   And that's a recipe that feels much more like Detroit
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.240]   in the 1950s than it does like Silicon Valley in the 1960s.
