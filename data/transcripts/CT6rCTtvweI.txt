[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.960]   A long time reader of Desiring God content
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.120]   and a podcast listener who lives in Africa
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.960]   writes in with an honest question.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.080]   Pastor John, I am a married man with four children
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.200]   and recently I met another woman.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.840]   I love her and have told my wife about her.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.160]   What I would like to know from you
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.560]   is whether or not it is wrong
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.080]   to have two wives as a Christian.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.560]   And before you answer this question, Pastor John,
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.000]   of course, we should keep in mind
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.280]   that a number of African countries
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.560]   do allow polygamous civil marriage,
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.360]   as of course is true in the Middle East
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.920]   and in certain countries,
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.820]   as was true in the Old Testament and the Bible.
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.840]   And so, and even closer to home,
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.920]   in the state of Utah, polygamy is technically illegal
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.700]   but not enforced as I understand it.
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.960]   More broadly, this was interesting to me,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.480]   a Gallup survey has been tracking opinions
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.600]   on key moral issues in America since the early 2000s.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.440]   And in 2001, they said 7% of Americans
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.360]   said polygamy was morally acceptable.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.480]   And today that number is 16%
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.880]   say that polygamy is morally acceptable.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.360]   Popular American TV shows are spotlighting polygamy
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.840]   and perhaps pushing this acceptance of the practice
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.880]   in America and of course, the SCOTUS decision
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.820]   opens the door for all types of so-called marriages now,
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.360]   as we talked about yesterday.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.700]   So what are we to make a polygamy
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.420]   from a Christian perspective?
[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.040]   Let's cut to the chase.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.800]   I don't believe that the will of God today
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.080]   as revealed in the New Testament
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.120]   and rightly read the Old Testament
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.640]   is to give permission or promotion to polygamy.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.360]   So that's the statement.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.800]   Here are my six biblical reasons.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.400]   Number one, in the beginning,
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.360]   God created man, male and female
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.400]   with the purpose that they would marry
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.360]   and the two would become one flesh.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.840]   So the Lord made woman from the side of man
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.760]   and then it says in Genesis 2, 23,
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.200]   "This at last," Adam is responding,
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.880]   "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.920]   She should be called woman
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.760]   because she was taken out of man."
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.760]   And then this absolutely key verse
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.920]   that Jesus and Paul quote,
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.880]   "Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.160]   and hold fast to his wife
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.920]   and they shall become one flesh."
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.680]   That verse, 2, 24 of Genesis is cited by Jesus and Paul
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.840]   as decisive in the meaning of marriage today.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   And the meaning focuses especially on this leaving parents
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.280]   and cleaving to one wife and becoming one flesh with her.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.720]   That one flesh reality
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.600]   is profoundly compromised by polygamy.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.400]   Number two, when Jesus dealt with divorce
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.520]   and showed how the Pharisees were getting divorces
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.920]   when they shouldn't,
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.640]   even though it was permitted in the Old Testament,
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.280]   he showed us in his response,
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.280]   a way to understand why polygamy was also permitted
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.480]   and yet is now forbidden.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.320]   Here's what he said,
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.400]   "Have you not read that he who created them
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.920]   from the beginning made them male and female and said,
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.600]   'Therefore, a man shall leave his mother and father
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.080]   and cleave to his wife
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.800]   and the two shall be one flesh.'
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.880]   What therefore God has joined together,
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.440]   let no man separate.'
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.520]   And they said, 'Why then did Moses command one
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.920]   to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?'
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.840]   And we could imagine them also saying,
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.320]   'Well, why then did he permit polygamy?'
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.560]   If that were the issue.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.720]   Jesus said to them, 'Because of your hardness of heart,
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.000]   Moses allows you to divorce your wives.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.360]   But from the beginning, it was not so.'"
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.160]   So the reason Jesus did not any longer permit
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.880]   what had been permitted is because he chalked it up
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.180]   in the Old Testament to tolerance of the expressions
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.120]   of the hardness of the heart,
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.560]   and he's raising the standard.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.920]   The reason Jesus didn't address polygamy
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.800]   the same way he addressed divorce was that in his day,
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.200]   the Jewish culture had basically already given it up.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.600]   It just wasn't an issue.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.360]   People weren't coming to him with multiple wives
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.560]   and saying, 'Is this okay?'
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.240]   That would have been nice for us today
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.680]   or for certain cultures if he had, but he didn't.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.720]   So the point there was there is a way to understand
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.640]   the tolerance of an act in the Old Testament,
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.320]   which now is forbidden.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.640]   Number three, you can see already in Genesis 4
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.960]   that polygamy was indeed owing to the growing
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.800]   of the hardness of the heart
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.880]   after the fall of Adam and Eve.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.000]   I think that's exactly what Moses wants us to see
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.680]   in the way he describes Lamech, the seventh from Adam,
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.040]   the seventh generation from Adam.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.040]   So here's what it says in Genesis 4, 19.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.520]   Lamech took two wives, first time it's ever happened.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.800]   Lamech took two wives.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.160]   Lamech said to his wives, 'Ada and Zillah, hear my voice,
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.600]   you wives of Lamech.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.720]   Listen to what I say.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.960]   I have killed a man for wounding me,
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.680]   a young man for striking me.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.080]   If Cain's revenge is sevenfold, then Lamech's is 77-fold.'
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.560]   I mean, you can't imagine a more high-handed,
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.920]   ugly, mean-spirited, in-your-face,
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.680]   against God statement than that.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.160]   And it comes right after saying,
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.280]   he took two wives, unlike the others.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.520]   So things are getting so bad,
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.280]   people are now multiplying wives.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.200]   Four, Paul's description of marriage
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.960]   as a picture of Christ and the church
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.840]   is seriously compromised by polygamy.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.840]   When Paul opens this truth, namely Genesis 2, 24,
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.520]   he describes it as a mystery.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.200]   Now, a mystery in Paul's language
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.520]   is something that was partly revealed in the Old Testament,
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.120]   but now has become clear.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.040]   And he says, this is Ephesians 5, 31,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.360]   "Therefore, a man shall leave his father and mother
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.640]   and hold fast to his wife,
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.360]   and the two shall become one flesh."
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.920]   This mystery is profound.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   And I am saying it refers to Christ and the church.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.920]   The most basic and significant meaning of marriage
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.680]   in the New Testament is that a husband and a wife
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.760]   represent one Lord and one church.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.360]   Since this is now more clearly revealed than ever,
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.260]   it is more important than ever to renounce polygamy
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.240]   and hold fast to the original intention of marriage
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.600]   as one man, one woman, one Lord, one church,
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.840]   as long as we, as long as they both shall live.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.200]   Five, "It is required of elders
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   that they be the husband of one wife," 1 Timothy 3, 2.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.520]   Now, probably that doesn't refer to polygamy
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.440]   because in 1 Timothy 5, 9,
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.240]   the same phrase is used to describe the widows
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.160]   who need to qualify for the care of the church.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.680]   And they are supposed to be wives of one husband,
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.760]   and there's no evidence that polyandry,
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.760]   multiple husbands, was a problem.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.800]   And therefore, wife of one husband, husband of one wife
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.280]   is probably not directly addressed to the issue of polygamy,
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.020]   but rather probably was addressed
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.080]   to be faithful to your spouse
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.880]   and don't be divorced from your spouse.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.280]   But here's the point.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.280]   Regarding polygamy, Paul never would have used those words
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.940]   without qualification if polygamy
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.120]   were being permitted in the church
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.600]   and among the leaders of the church.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.960]   He just never would have been able to use that language
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.200]   without some qualification.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   Six, finally, "The Bible does seem to show the likelihood
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.720]   that with more than one wife,
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.840]   there is almost inevitable favoritism
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.800]   of the one over the other,
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   as in the case of Jacob's preference for Rachel over Leah."
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.880]   In a sense, this is the flip side warning
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.320]   of saying that the husband and the wife are one flesh.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.760]   A husband cannot be all that he should be
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.080]   in one flesh union with his wife
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.080]   if he must divide his affections among several women.
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.960]   That's certainly not the way Christ treats the church.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.200]   He does not divide his affections
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.720]   among several different wives.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.940]   So for these six reasons and more, I am sure,
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.200]   I would say that polygamy was permitted
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.760]   because of the hardness of our hearts
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.160]   until the coming of Jesus,
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.120]   and that with Jesus, the standards are raised
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.040]   and the mystery of the meaning of marriage is clarified,
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.240]   and we should be committed to making plain
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.460]   the beauties of Christ and his church
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.820]   through our covenant faithfulness
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.320]   between one husband, one wife.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.920]   - Thank you for those points of clarity, Pastor John,

[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.640]   Well, why do we need to be forgiven?
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.820]   It's one of the most foundational questions in the world,
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.880]   and the question gets dozens of various answers,
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.480]   some good answers, some poor answers,
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.040]   and some false answers,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.000]   and John Piper will parse them out tomorrow
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.960]   and point us at the ultimate reason
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.720]   why we are offered forgiveness in Jesus Christ.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.560]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.600]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.660]   with John Piper.
