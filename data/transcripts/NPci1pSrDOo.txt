[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620]   Next, I have a bunch of things to run through, so I'm just going to get through it.
[00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.540]   So first, a couple weeks ago, there was an episode on lounges and accessing them.
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.080]   Two things that people sent in that I didn't mention.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.240]   One, there is a card that you can't get directly called the Ritz-Carlton card from Chase.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.320]   But if you do have one of the Bonvoy cards from Chase, you can change to it after a year.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.620]   And the reason I brought it up now is that people reminded me that it gets free authorized users
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.380]   and every cardholder has unlimited guests on Priority Pass.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.240]   So that is a really cool lounge card we didn't talk about.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.100]   And then the next thing is, I hope this isn't a trend,
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.840]   but it looks like a few of the Priority Pass lounges are starting to charge a fee
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.880]   on top of just having the Priority Pass membership.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.680]   I think the first one was the Virgin Lounge at LAX, but I just hope that's not a trend.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.620]   So that's a quick little follow-up to the lounge episode.
