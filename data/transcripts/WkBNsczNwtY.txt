[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   Welcome back to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast, answering your very tough theological
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.880]   and ethical questions from scripture.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.740]   Well, following Christ is costly and Jesus warns us to count the cost first before we
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.420]   follow him, which of course raises the big question, how?
[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.000]   How do we calculate the cost of following him?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.240]   A listener named Sally asks it like this.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.480]   Hello, Pastor John, and thank you for the podcast.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.320]   Christ tells us to forsake everything to be his disciple right after saying this, for
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.440]   which of you intending to build a tower does not sit down first and count the cost, whether
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.640]   he has enough to finish it.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.200]   Lest after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.560]   to mock him, saying, this man began to build and was not able to finish.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.180]   That is Luke 14 verses 20, 30.
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.920]   Within the call to be his disciple, how do we discern the cost and count that cost in
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.840]   each of our individual callings?
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.320]   Most significantly, how do we count the cost in advance when we do not know what cost will
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.660]   be exacted from us in the end?
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:18.820]   The problem here is that the verses which Sally refers to, Luke 14, 28 to 30, are sandwiched
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.120]   between the very verses that answer her question.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.600]   So to give Jesus' answer, let's back up two verses and go forward three verses.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.840]   So that's what I'm going to do.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.720]   Now let's just remind ourselves of the situation.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.360]   Jesus is calling people to follow him in discipleship, and then he's reminding them that it's like
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.500]   building a tower that you don't want to leave half finished because you don't have enough
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.960]   commitment or enough resources to finish it, and it's like going to war and realizing you
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.920]   don't have enough soldiers to win the battle and defeat the enemy.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.320]   So he says, be sure to count the cost before you sign up for discipleship with Jesus, because
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.720]   it's costly, and I don't want you to sign up naively and be surprised later when the
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.960]   cost is very high.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.600]   That's the gist of the situation she's pointing out, and that's right.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.640]   So Sally's asking, how do you count the cost when you don't know what's coming in your
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.640]   life?
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.760]   The answer is that Jesus requires up front a commitment to the highest possible cost.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.000]   Got that, Sally?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.660]   He requires commitment to the highest possible cost, and nothing later is going to surprise
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:50.760]   you then, because you've already totally sold to the highest, most excessive cost.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.960]   In other words, you don't need to know the specifics of the cost in your own particular
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.920]   case if the agreement you sign is, "I'm yours at any cost."
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.100]   That's exactly what these verses say, isn't it?
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.200]   Let's back up now.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.540]   So here's verses 26 to 27, just before the unit she cites, and he says this, "If anyone
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.200]   comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.080]   and sisters—yes, even his own life, the word was hate—he cannot be my disciple.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.900]   Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me, he cannot be my disciple."
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:41.860]   Now this is extreme language, the most extreme that he could use, I think, to show that the
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.480]   degree of the cost we may have to pay is extreme.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.960]   So the first extreme language is, "I am calling you to something that is going to
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.700]   look like hatred of wife and children and parents."
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.560]   And the second extreme language is, "I am calling you to get on a cross," which means
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.880]   a willingness to die an excruciating death.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.760]   It's not just a metaphor.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.240]   This is cross, meaning, "Join me on the way to martyrdom."
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:26.680]   So counting the cost of discipleship means realizing that authentic discipleship may
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:35.360]   exact from you the highest price relationally and the highest price physically.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.920]   Now let's go to the other side of the text and jump forward three verses.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:48.640]   Here's Luke 14.33, where Jesus ends the paragraph like this, "So therefore, any one of you
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.920]   who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple."
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.360]   Now there are two absolutes in that sentence.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.720]   One is found in the word "anyone."
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.520]   This applies to every disciple, not just a select few.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.440]   Any one of you who does not renounce all that he has.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.520]   That's the first absolute.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.880]   The other absolute is found in the word "all."
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.360]   You must renounce all that you have to be my disciple.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:25.160]   Your resources may stay in your sway as a manager, a steward, but you must be ready
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.880]   at any time to let go everything for Jesus' sake.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.520]   So when Sally asks, "How do we count the cost in advance when we don't know what the
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.680]   cost will be in advance?"
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:48.000]   The answer is, "You assume the cost could be total."
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.360]   All possessions given up, all relationships given up, all of life given up.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.600]   That's the expectation that Jesus calls for.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.560]   In other words, there's no negotiating here with Jesus.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.160]   There's no calculating.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.400]   There is no saying, "Well, if the cost reaches this, then I'm not interested in Jesus anymore."
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.080]   Because Jesus says, "You can't sign up that way.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.520]   Nobody signs up for 70% of what I require."
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.640]   That's not what disciples say.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.760]   We don't talk like that.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.760]   Hypocrites talk like that.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.760]   Well, no, hypocrites don't.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.140]   They lie.
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.400]   Disciples are all in or they're not in.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.160]   That's what the text is saying.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:39.880]   But let's make sure that Sally and the rest of us get this in right perspective, because
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:46.640]   just a few paragraphs earlier—this is the same chapter, 14, verse 14—Jesus said, after
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.320]   he laid down some pretty high costs, he said, "You will be repaid as the resurrection of
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.320]   the just."
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:07:00.040]   In other words, there's no cost that you can pay in following me that won't be made
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.800]   up to you a thousandfold in the resurrection.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.880]   And we need to remember Matthew 13, verse 44, which says that the kingdom of heaven
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.880]   is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man sees and sells everything he has—everything
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.160]   he has—to get that treasure.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:24.200]   In other words, all the so-called costs, all the so-called costs, like everything, all
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:32.040]   the so-called losses, everything, are nothing compared to the gains of having Jesus, the
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.280]   greatest treasure.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.180]   So yes, we must count the cost in order to be a disciple.
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:50.120]   The cost is total in principle, and may be total in actual experience, and in the end,
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.480]   having Jesus means gain.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:01.040]   Like Paul says, "I count everything as loss compared to the surpassing value of knowing
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.600]   Christ Jesus, my Lord."
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.600]   Amen.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:10.440]   So, costs and losses are nothing compared to the gains of having Jesus Christ as our
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.660]   final treasure.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.200]   That is pure gold, Pastor John.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   Thank you.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.360]   And, Sally, thanks for the very good and very specific question.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.920]   It's wonderfully articulated here.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.840]   And thank you to everyone who listens.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.600]   Regular listeners will already know this, but if you're new, you can subscribe to our
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.800]   audio feeds and search our past episodes in our archive.

[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:41.700]   On Wednesday, we return to talk about the fight against lust, a lifelong struggle for
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.140]   many listeners, the strongest temptation many of you face in life, and by far the most common
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.140]   ethical question we get in the APJ inbox.
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.680]   Next time, we're going to talk about two strategies for winning the war against lustful temptations.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.680]   You won't want to miss it.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.460]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.060]   I pose the questions, longtime pastor and author John Piper answers them.
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.500]   And together, we'll see you on Wednesday.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.500]   [end]
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:18.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
