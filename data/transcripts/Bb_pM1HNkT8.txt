[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.200]   the first epistle of Peter, in the first chapter.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.080]   And we are considering the section that begins at verse 13 and goes on to the end of the
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.000]   chapter, but particularly tonight perhaps, verse 17.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.760]   And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:36.320]   man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.040]   But as I say, I don't want merely to consider that particular verse, but rather to continue
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.040]   our study together on these Sunday evenings of this entire section in which the apostle
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.720]   Peter gives us an outline and a display of the essentials of the Christian gospel, the
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.040]   Christian message, the Christian faith.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.040]   Now he has exhorted the people to whom he is writing, and he exhorts all others to do
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:13.080]   the same, to gird up the lines of their mind.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.520]   Christianity isn't sub-stuff.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.960]   It isn't a mere riot of emotionalism.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.880]   It is something that calls for the exercise of all our faculties at their best and at
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.880]   their highest.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.400]   Gird up the lines of your mind.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.600]   One needs understanding to be a Christian.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.760]   Well then he goes on to give us various reasons why he thus calls upon us to gird up the lines
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.760]   of our mind.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.080]   And we are in the process of considering some of those reasons.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.800]   One reason which he gives is this.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.920]   We'd better pay careful attention to this because it delivers us, and it alone can deliver
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.600]   us from the kind of life that we all lead by nature.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.160]   He has described that as a life which is a life of ignorance, a life in which we fashion
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.400]   our conduct according to lusts.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.360]   That's the kind of life, he says, that men and women live by nature.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.120]   It's a vain conversation, an empty life, a bubble kind of life.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.680]   It's very marvelous and wonderful and attractive, as a bubble does.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.680]   But there's nothing in it.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.280]   It's full of air and it explodes and we are left with nothing.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.440]   Oh, he says, I exhort you, I plead with you to gird up the lines of your mind and listen
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.440]   to this message.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.840]   It will deliver you from that vain, ignorant, foolish life that all of mankind lives by
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.840]   nature.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.000]   But he doesn't stop at that.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.080]   We were seeing last Sunday night that he has a further reason which is this, that we are
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.520]   all in this life in a most precarious position.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.200]   We are living in what he calls the last time.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.440]   And our life in this world is nothing but what he calls a sojourning.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.360]   We are all travelers, my dear friends.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.480]   Need I stop to emphasize that on a remembrance day evening?
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.360]   We are all but pilgrims and strangers in this world.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.960]   Here today, gone tomorrow.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.520]   We've been looking back, we've been remembering loved ones and dear ones.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.920]   They're no longer here.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.080]   We'll soon be gone.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.320]   Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   Why?
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.240]   Well, because you see the teaching of this book is that there is to be a great event
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.240]   at the end of history.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.120]   History is not an endless process, it's coming to an end.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.640]   God started it, God will end it.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.960]   It will end with the appearing of the Son of God, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.940]   who will come back into this world to judge it in righteousness.
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.040]   And we shall all have to stand before him.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.400]   We are reminded that he will judge without respect of persons.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.680]   No favoritism, no special pleas will be recognized.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.000]   Every man's works shall be judged.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.200]   We shall be judged according to the way in which we've lived and conducted and comparted
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.800]   ourselves in this life.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:27.200]   We shall be judged by our reaction to the message of God and our relationship to him.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   It's a very solemn thought.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.960]   That's why he says you'd better gird up the lines of your mind.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.560]   You'd better start thinking.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.480]   You're not a spectator in this life, you're an actor.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.920]   You're involved in this and you can't evade it, you can't escape it.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.000]   Oh, he says, isn't it about time that you began to think?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.320]   And then we come on this evening to another reason.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.040]   And our reason this evening is a more positive one.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.360]   There, you see, in a sense we are being delivered from a vain conversation and from a judgment.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.360]   We need to be redeemed.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.600]   But let me give you, as the apostle holds it before us, let me give you this evening
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.400]   a very positive reason for girding up the lines of your mind and considering this message,
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.000]   this gospel, with all the energy that you're capable of, and all the keenness and all the
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.720]   power of concentration.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.720]   What is it?
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.400]   Well, it is this.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:34.520]   The gospel holds us face to face with what is in the last analysis our greatest need
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.440]   of all.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.920]   Now nobody would be foolish enough to dispute that we're all in need, that the whole world
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.040]   is in need.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.760]   If we don't realize that on a night like this, we'll never realize it.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.760]   Remembrance Day.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.760]   Remembering what?
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.360]   Well, especially two world wars.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.800]   But why does the world have wars?
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.000]   Why is there sorrow?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.440]   Why is there trouble?
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.720]   Why is there threat of yet more war?
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.400]   What's the matter?
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.240]   Oh, we have met together tonight and we all realize, I say, in a very acute manner, more
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.740]   acute perhaps than ever, if we think at all and are not just sentimentalists, we must
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.760]   realize that the world is in desperate need.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.880]   But the question is this.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.120]   What is the world's real need?
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.800]   What is our individual real urgent need this evening?
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   That's the question.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.280]   Now then, the answer of the gospel is that it alone can tell us this.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.640]   And that's another reason for girding up the lines of our mind and considering what it
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.020]   has to say.
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:07:00.680]   The gospel brings us face to face with our greatest, our most desperate need.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.120]   What is it, you think?
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.040]   What is man's greatest need?
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.760]   If I were to put that question to every member of this congregation at this moment, I wonder
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.280]   what your answer would be.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.080]   As you look at the world tonight, as you consider your own life, what is the supreme need of
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.840]   the human race, of every individual in it?
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.600]   Is it, you think, the abolition of arms and the outlawing of war?
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.960]   Is that the greatest need?
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.480]   It is a need, of course.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.800]   We all agree about that.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.960]   Only a lunatic can believe in war and defend it.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.320]   But is that the supreme need?
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.320]   It is that the greatest need of men.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:50.640]   Would all be well if all the nations of the world decided to destroy all their armaments
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.040]   and never build any more arms.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.760]   Would all be perfect?
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:02.760]   There are many who seem to think that, because they never talk about anything else.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.560]   That seems to be the one and only need.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.520]   And they will give their time and attention to it this evening beyond any question.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.440]   But I ask, is that the supreme need?
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.240]   Is that the real need?
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.320]   There are others who say, "No, what I need is comfort."
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.280]   I've lost some dear one.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.120]   "Oh, what I need is comfort."
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.560]   Do you think, my friend, that even your greatest need is that of comfort?
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.560]   We all need comfort.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.440]   Yes, but I'm asking, is that the supreme need?
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.560]   Is that the ultimate need?
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.280]   Is that the real need?
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.280]   Many of us think it is.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.440]   And others say, "Oh, what I need is health.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.440]   I've lost my health.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.520]   If only I had my health back, how perfect everything would be."
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.960]   Is that the real, is that the supreme need?
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.920]   Well, go and ask many a healthy man and woman this evening, and you'll find that many of
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.520]   them are very miserable and unhappy.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.520]   They've got the health, but they haven't got the thing they need.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.320]   And so, I could give you a whole list of things which men and women are putting forward as
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.320]   the supreme need.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.280]   There are some foolish people who say, "All I need is plenty of money.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.780]   If only I had money, then my life would be perfect."
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.240]   They don't know, you know, that there are many miserable millionaires in the world at
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:28.520]   this moment, who are trying to buy and to find happiness, but can't.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.800]   Oh, there are endless possibilities that men and women put up.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.000]   "If only I could have this.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.200]   This one wants to get married.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.120]   The other one wishes that they'd never got married."
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.660]   That's the supreme thing.
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.760]   And so, you go the round of all these possibilities.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.280]   What does it all come to?
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.840]   Well, what it all comes to is this, you see.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.240]   These are not the supreme need of mankind.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.800]   And the business of the gospel is to bring us face to face with our supreme need, our
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.840]   ultimate need, our greatest need of all.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.920]   And it isn't, I say, any particular blessing.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.340]   Do you know what it is?
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:16.400]   It is this, to know God.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:24.280]   That is man's ultimate supreme need, the knowledge of God.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.880]   Why do I say this?
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.280]   Can I justify my contention?
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.520]   Well, I can, very simply indeed.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:41.120]   This is the supreme need, for instance, for this reason, that all our other needs and
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:47.040]   problems and troubles stem from this one.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.560]   Take this question of war.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.720]   Why are there wars?
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.960]   Why do men fight one another?
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.680]   And there's only one answer to the question.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:02.160]   It is because they're all out of the right relationship to God.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.880]   God made a perfect world, and when he put men into it, everything was perfect.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.360]   There was no strife, there was no conflict, there never would have been a war.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.800]   War was never intended in God's creation.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.240]   Why is there war?
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.600]   Simply because men, instead of bowing their knees together and acknowledging the supreme
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.160]   God, have put themselves up as gods, and it's a fight between gods.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.160]   Everyone wants to be supreme.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.760]   That's why you've got wars.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.440]   You see, it's due to one thing only, that men doesn't know God, and isn't in the
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.840]   right relationship to God.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.000]   I call it the supreme need.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.080]   I don't care what need you may mention to me.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.720]   Where does ill health come from?
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.720]   Because men sin.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.160]   There would have been no ill health if men hadn't sinned.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.600]   Where does unhappiness come from?
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   Same source.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.920]   Everything comes from this source.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.800]   I defy you to mention a single particular need.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:59.000]   But that ultimately you will be able to trace it back to this fundamental need of a knowledge
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.120]   of God and a right relationship to him.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:10.440]   Secondly, isn't it obvious that our supreme need is God for this reason?
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.720]   That everything else has been tried and has failed.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.840]   I say deliberately everything.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.080]   The ingenuity and the ability of men has been implied throughout the centuries in trying
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:31.480]   to solve this problem of men in this world, men living in this life, men trying to get
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.200]   rid of the things that get him down and defeat him.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:42.800]   The whole story of civilization has in a sense been the search for happiness, the search
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:49.000]   for peace, the search for a life which is life indeed.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Every power that men possesses has gone into the past.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.600]   It's the story of the great philosophers.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.200]   It's the story of all the great statesmen.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.520]   It is the story, I say, of all human endeavor.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.180]   And yet the world is as it is tonight.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.000]   Everything else has been tried.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.120]   One thing is still not being tried.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.080]   The knowledge of God, the return to him.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.920]   Don't you see that the logic of this is inevitable?
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.920]   We've tried everything else.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.920]   Isn't it about time we turn to God?
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.760]   And then let me give you a third reason for this.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.600]   And it's one that the Bible emphasizes everywhere.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.920]   Whether we believe it or not and whether we like it or not, the fact is that we are all
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:46.960]   in God's hands.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.400]   And we can't shake him off.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:57.280]   And indeed the Bible has much evidence to teach us this.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.960]   That it is because we are at one and the same time in God's hands and yet antagonistic to
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:09.400]   him that we are experiencing so much of what we are experiencing.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.040]   God has made us for himself.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.520]   He meant us to live in a given way.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:19.200]   And he has decreed that we shall not be happy until we are in the right relationship.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.200]   So fight as we will and struggle and endeavor.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   We'll never find peace.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.720]   There is no peace.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.520]   Saith my God to the wicked.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:36.360]   Isn't it time that the world began to gird up the lines of its mind and to think?
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:42.920]   And to try to discover whether this isn't the answer after all, to be right with God?
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.480]   And then let me give you a last reason which is this one.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:53.520]   He alone has the power and the ability to bless us.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.480]   Man is always trying to bless himself.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.160]   The state is trying to bless us all.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.240]   It's always making lavish promises.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.320]   We've just had a recent exhibition of that.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.640]   How each party has been trying to bribe us by giving us more of this and that.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.040]   But they can't give it us.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:13.600]   They can give us more money but probably the effect of that will be to increase our misery.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.360]   We'll drink more or we'll gamble more or we'll do this or that more.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.160]   We've never been so prosperous but are we happier?
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.360]   Is the heart more at rest and at ease?
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.240]   Are we living as we were meant to live?
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.720]   Are we proud of ourselves?
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.720]   Are we satisfied?
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.720]   We know we're not.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:39.760]   Man hasn't the power, the ability to bless himself nor his fellow human beings.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.400]   We need someone above us, greater than us, endless, illimitable in his resources and
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:53.040]   that is God who is the source and the fount of every blessing.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.800]   Well there I've hurriedly given you some reason for saying that what the Bible asserts is
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.520]   the simple and plain truth that the supreme need of mankind and of the individual in the
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.960]   race is to know God.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.500]   Now then, I say that we must gird up the lines of our mind because here is a message confronting
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:21.080]   us that says that in it and it alone can give us this.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.720]   Is there somebody I ask looking for comfort and consolation?
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.360]   My dear friend, God alone can give it you.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.080]   You know that nobody else can.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.080]   The world can't.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.080]   Your nearest and dearest, your friends can't.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:38.600]   They can be kind, they can be sympathetic, but you need something deeper and the world
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   can't give it you.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.880]   I say God can.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.080]   Whatever you need, it is a need that God alone can supply.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.840]   So the great problem that's confronting everybody this evening therefore is this.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.040]   How can I know God?
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.560]   How can I be blessed by God?
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:59.560]   You know men and women in extremity, they always realize this by a kind of instinct.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.320]   Do you remember the stories we used to read during the last war of men, merchant, men
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.800]   in the merchant navy suddenly torpedoed in mid-Atlantic?
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.760]   They'd get into their little boats, into their dinghies, and there they'd be perhaps
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:16.600]   for days upon end, supply of food ending, water ending, and there they were.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.600]   What did they do?
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.480]   Well, they were honest enough to tell us.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:25.160]   They suddenly remembered God and they began to pray.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.520]   Oh deep down you see in the human heart there is a sense of God.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.080]   It's in everybody.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.840]   And in extremity men begin to pray, but the moment he tries to he says, "How can I pray?
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.840]   What is God like?
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.840]   Who is God?
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.840]   What is He?
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.840]   What is God?"
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.840]   And thus we are ignorant.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.400]   We feel, "Ah, man has failed.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   Nobody can help me.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.440]   Is there a supreme being?
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.600]   How can I get at Him?
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.600]   How can I find Him?
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.680]   How can I ask Him?"
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:52.800]   The desire to know and to pray to God, yes, that is the supreme need this evening.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.360]   The need that governs and controls every lesser, every particular need.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:04.880]   Well now, the answer of this book, as the Apostle Peter reminds us here, is this.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:12.120]   That it is this Christian message alone that can bring us to that knowledge of God.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:17.000]   Now I'm repeating that because it's the first thing we've got to learn.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.640]   There is no knowledge of God apart from what we have in this book.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.360]   Now listen to Peter putting it in this very section we are considering in verse 21.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:32.040]   He's talking about the Lord Jesus Christ, who verily he says was foreordained before
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:40.760]   the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you who by Him do
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.760]   you believe in God.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:48.160]   Yes, by Him you believe in God.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.680]   There is no other way of truly believing in God but by Him.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.520]   Now that is the assertion of this Apostle here.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.160]   The Apostle Paul is equally explicit in writing to the Corinthians.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.640]   In his first epistle, in his first chapter, he puts it like this.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:11.520]   He says, "The world by wisdom," which means philosophy, "the world by wisdom, knew not
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.520]   God."
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:17.880]   Now that's a dogmatic statement, but it's the simple truth.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.560]   The Apostle Paul was familiar with Greek philosophy, and he knew that that great succession of
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:27.040]   philosophers had been concerned with this problem, the knowledge of God.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.080]   They had this intimation, this feeling within them, and they sought Him, but they couldn't
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.080]   find Him.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:38.680]   "The world by wisdom knew not God."
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.040]   It failed completely.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.440]   It had failed before the Lord Jesus Christ ever came into this world.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.560]   Well, of course, the prologue of John's Gospel tells us exactly the same thing.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.000]   "No man hath seen God at any time."
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.400]   That's the trouble.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:02.120]   "No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.160]   He dwelleth in a light which is unapproachable.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.920]   He is a burning fire.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.040]   God, He's too far away.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.040]   No man hath seen Him.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:19.240]   No man can arrive and aspire to scale the heights on which God dwells and is and reigns
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:24.000]   from eternity to eternity."
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.320]   The Apostle Paul once more quite plainly said this, didn't he, to that distinguished congregation
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:34.160]   that listened to him in Athens, a congregation of Stoics and Epicureans.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:43.840]   He says, "I know that you've all been seeking after Him, if happily you might seek Him and
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:49.960]   find Him, yes, if happily, but you haven't found Him.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.200]   I've been in your city, your great city, a few days now," says the Apostle, "and I've
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.600]   walked round and I've been impressed by one thing above everything else, the multiplicity
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.640]   of temples in your great city.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.040]   You've got a temple to every possible God."
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.240]   That seems to indicate to me, says the Apostle, that you're not very satisfied.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:13.680]   "And I noticed one extraordinary temple with this strange inscription over it, 'To the
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.120]   unknown God.'"
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:22.160]   Ah, you've got a temple to the God of war, to the God of peace, to the God of love.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.200]   You've got a temple to the God of nature, to the God of the harvest.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.000]   You've got a temple to every conceivable, but then you've built this other one, the
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.920]   unknown God, you're quite right.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:35.360]   You've got a feeling, haven't you, that behind all your gods there is the God, this almighty
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.800]   God, but you can't find Him.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.280]   You call Him the unknown God.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:44.680]   "Do you know what I'm doing," says Paul, "whom ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.680]   you."
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.680]   That's it.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:54.200]   There is no knowledge of God apart from this message.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.160]   I mustn't keep you this evening in outlining to you and reminding you of the ways in which
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:03.440]   men have tried to seek and to find God.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.600]   Some have tried it by pure philosophy, the five proofs, you remember, the classical five
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.200]   proofs that took so much of the time of the philosophers of the Middle Ages, the five
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.680]   absolute proofs of the being of God.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.600]   Yes, they'll bring you to the end of an argument, a syllogism, but will they bring you to a
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:31.160]   knowledge of God, the uncaused cause, the design, the order, the arrangement of all
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.160]   these arguments?
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:38.800]   Others have sought Him through history, others have sought Him through some subjective contemplation,
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:44.520]   some inward process of reasoning out of themselves.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.000]   Never a man has found satisfaction in that way.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.640]   I'm not saying that these arguments are valueless.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.160]   I believe they have an apologetic value, but I say they don't bring a man to an experience,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.320]   a knowledge of the living God.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.880]   They tell us things about Him, but they don't bring us to Him.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.960]   Man is certainly without excuse for not believing in God.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.480]   As the apostle argues in writing to the Romans, "Look at creation and nature," he says, "there
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:13.040]   is the handiwork of God, the visible things, they're there, why not look at them?"
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.400]   But man can't do it.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.560]   Man has failed to do it.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.880]   Though God has given him the signs and the suggestions, they're not enough to bring him
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.640]   to a knowledge of God.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.800]   They should bring him to a knowledge of God as creator, but they don't even do that.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:33.400]   Man by all his methods has tried and tried, but he's never succeeded.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:47.600]   Man by searching cannot, has not, found God because he dwells away there in the infinities
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.600]   in eternity.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.480]   There is only one hope.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:57.840]   And that is that God should be graciously pleased to reveal Himself to us.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.640]   It's the only hope.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.320]   Man's finite, man's limited, man's sinful, and God is infinite and holy, the thing's
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.320]   impossible.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.840]   "Well, why not admit it, my friend?
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.280]   Why not," I say, "God, up the lines of your mind, go and read your philosophers, come
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.400]   to the conclusion at once by seeking.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.680]   You'll never find Him.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.880]   He's beyond you.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.440]   He eternally eludes man."
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.400]   There's only one hope, that He should be graciously pleased and condescend to reveal
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.400]   Himself.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.720]   Do you know what the message of this book is?
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.080]   It is to tell us that He's done so.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.960]   That's exactly the content of the Bible.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.800]   God has been pleased to reveal and to manifest Himself.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.600]   He's done it in many ways.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.960]   He did it, you see, through speaking to the fathers.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.800]   He made the nation of the Jews.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   Be clear about that.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   The great message of the Jews as a nation is that there is God.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.080]   He made them for Himself.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.200]   The whole story is a revelation of God.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.680]   He gave the Ten Commandments.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.680]   He gave them our law.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   It's God revealing Himself.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.680]   That's what it all is about.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.680]   The prophets, the psalmists, revealing God.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.240]   They were not giving a description of God that they'd conjured up.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.600]   God gave them the revelation.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.600]   They gave it to men.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:13.240]   Oh, but we're not left with that.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.320]   There is something that makes all that pale into insignificance, in a sense.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.320]   What is it?
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.400]   What the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts at the very beginning of his great epistle
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:30.080]   in these words, "God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:36.120]   unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son,
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:41.960]   whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the world, who being
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:47.640]   the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:53.040]   by the word of His power, when He hath by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.560]   hand of the Majesty on high."
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.280]   That's it.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.960]   That is this message.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.200]   That God is to be known in and through this person.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.920]   It is the only way.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.360]   Listen to the way in which he put it to that great man Nicodemus.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.880]   "Jesus answered and said unto him, 'Art thou a master of Israel and understandest not
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.880]   these things?
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:26.080]   Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:31.160]   seen, and you receive not our witness.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:38.560]   No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.560]   men which is in heaven.'"
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.800]   That's the only way.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:50.640]   A man can't know God by his own striving, because he can't ascend into heaven very well.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.440]   God has sent one out of heaven.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:58.240]   That's Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.560]   He has entered into this world of time.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.760]   He has come amongst us.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.480]   He has tabernacled amongst us.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.480]   What for?
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.800]   Well, here is the answer again.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.800]   I go back to John 1, chapter 18.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:15.400]   "No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten who is in the bosom of the Father.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.120]   He has declared Him."
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.280]   Did you hear it in the reading at the beginning in John 14?
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.360]   Philip, have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me?
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.280]   He who hath seen me hath seen the Father.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.600]   Here is the one and only way of knowing God.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.120]   My dear friend, this is why I invite you to listen to this gospel.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.920]   You are supreme need is to know God, and you can't know God except in this way, through
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.920]   this person.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.320]   "The Son hath declared Him."
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.320]   What has he declared?
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.960]   What is the revelation?
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.000]   What is the knowledge that has been given?
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.080]   Let me summarize it for you.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.960]   We've got it in this section that we're looking at this evening.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:20.880]   It is written, "Be ye holy, for I am holy."
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.760]   That is the revelation that is given.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.560]   What was the revelation given by the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.560]   Listen to Him praying.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.520]   Here He is, He has become a man.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.560]   He has limited Himself.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.200]   He dwells amongst us.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.840]   He knows the needs, the troubles.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.840]   He has to pray.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.160]   He gets up a great while before dawn and He prays to His Father.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.920]   He needs special help and strength.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.760]   How does He address Him?
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.800]   "Holy Father."
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:51.880]   There's a terrible contrast between the way the Lord Jesus Christ prayed and you and I
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.880]   pray.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.480]   You know what we do, don't you?
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.240]   We've all done it.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.560]   Weeks and months and years perhaps have passed and we've forgotten all about God.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.960]   When somebody is taken ill, a little child or a wife or a husband, and we're desperate,
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.320]   the doctors seem to be failing, we get on our knees and we pray to God.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.160]   We don't address Him as "Holy God or Father."
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.200]   We feel we've got a right, we have ration.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.520]   The Son of God didn't.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.800]   No, no, you see, He knew God.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.560]   He'd come from God.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.480]   No man hath ascended into heaven.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.040]   He that has come down descended from heaven.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:33.080]   He alone, He knows God and He knows that God is absolutely holy and so He addresses Him
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:37.200]   as "Holy Father."
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:44.600]   The revelation that God has given to us about Himself is this, that He is a God who hates
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:55.120]   sin, He hates evil, He hates drunkenness, He hates immorality, He hates selfishness,
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:00.720]   He hates injustice, He hates vice, He hates the thing in which people gloat and of which
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.120]   they boast, He hates the things that are put on the front pages of the newspaper as if
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.880]   they were wonderful and as if that were like, God hates it.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.920]   He's told us that.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:18.280]   Everything that is impure and unclean, He abominates it.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:24.360]   God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.280]   Can't live in His presence.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.160]   It's impossible for it to exist anywhere near Him.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.720]   He's a burning fire.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:40.920]   That is the revelation that God has given of Himself through Moses and the Ten Commandments,
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:45.440]   through the psalmists, the prophets and above all through His only begotten dearly beloved
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.440]   Son.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.560]   He's a God who hates sin and who's going to punish sin.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.880]   He said so and He never breaks His word.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.400]   He has punished sin.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.960]   Read the Bible, you'll see He's punished it throughout the centuries.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.720]   He says He will.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:05.520]   And we know that we are all sinners, don't we?
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:11.440]   The greatest sin of all is to forget God and to live a single day without worshipping Him.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:16.160]   Very well then, here is our problem.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.160]   We need Him, we need the blessings that He alone can give.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.880]   And yet if that is God and I see what I am, oh how can I go to Him?
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.880]   How can I pray?
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.920]   How can I be blessed by God?
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.800]   It's my supreme need, I see it now.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.160]   How can I get there?
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.000]   And again my dear friend, there's only one answer in the world tonight and it's the answer
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.160]   that's given in this book.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.120]   There is only one way I say to the Father.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.480]   I need to be reconciled to Him.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.840]   I need to be forgiven by Him.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.040]   I need my old enmity against Him to be removed.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:56.440]   I need His abhorrence of what I am by nature to be taken away.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.160]   How can it be done?
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.080]   There's only one way, it's all in this section.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:07.400]   For as much as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, such as silver and
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:14.280]   gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers, well how then?
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:21.440]   Well with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:26.440]   who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, that was manifest in these last
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:32.400]   times for you, who by Him do believe in God that raised Him from the dead and gave Him
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.600]   glory.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:41.640]   It's a night when we think of men sacrificing their lives.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.320]   All honor to any man who's ever done so.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.880]   All honor to a man who loves honor and who loves his country in the right way and who's
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:33:00.560]   ready to die for justice and honor and truth and righteousness amongst men and nations.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:07.600]   But if you're interested in sacrifice, if you really want to contemplate a shedding
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:19.600]   of blood that causes everything else to recede to nothing, go and look, I say, at that cross
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:27.440]   on a hill called Calvary and see there the Son of God dying, bleeding.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.440]   What for?
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:35.800]   Oh, that you and I might be reconciled to God, that we might come to know God, that
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:41.120]   we might have peace with God, that the old enmity might be removed.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.440]   God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.440]   That's the message.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.440]   It's the only hope.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.440]   It's the only way to know God.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.600]   God and man must be reconciled.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.200]   God Himself has done it.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:59.200]   God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing to them their trespasses.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.200]   How has He done it?
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:05.560]   He hath made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.640]   of God in Him.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.640]   That's the message.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.000]   That's why I say, goad up the lines of your mind.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.360]   This is the thing you need.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.360]   You need to know God.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.360]   You need to be blessed by God.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.360]   You can't while your sin is between you.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.360]   The sin must be taken away.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:28.920]   There's only one who can, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the whole world.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:33.560]   But here, you see, we are told as to how it can be done, but it doesn't stop at that,
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.560]   thank God.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:39.560]   I need to be introduced to God.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.560]   I need to know God.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:45.440]   I've told you all too briefly how it's to be done.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.800]   But you know this is a wonderful message.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:54.680]   Christianity is not merely a message that offers us forgiveness.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.720]   It takes us well beyond that.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:14.360]   Listen to this, "If ye call on the Father, the Father," verse 17, "here is a message
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:22.440]   that not only tells you that you can be reconciled to God and be at peace with God, but that
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.440]   God is your Father."
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.560]   "Ah," says somebody, "I've always believed in that, the universal Fatherhood of God and
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.440]   the universal brotherhood of men."
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.160]   Don't you run away with any such notion, my friends.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.640]   The Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, looked at certain people and said, "You are of your
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:44.760]   Father the devil, and the works of your Father he will do."
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:53.520]   There is no such thing as the universal Fatherhood of God.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.480]   The Lord Jesus Christ also said this, did you notice it in the reading at the beginning
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.480]   out of John 14?
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.000]   "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.720]   God is not the Father of those who live a life of sin in opposition to him and at enmity
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.200]   against him.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.520]   No, no.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:24.680]   They belong to the devil.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:29.600]   It is only the man who comes to him in Jesus Christ to whom God is Father.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.640]   The apostle says, therefore, to the Ephesians, you see, "You are no longer strangers and
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:38.920]   foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God."
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.880]   You were not of the household of God but you are now in Christ who has reconciled you,
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.880]   who has made peace.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.060]   He has brought you into the household of God.
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.060]   God is your Father.
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:51.280]   My dear friend, can't you see that this is the supreme need of everybody in the world
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.280]   tonight?
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.200]   That God is your Father.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:59.040]   It means that he loves you, he knows you, he is interested in you, he cares for you.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.600]   The very hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.720]   Nothing can happen to you apart from him.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:07.640]   Isn't that what you need?
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:17.240]   When you feel lonely and defeated, when you feel isolated and bereft, is there anything
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.160]   possible greater than this?
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.160]   That God is your Father.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:34.520]   Oh, not only this great God that dwells in the eternity, he has become your Father.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:39.080]   And he loves you with an everlasting love.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:44.520]   He loved you so much that he sent his only begotten Son into the world to redeem you
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.920]   and to rescue you and to bring you into this blessed relationship.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:55.800]   If you call on the Father, this is prayer, you know.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:00.680]   Not addressing whatever gods may be, not frantically rushing, not knowing what you are saying,
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:04.840]   not uttering words without thought, no, no.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:10.000]   Realizing that you are going to one who is your Father, who knows all about you, who
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.320]   is watching over you, caring for you as a human parent looks after that little helpless
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:20.360]   child, watching it lest it fall, getting there before it, making provision, anticipating.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.840]   God, Father.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:29.320]   If only men and women came to this knowledge, oh, how our world would be transformed.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.680]   Let me use the other term.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.880]   Peter has used it here in a previous verse.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.720]   He says, "Wherefore, God, up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:41.560]   the grace that is to be brought into you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.560]   children."
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.440]   You see, it's the other side of fatherhood, isn't it?
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.040]   But I, as somebody, again, have always believed it.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.360]   Universal fatherhood, universal brotherhood, nonsense.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.480]   No, no.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.960]   Again that first chapter of John puts it far enough.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:03.160]   It says, "The greatest tragedy in the world is this, that the Lord Jesus Christ came unto
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.000]   his own and his own received him not.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:17.520]   But unto as many as received him, he gave power, authority, to become the children of
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.040]   God."
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.360]   Everybody isn't a child of God.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.520]   Everybody's been created by God, but that's a very different thing.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.840]   Everybody is not a child of God.
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:31.760]   "No, no," says the message, "it is those who receive Jesus Christ.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:41.080]   God gives them the authority, the right to become the children of God, the sons of God."
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:45.720]   And unless we believe this message concerning the Son of God who came into this world to
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:50.120]   lay down his life for sinners and to rise again, we are not children of God.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.880]   But if we believe it, we are.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.920]   And you see, this is how it works.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:40:03.440]   It means that we now can go into the presence of God as children.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:09.040]   We no longer go into the presence of God as if he were some super, super, super general
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:14.080]   manager who's got our faith in his hands and who hates us and wants to keep us down.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.080]   No, no.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.400]   We go and knock at the door as a little child knocks at the door of his father, whatever
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.920]   he may be doing.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:25.000]   The little child doesn't care whether he's busy and dealing with great matters, his father.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   And he wants him and he knocks at the door.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.400]   And the father gets up and opens and smiles.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.000]   The little child has come in.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Children, as children, as obedient children.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.080]   My dear friend, isn't this what you'd like?
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:42.240]   In your agony of soul, in your desperation, in your unhappiness when your heart is breaking,
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:46.520]   in your bereavement and your sorrow, wouldn't you like as a little child just to rush to
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:52.440]   your father and be enfolded in his arms and all your grief would be forgotten and he'd
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.400]   pat you on your back and dry your tears?
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.400]   That is what is offered by this gospel.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.400]   Father.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.400]   Children.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:06.440]   Yes, I've anticipated, you know, the next thing which is just this.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.840]   I'm only going to note it.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.000]   Did you notice this extraordinary expression in verse 17?
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.760]   "And if ye call on the Father."
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   That's it.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.760]   Prayer.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.760]   That is prayer.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.400]   Calling on the Father.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.960]   Oh, what loose talk there is about prayer.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:31.080]   I suppose that more nonsense is talked about prayer than about anything else in the world.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:35.160]   You know, I even hear Christian people sometimes saying, and sometimes they give me the impression
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.360]   that they think that they're very spiritual because they can put it like that.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.360]   They say, "Let's have a word of prayer."
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:52.360]   You don't speak about it like that if you know what you're doing.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.360]   Would you stand outside Buckingham Palace and suddenly turn to somebody and say, "I'm
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.240]   going to interrupt the word of the Queen."
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.240]   You try it.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:06.760]   Yes, but multiply your Queen by infinity and yet you talk about having a word of prayer.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.360]   No, no.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.680]   No, no.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:18.280]   There's only one way of being able to call on the Father.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.520]   I mean by that, knowing that you're going to enter into his presence.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:26.560]   If you call upon somebody, you see, you go in and you're received and you speak, don't
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.560]   you?
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.400]   Yes, and you're going in because you need something.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:33.280]   You want to utter a cry, you've got a petition, and you must see them and you want to get
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.280]   in.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.280]   Call upon the Father.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:41.000]   There's only one way.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.840]   The author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it like this, twice in his epistle, "Seeing
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:54.680]   therefore that we have a great high priest that is passed through the heavens, Jesus,
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.920]   the Son of God."
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.920]   What happens?
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.560]   "Well," he says, "he's able to sympathize with us.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.720]   He's been tempted in all points like us.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.680]   We are yet without sin.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:14.240]   Let us therefore in the light of that come boldly, with confidence, unto the throne of
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.080]   grace."
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.080]   And without that you can't come.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.680]   "Who are you to want to enter into the eternal presence?
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:26.080]   Who am I to make a call on God and to cry out my need?
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.080]   I dare not.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.800]   I shrivel into nothing at the thought of him.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:36.960]   There's only one way where I can go in boldly, and that is to know that he is my Father and
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:42.560]   that I am his child and that there is one there with him representing me.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.480]   To introduce me, a great intercessor, a great high priest.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:50.600]   Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace."
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:55.880]   And then he later puts it like this, "Therefore," he says, "seeing therefore, brethren, beloved,
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:01.640]   that we can enter into the holiest of all."
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:06.520]   That's where God lives, in the holiest of all.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.520]   How can I enter there?
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:13.840]   There is only one way, by the blood of Jesus.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:18.720]   But by the blood of Jesus I can go with full assurance of faith, with full assurance of
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.720]   hope.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.360]   I can go with an absolute confidence with a holy boldness.
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:28.560]   The blood of Christ has given me a right of entry into the presence of God.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:34.160]   All the men he has posted, the angels he has posted, upon the way and at every door, they
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.240]   inspect everybody who comes.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.240]   And you know what they look for?
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:41.800]   The mark of the blood.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:47.120]   And if the mark of the blood of Christ is on you, the doors are opened, you are ushered
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.120]   in.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:57.680]   "Therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest of all by the blood of Jesus."
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:03.160]   And without his blood you have no access, you have no entry, you have no hope.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:07.880]   So that in your need you can't cry out, but with the blood of Jesus you can.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.000]   You can come into the presence of God.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   What you need?
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   You need mercy.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.840]   "Let us therefore," says this man, "come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.600]   obtain mercy."
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.160]   You will get it by the blood of Jesus.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.200]   God will smile upon you.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.120]   His law has been satisfied.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.120]   All is well.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.120]   He will love you.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.120]   He will look upon you.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.440]   He will give you his mercy.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:35.720]   Not only that, you need grace to help in time of need.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:39.560]   And you and I are living in a terrible time of need.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.720]   And life defeats us.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.640]   And we are all weak and we go down to the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.840]   And we need strength and power, grace to help in time of need.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:55.040]   Sorrow comes, bereavement comes, a son is killed in a war, another one dies when there
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.040]   is no war.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.040]   "Oh, what can I do?
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.040]   I am in need.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.040]   I am desperate.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.320]   The world can't help me.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.360]   I need grace to help in time of need.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.920]   And there is only one who can give it me, and it is God.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:15.760]   And I can go and call upon him in the name of Jesus Christ and by the blood of Christ.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.320]   And he will give it me.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:20.040]   And I need strength to live a holy life.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:24.040]   Be ye holy, he says, past the time of your sojourning here in fear.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.520]   Yes, it is possible.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.000]   He gives me his spirit.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.560]   He gives me a new nature.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.480]   He gives me strength and power.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.960]   He makes me a partaker of his own nature.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:41.360]   Whatever my need, whatever my condition, I have but to cry out unto him.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.440]   Did you hear the apostle Paul saying it to those Philippians?
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:50.080]   I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.360]   I know both how to be abased and to how to abound.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.560]   I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.840]   It's been very kind of you, Philippians, he says, to send me a gift.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:02.560]   You know, most people forgot all about me.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.560]   You didn't.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.560]   You sent me a gift.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.560]   You sent me another one.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.560]   I'm very grateful.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.560]   Not that I speak in respect of one.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.560]   Don't think I'm asking for more, says Paul.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.040]   You know, I've learned this blessed lesson.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.760]   I don't care whether I'm in prison or out of prison.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:19.240]   I don't care whether I have a superabundance or whether I'm in penury.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:24.440]   Whatever my state, I have learned therein to be content.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:30.360]   I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.360]   I have all.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.600]   I have bound.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.760]   I have more than enough.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:45.200]   And my God shall supply you at every need through the abundance of his riches in Christ
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.200]   Jesus.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:53.520]   Isn't that the sort of life you'd like to live?
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:56.520]   You gather together all your particular individual needs.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.720]   You see, they're all brought into one here.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:05.440]   If you know God and if you're under his blessing, you have all of them and infinitely more.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:09.320]   Everything you need while you're left in this world.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:21.240]   And then the day will come when you will have to die.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.240]   What then?
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.800]   Can the world help you?
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.440]   Can your nearest and dearest die with you or die for you?
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:34.160]   Can all the knowledge and the culture and the arts and all the statesmen, can they help
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.160]   you when you're dying?
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.160]   Of course they can.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.160]   They don't know how to die themselves.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.160]   And nobody can be with you.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.160]   You're alone at the moment of death.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.160]   What of it?
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:57.520]   There's only one thing to do.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:10.600]   Let my anxious fear subside.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.600]   Death of deaths and hell's destruction.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.600]   Land me safe on Canaan's side.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.600]   Call upon him.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.280]   Cry out unto him.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:19.280]   Even in the agony of death, he'll be with you.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:26.760]   Call thou thy cross before my closing eyes.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:33.120]   Light through the gloom and lead me through and to the skies.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:41.640]   Heaven's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.640]   Help of the helpless.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:49.440]   O abide with me.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:50.440]   Guide me.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:53.920]   O thou great Jehovah.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.720]   Pilgrim through this barren land.
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:03.560]   I am weak, but thou art mighty.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.360]   Hold me, hold me.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:14.360]   With thy powerful hand, bread of heaven, feed me now.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:21.040]   And evermore, cry out, call on the Father.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:27.760]   And he'll answer you, supply your every need in life and in death.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:33.680]   And receive you to be with him in glory throughout eternity.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.800]   Amen.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.760]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
