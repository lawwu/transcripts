[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   As we mentioned in the previous podcast, we recently hosted a pastors conference
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.880]   here in the Twin Cities in February. It was about the supernatural in ministry,
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.160]   and Pastor John, what were some of your conference takeaways? The whole
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:26.360]   conference was about, brothers, we are not professionals, and the nub of it came
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:34.280]   out when Jason Meier said in his message, "There is no
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.240]   professional fear and trembling." And he was talking about his taking up the
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.600]   mantle of the pastor at Bethlehem, and Paul said he came to the church in
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.880]   Corinth with much fear and trembling, and he said it was of the essence of
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.640]   faith, because Philippians 2 says we're supposed to work out our salvation with
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.000]   fear and trembling, and yet when you stop and think about it, that would be
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.480]   something that no professional seminar would give you ten steps to fear and
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:14.080]   trembling. So that's the gist of it. The things we're called to do as pastors are
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.120]   done in ways that rely upon the supernatural and awaken in us
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.840]   affections that are essential for doing the ministry, like fear and trembling,
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.600]   humility, love, kindness, and these are things that are just not considered
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.200]   professional in our day. They're not evil, viewed by evil as professionals. I'm just
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.640]   so eager that the pastors not give way to their self-identity as a professional,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.440]   because all of the essential things in the ministry are of such a nature that
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.640]   we wouldn't describe them as professional. The pursuit of the power of
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.800]   the Holy Spirit is the essence of the matter, and not being professional.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.360]   We want to be the kind of ministers who rely not upon ourselves and our
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.400]   expertise and our excellence and our skills, but upon the Holy Spirit. And
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.800]   what came out in the conference was that that's done in very ordinary ways. I
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.280]   think my talk was an example of that, where you meditate on the Word of God by
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.600]   trying to say things in a most effective and compelling way. That's a
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.160]   very natural process in one sense, and yet if you do it with humble, childlike
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.400]   prayerfulness, crying out to God that he would bring to your mind the things that
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.960]   need to be said, then you can see what a switch it takes from professionalism. And
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.720]   the extraordinary came out in both Mac Stiles' talk and in Topik Kalioso's
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.920]   talk, and Mac gave this illustration. This is just classic, non--you can't
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.880]   plan or professionalize this. He said, "A Muslim woman in a shower heard a voice in
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.800]   her head, 'I have redeemed you.'" She didn't have a clue what that meant as a Muslim.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   She went to her imam, and he said, "Well, that was probably the Prophet Jesus. Only
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.760]   the Prophet Jesus talks that way." Well, meanwhile, up in Europe--I think it was
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.320]   Amsterdam--her sister is approached by a woman who says she had a strong sense, or
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.200]   I think it was a dream, in which she was supposed to get on a plane and fly to
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.400]   see her sister down in this Muslim country, and she had already bought her ticket for
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.440]   her. She flies down there, knocks on the door, and she's a Christian, and she says,
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.760]   "I don't know why I'm here," and the woman says, "Well, I know why you're here," and she shares
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.280]   Christ with her, she becomes a Christian, and that woman who had that impression in
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.680]   the shower is now in Max Stiles' church there in Dubai. So now that's the sort of
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.200]   thing that God's doing all over the world in terms of extraordinary works of
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.880]   the Spirit. So both the extraordinary and the ordinary show us that
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.280]   there's a way to pursue ministry that is different from what we ordinarily
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.040]   think is professional. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this
