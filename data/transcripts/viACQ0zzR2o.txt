[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   I think a lot of people aren't aware of just how striking
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.580]   in effect these certain behaviors that you want to avoid
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.620]   can have in diminishing your fertility
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.000]   for both males and females.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.840]   So let's talk about those.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.440]   So the first one is smoking.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.840]   And when we talk about smoking here,
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.560]   we're talking about smoking nicotine
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.440]   and we're talking about smoking cannabis.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.120]   And indeed there are strong data,
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.240]   and I will put a reference to one of the better,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.120]   larger analyses of these data.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.320]   There are strong data showing
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.680]   that cannabis reduces fertility.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.240]   Now I can already hear the screams from the back,
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.160]   although they're probably fairly drawled out screams
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.600]   from the back of people saying they smoke cannabis
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.800]   and they had no trouble conceiving.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.200]   Certainly there will be exceptions,
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.160]   but whether or not you're male or female,
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.900]   smoking cannabis is a bad idea
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.680]   if you want to conceive a healthy child.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.080]   Can you still conceive a healthy child
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.440]   while smoking cannabis?
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.080]   Probably certain people can.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.680]   Many people will greatly decrease the probability
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.180]   of a healthy fertilization in pregnancy
[00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.020]   by smoking cannabis.
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.760]   There are excellent data to support that.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.040]   As well, nicotine, both smoked or vaped,
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.920]   is going to disrupt the process of fertilization
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.440]   and can disrupt pregnancy dramatically, okay?
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.840]   So just avoid it altogether.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.680]   How does this happen?
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.620]   Well, it turns out that smoking increases
[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.360]   what are called reactive oxygen species.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.480]   This greatly disrupts the quality of the egg
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.120]   at the level of the spindle and mitochondria
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.760]   and a number of other features.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.300]   And in the sperm, turns out that smoking
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.700]   doesn't necessarily disrupt the sperm directly,
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.540]   although it can cause DNA fragmentation,
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.640]   which can cause all sorts of abnormalities,
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.980]   can prevent fertilization,
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.880]   can lead to birth defects in the offspring.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.760]   But more importantly,
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.120]   it increases what are called reactive oxygen species
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.800]   in the seminal fluid, in the semen that contain the sperm.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.700]   This very, under normal circumstances,
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.000]   under healthy circumstances,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   beautifully orchestrated chemistry of fluid
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.920]   that allows the sperm to thrive in their trajectory
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.640]   and attempt to fertilize the egg
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.040]   and lead to a healthy pregnancy.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.580]   So if you are a smoker and you want to conceive,
[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.580]   the best advice I can give you is to quit smoking.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.340]   And yes, that includes cannabis as well.
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.960]   Now, I am not somebody who believes
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.820]   that cannabis across the board is not useful.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.960]   There are medical applications and other applications.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.580]   I talk about that in an episode
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.080]   all about cannabis for health and disease.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.600]   And notice health was in there too.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.440]   So you cannabis smokers, don't come after me with,
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.760]   I guess, whatever it is, with bongs and pipes
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.920]   or whatever it is that you want, or with vapes.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.960]   The point is that while it can be beneficial
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.360]   for certain populations, it's certainly bad for others.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.280]   And if you're trying to conceive,
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.760]   it is bad for fertility and for a healthy pregnancy, okay?
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.520]   Now, that's smoking and vaping, by the way, okay?
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.200]   Vaping is included there.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.240]   Now, the next category of don'ts relates to alcohol.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.840]   Now, everyone has heard that drinking
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.920]   during pregnancy is a bad idea.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.560]   You may have heard, and some people have talked
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.640]   about the fact that there are cultures
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.640]   in which they allow, if you will, or even condone, sadly,
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.880]   one or two drinks while pregnant,
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.560]   provided it's just champagne or something of that sort.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.120]   That is a terrible idea.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.320]   I did an episode all about alcohol,
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.440]   both its potential health effects,
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.360]   of which there turned out to be zero.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.300]   And yes, that includes red wine.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.320]   It is far better to not drink at all.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.280]   And if you're going to drink,
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.880]   the limit, if you're a healthy adult
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.560]   who's not trying to conceive, not pregnant,
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.640]   and you don't have issues with alcoholism,
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.680]   is probably two drinks per week total.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.880]   That's right, two drinks per week total.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.080]   And that's the level that you really should consider
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.920]   if you're a drinker,
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.620]   if you're somebody who's trying to conceive.
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.240]   However, for a woman who becomes pregnant,
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.360]   the total number of drinks
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.640]   that you should allow yourself per week while pregnant
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.620]   and breastfeeding is indeed zero.
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.520]   There is absolutely no evidence
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.940]   that one can "get away" with drinking during pregnancy.
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.600]   And people say, "Well, I had a perfectly healthy child."
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.680]   But of course, you don't know
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.400]   what the health of that child would have been
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.360]   had you not drank at all.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.700]   Now, I'm not here with any generally strong stance
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.560]   against alcohol.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.960]   I myself am somebody who has a drink every once in a while,
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.640]   although I don't consider myself somebody
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.480]   who has a strong proclivity for alcohol.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.440]   And of course, at this moment,
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.140]   I'm not trying to conceive children,
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.660]   and I'm certainly not pregnant.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.640]   So that's safe for me.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.440]   But frankly, I haven't had a drink in a very long time.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.280]   And so I don't miss it, and that's me.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.560]   But I do realize that a lot of people enjoy alcohol.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.680]   And so it's that two drinks per week limit
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.240]   that really sets the upper limit and threshold
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.980]   beyond which you start running into issues
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.040]   with cellular mutation.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.520]   You start running into issues of oxidative stress,
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.200]   greatly increased cancer risk,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.600]   in particular, breast cancer risk.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.680]   All of that's covered in the alcohol episode that we did.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.200]   You can find it hubermanlab.com and timestamped
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.480]   if you want to navigate to specific topics and so forth,
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.760]   find out all about the data supporting the statements
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.840]   that I'm making, so on and so forth.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.080]   Now, if you're somebody who's seeking to conceive
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.560]   or you fall into this category
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.600]   that some couples describe themselves as we're not trying,
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.880]   but we're not not trying,
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.280]   meaning they're not using birth control,
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.700]   they're kind of letting chance run its course.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.040]   Well, then you should definitely be aware of the data
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.160]   showing that even just one bout,
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.680]   one bout of so-called binge drinking,
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.200]   which is five to six drinks in a given night
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   or half day in a 12-hour period,
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.920]   one bout of five to six drinks,
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.160]   if you're a woman or you're a man,
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.160]   greatly increases both the likelihood of mutations
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.760]   in the embryo that would result from a fertilization.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.920]   And at the same time, for reasons that should be obvious
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.080]   to you based on all the biology we've talked about,
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.800]   a greatly reduced probability of fertilization.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.560]   Now, that absolutely does not mean that you should use
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.100]   the ingestion of five or six drinks
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.280]   as a method of birth control.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.640]   That is not what I'm saying here.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.280]   What I'm saying is that if you go out on a given night
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.920]   and you have five or six drinks
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.380]   and you happen to become pregnant,
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.040]   the probability that that pregnancy will be disrupted
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.480]   in some way is greatly increased.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.880]   What the exact consequences are, no one can tell you.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.680]   But also if you're somebody who is interested
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.080]   in conceiving a child, well, then you absolutely
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.760]   should abstain from ingesting drinks more than one or two
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.720]   during the time in which you're trying to conceive.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.560]   And ideally it would be zero.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.440]   And you certainly would want to avoid
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.400]   drinking multiple drinks per night.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.760]   And so this idea of going out and having, you know,
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.600]   three or four drinks or four or five drinks in a given night
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.200]   at a time in which you're also trying to conceive children,
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.740]   the biology tells us, the epidemiology tells us
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.400]   that this is just a terrible idea.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.980]   It's going to reduce the likelihood of fertility
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.480]   and successful pregnancy.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.520]   And if there is a successful pregnancy,
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.120]   the word success needs to be in quotes, right?
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.960]   I mean, I think every parent, every species for that matter,
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.200]   wants to increase the probability
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.160]   of having healthy offspring.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.200]   And so to my mind anyway,
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.440]   and to the OBGYNs and the urologists
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.720]   that are focused on fertility that I spoke to,
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.480]   everyone will say, try as hard as you can
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.400]   to avoid the so-called binge drinking episodes.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.880]   And again, these episodes are one night
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.480]   of consuming five to six drinks.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.800]   Now, another important thing to remember in this context
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.760]   is that the negative effects of consuming five or six drinks
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.960]   in a given night extend over many weeks
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.600]   following the ingestion of that alcohol.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.320]   If you're a male,
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.360]   what that means is that's going to impact
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.680]   the quality of your sperm
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.720]   and greatly decrease the likelihood of successful
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.520]   fertilization and/or healthy pregnancy
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.920]   over the period of that entire spermatogenesis window,
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.820]   which is, as we talked about before, 60 to 90 days, right?
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.000]   60 to generate the sperm,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.400]   and then in some additional time for the sperm
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.420]   to be transported to the point
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.020]   where they could be ejaculated.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.960]   If you're a woman and you have five or six drinks
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.800]   on a given night,
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.560]   well, then you are going to disrupt the quality,
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.720]   not of just the egg that eventually ovulates,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.900]   but indeed the entire pool of follicles
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.040]   that leaves the ovarian vault and reserve,
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.480]   and from which the one egg will be selected.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.040]   In other words, you are reducing the quality
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.160]   of all of the eggs that you happen to deploy that month.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.720]   Now, some of you who were really
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.520]   following the biology earlier might say,
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.000]   well, what if I have those five or six drinks
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.120]   during the time in which I'm menstruating,
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.600]   in which there's bleeding present,
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.340]   and therefore I haven't yet ovulated?
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.060]   Ah, but if you remember the biology
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.220]   we talked about earlier specifically,
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.000]   there is a subset of follicles and eggs
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.720]   that leave that ovarian reserve
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.240]   quite a bit before that one egg is selected for
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.500]   and ovulates, and of course,
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.440]   there are all the different hormonal cascades
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.320]   in the general milieu of the ovary,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.320]   which are important and are being regulated
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.280]   by different hormones, and yes, indeed,
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.680]   the regulation of those hormones
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.840]   is strongly impacted by alcohol
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.120]   through a number of different pathways,
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.440]   through the regulation of the neurotransmitter GABA
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.600]   up in the brain, right?
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.560]   It's actually a lot of GABA and GABA receptors
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.000]   in the hypothalamus, the very region
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.160]   from which gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.640]   our old friend from a couple hours ago in this discussion,
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.920]   going to disrupt GnRH secretion.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.880]   You can disrupt pituitary function with alcohol.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.040]   Again and again, what we're seeing is that consuming
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.360]   more than one or two drinks per week of alcohol
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.440]   is really detrimental to the entire process of fertility
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.160]   and the entire process of healthy pregnancy,
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.880]   and that's true from both the male side and the sperm,
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.480]   and it's true from the female side and the egg.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.420]   So my simple advice on this is if you are wishing
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.760]   to have a healthy fertilization and pregnancy,
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.960]   the best thing to do would be avoid alcohol together,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.920]   and if you're going to drink,
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.360]   to really limit that drinking
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.720]   to one or two drinks per week maximum.
