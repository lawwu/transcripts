[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about the
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.160]   ideal number of banking relationships to feel safe and secure, but also to get the best
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.160]   terms.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.800]   The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, as well as the almost collapse of First
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.920]   Republic Bank, they're getting a $30 billion deposit injection by some large institutions
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.000]   right now, and also the almost collapse of Credit Suisse Bank, a firm which I used to
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.400]   work for.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.000]   It's prudent, it's wise for all of us to review our existing banking relationships and see
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.120]   if we are well positioned to weather another potential bank run.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.120]   This situation with the banks can go on and on and on because I would say a majority of
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.640]   the banks have some losses, some mark to market losses in their bond portfolio because rates
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.640]   went up.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.320]   If they hold to maturity, they're going to be fine.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.880]   However, in the meantime, they're going to be loss making because their deposit costs
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.600]   have gone so far up.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.760]   So if banks are forced to sell because depositors are pulling assets, they're going to have
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.040]   a problem.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.160]   So in my opinion, the ideal number of banking relationships to have is three.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.720]   One for operations, two for borrowing, three for investing.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.280]   Now obviously when you first start out, one bank is probably good enough.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.600]   You're going to receive your direct deposits to that bank, you're going to write checks,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.120]   all that good stuff.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.940]   But as you grow wealthier and your finances get more complicated, you want to continuously
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.620]   shop around for the best terms out there.
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.420]   So that main bank that you're banking with might not have the best borrowing rates if
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.140]   you want to get a personal loan or a mortgage.
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.920]   And that bank might not offer the best investing platform or the lowest fees or no fees.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.720]   So you should shop around as well.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.780]   It's the same idea as shopping around for an insurance quote, whether it's homeowners
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.120]   insurance or life insurance.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.580]   About every two years you should probably shop around because you'll be surprised at
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.360]   how much you can save by just looking at other vendors.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.300]   For example, my wife thought she had the best life insurance term policy with USAA for six
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.140]   years until she started shopping around.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.140]   Why?
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.280]   Because I decided to shop around because my 10-year term life insurance policy was coming
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.820]   to an end and I needed something new.
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.220]   And once I started shopping around, I said, "Hey, check out what Policy Genius can offer
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.220]   you."
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.780]   And so she checked around and she was able to get a better life insurance policy for
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.340]   20-30% cheaper.
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.540]   And she renewed another 20-year term lease and that was pretty good.
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.540]   So shop around.
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.400]   At any given moment in time, financial institutions are looking to drum up business for their
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.300]   mortgage business or to gain more deposits.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.420]   It's very fluid because money comes and goes all the time and banks, to stay competitive
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.580]   or to try to attract new capital, have to offer higher rates or lower fees or better
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.020]   terms.
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.660]   And if you're just starting out on your financial independence journey or you don't have that
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.140]   much money, you're not going to get the best rates.
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.180]   You're not going to get the best CD rates, money market rates.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.820]   You're not going to get the lowest mortgage rates.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.100]   So you need to shop around.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.300]   And at the same time, it's not practical to have 7, 8, 10 banking relationships unless
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.120]   you are a centimillionaire or billionaire because it's hard to keep track of everything
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.960]   and you've got to file all these tax forms.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:54.060]   The reality is, if you bank with one FDI insured bank, you're probably going to be fine if
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.200]   you have under $250,000 in assets.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.940]   Now the FDIC insurance is $250,000 per ownership account.
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:10.340]   So if you have a partner, there's a joint account, you got $500,000 in FDIC insurance
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.060]   for your cash or CD.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:21.100]   So if you have three banking relationships, then you have at least $750,000 in FDIC insurance.
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.180]   Do you really need that much?
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.180]   Probably not.
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.580]   For most Americans, individuals or households, we don't have $750,000 in money market savings
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.580]   or CDs.
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.460]   I would say less than 5%, maybe less than 2% of Americans have that much sitting around.
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.720]   In addition to FDIC insurance, $250,000 per ownership, there's the SIPC, which protects
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.360]   against the loss of cash and securities such as stocks and bonds held by a customer at
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.860]   a financially troubled SIPC member brokerage firm.
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.980]   And basically all the big brokerage firms, Fidelity, Vanguard, Charles Schwab, they are
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.900]   all SIPC member brokerage firms.
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.380]   So you don't have to worry too much.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.820]   Well, you do have to worry if you have millions and millions and billions of dollars in securities.
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.460]   You know, like let's say what happened with Bernie Madoff and you had $10 million with
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.460]   him.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.980]   You might not see that money back if there is fraud.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:26.580]   But it's proven that most people get most if not all of their money back due to fraud.
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.100]   Now finally, there's also this thing called a sweep program.
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.220]   Now the sweep program is to help customers.
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.820]   It's a brokerage or a bank account that at the close of each business day automatically
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.700]   transfers funds that surpass or fall short of a certain threshold into a higher interest
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.660]   earning investment option.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.820]   And that's usually a money market fund.
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.140]   Maybe it's not automatic for some, but for most brokerage accounts and banks, it is automatic.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.740]   And there's also the sweep program participants where the number of financial institution
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.100]   participants helps you gain more FDIC insurance on your cash.
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:12.020]   So when you look online and you see some brokerages say, well, we have $1 million in FDIC guarantee
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.820]   for you, it's because they have four banking institutions that are part of their sweep
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.300]   program that are offering FDIC insurance.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.780]   Little complicated, but not really.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.660]   It's a evolution of the financial institutional system to protect its customers better.
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.060]   Now back to the ideal number of banking relationships.
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.200]   I say three, I actually have four because I have a relationship with another bank for
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.340]   my business because I want to keep my business and personal separate.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.820]   And the reality is keeping track of all these accounts is a little cumbersome.
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.300]   Four for me is the max.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.500]   I don't know about you.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:56.980]   I did a poll in my post and it looks like about 35% of y'all have four or five banking
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.980]   institutions.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:07.260]   23% have three, 14% have six to eight, 12% have two, only 5% of y'all have one, 2% of
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.040]   you have 10 plus and 1% of you have nine to 10.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.440]   So 42% of you have four to five.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.800]   That sounds about right.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.220]   So which three would you choose?
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.100]   Well, it's based on the terms really.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.820]   For me, it's terms first.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:28.420]   Can you get me the highest savings rate, the highest CD rate, or the lowest mortgage rate?
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.140]   If so, I'm probably going to bank with you, especially if you have a good user interface
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.080]   and a nice person to talk to.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.420]   But let's look at the top banks by total assets.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:44.440]   At number one is JP Morgan Chase with about 3.2 trillion.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.740]   Number two is Bank of America with 2.41 trillion.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.580]   Number three is Citigroup with 1.77 trillion.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:57.940]   And number four is Wells Fargo with about 1.72 trillion as of 2023.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.700]   These are the top four banks.
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.140]   They are designated as the quote too big to fail banks.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.500]   They cannot fail because if one of them fails, there's going to be contagion and systemic
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.340]   risk across the entire economy and it'll be really bad for us.
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:18.740]   So the government basically has implicitly decided to make sure none of these banks fail.
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:24.380]   Now, if you look at banks five to 10, their total assets drop off tremendously.
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.780]   At number five is US Bancorp at only 585 billion.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.780]   PNC Financial Services, 552 billion.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.460]   Chuist Bank, 546 billion.
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.580]   Goldman Sachs at 486 billion.
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.720]   Number nine, Capital One at 453 billion.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.580]   And number 10, TD Group US Holdings, 386 billion.
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.580]   I doubt these banks will fail either.
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.420]   But if you're going to go with a bigger bank, you might as well at least have one or two
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:59.460]   of your three banks as one of the biggest banks if you want to sleep well at night.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.900]   Well, what about a regional bank like First Republic Bank and Silicon Valley Bank?
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:11.060]   Well, clearly, these banks are being targeted for withdrawals, which is why their share
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.420]   prices are getting crushed.
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:20.500]   But if you have less than $250,000 with each bank, or if you have a huge loan with these
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.900]   banks, you shouldn't really be worried.
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:28.100]   A lot of people go with regional banks due to the relationships.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:33.380]   You have people who you can call or who will text you back or respond to you over email
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.420]   within 30 minutes, an hour.
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:40.460]   You know, this type of service is really valuable to some people, especially to higher net worth
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.740]   individuals.
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:48.540]   However, if you have mega millions, well, you probably need to diversify away from regional
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.540]   banks.
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.540]   You can have your account there, but I wouldn't make it the main banking account.
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:59.420]   I would certainly try to balance out how many assets you have with each of your banking
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.820]   relationships.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:07.340]   Don't have one bank with 80, 90% of the assets and the other two banks with 10%, 10%.
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:12.460]   I would think, I think it's smart to go, you know, 33%, 33%, 33%.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.020]   Obviously, you're never going to get it exactly right.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.660]   But to spread that risk around.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:23.620]   Another strategy worth deploying is to borrow more heavily from a regional bank, a smaller
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:29.020]   bank that might be more at risk, but who is giving you much better terms, much lower mortgage
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:34.780]   rates, borrowing rates, and then invest with the larger banks and have more of your capital,
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.260]   your cash with the largest too big to fail banks.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:44.540]   Every single banker wants as many accounts open with you as possible.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.900]   The more accounts they have, the better they get paid, the more they can make money.
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:54.860]   As you develop more wealth, accumulate more wealth with one bank, your terms will get
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.020]   better.
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.540]   Their customer service is going to get better.
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.060]   They're going to be more responsive to your needs.
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.540]   And that's a great thing.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:06.880]   However, you have to be aware of the insurance levels and the solvency of the bank.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.340]   If you stick with the top banks, you're probably never going to encounter a problem.
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:17.320]   So one strategy you should think about as you get wealthier is to concentrate your assets
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.460]   in one finance institution so you can get the best service.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.420]   You have to understand what that tier service entails.
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:31.380]   So there might be three tiers at a bank where if you have 250,000, you're at tier three,
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:38.300]   500,000 to 1 million, you're at tier two, and then at 1 million or greater in assets
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.460]   or in borrowing, you're at tier one and you get the best terms.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:50.620]   So if three banks is the ideal number of banking relationships to have, and 1 million is generally
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.660]   the threshold to get the best terms, tier one terms, then your goal should be to have
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.980]   about 3 million or more spread across three banks equally.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.640]   Actually, it doesn't have to be 3 million in assets.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:09.580]   It could be a $1 million plus mortgage at a regional bank or smaller bank that has the
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:16.580]   best terms for borrowing costs, and then you can spread out 1 million to a large bank and
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.740]   another million to another large bank with good user interface, no trading commissions,
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:26.540]   and a great plethora of research and available securities to purchase.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:32.420]   Now let's say you are very wealthy, very fortunate, and you have over 10 million investable assets,
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.660]   50 million, 100 million, a billion.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.940]   What is the right strategy?
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:42.700]   Well, you can still stick with three banks or maybe four banks, but instead of just holding
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.900]   your money in cash, you should buy US Treasury bonds.
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:54.660]   US Treasury bonds or bills are very liquid, and they yield greater amounts than your money
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.880]   market funds.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:02.400]   So you can buy an unlimited amount of US Treasury bonds, and therefore the US Treasury Department
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.720]   is your banker.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.780]   And the US Treasury Department isn't going to go bankrupt because it is the system.
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.860]   It is the guarantor of last resorts.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.620]   It is the one who can print unlimited amount of funds.
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.780]   So that's what you should do.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.560]   Oh, and it's funny.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.060]   After I had finished playing tennis, a billionaire was up next.
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:28.920]   I've known him for over a decade, and he's probably worth $2.5 to $3 billion.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.620]   Very successful investor.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.460]   You might have seen him run for president one day.
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.820]   Anyway, so I asked him, "What do you do with your cash in light of the situation?"
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.140]   And he said, "Well, it's obvious.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.780]   I own assets.
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.540]   My assets that can't be taken away.
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.460]   And also, I own a lot of Treasury bonds."
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.460]   So there you have it.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:56.620]   Someone who has way more than 99.9999% of us owns assets, real assets, and buys Treasury
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.620]   bonds.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:02.740]   Now, let's just go back to the majority of people who don't have that type of money.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.860]   And let's say you just have $50,000 to $100,000.
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.020]   Should you still have three banking relationships?
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.420]   Well, you should obviously still have one.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.740]   You should have a minimum of two, I think, for optimization purposes.
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.060]   If you want to get a loan, if you want to get the higher rates.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:23.560]   Two, because when you have two, you have competing bankers or banks who want your assets.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.080]   So when you have competition, well, people are going to offer you better terms.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:34.480]   So if your assets are well under $250,000, I say have at least two banking relationships.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:40.180]   You never know when one bank might stop giving you that line of credit or cut off that personal
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.180]   loan.
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.460]   And it's nice to have more access to more branches and more ATMs as well.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.100]   All right, folks, let's all hang in there.
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:51.900]   It seems like all the governments around the world, all the regulators are on the same
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.940]   page and they don't want any bank to fail.
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.940]   The silver lining from all these bank runs is that the Federal Reserve might be a little
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:06.880]   softer when it comes time to hike again or a little quicker when it comes time to pause
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.100]   or to cut.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:14.620]   Although the ECB did raise rates surprisingly on the morning of March 16th by 50 basis points
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.700]   saying inflation is still too high.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.760]   We got to get that under control.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:24.660]   So I expect the Federal Reserve to hike one more time, another 25 basis points, get to
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.080]   5% on the Fed funds rate, and that's it.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:34.140]   The more important point is going to be the language that Jerome Powell tells the world.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.540]   He needs to sound confident, calm and aware.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:43.060]   If he can do those three things, I think the market is going to like that, which also means
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:50.000]   I don't think we're going to get back to the recent lows of $3,597 on the S&P 500.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.860]   If we get below $3,800, I'm going to be buying again.
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.140]   Probably going to be nibbling again.
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:00.640]   I'm still filling out my kids 529 plans respectively.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.400]   I'm about 60% of the way there for this year for each.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.820]   So just bit by bit, dollar cost averaging a little by little.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:15.440]   I'm still happy with my treasury bonds yielding 5% as we wait for the storm to end.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:22.020]   And there is a scenario by mid this year, mid 2023, we could feel a lot of reprieve
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:27.580]   because we know the Fed hike cycle, the rate hike cycle has ended.
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:32.040]   And there's only upside in terms of downside with the Fed funds rate.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:38.220]   And given the stock market looks six to 12 months ahead, we do have hope.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.100]   So I would say keep the hope alive.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.660]   And if you're looking to buy real estate over the next three to six months, I think is a
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.620]   really opportune time.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.780]   The focus really is going to return to real assets that hold their value better, that
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.660]   are less volatile, that produce income and that provide utility.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.540]   Thanks so much, everyone.
