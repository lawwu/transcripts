[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   Welcome back to a new week on the podcast.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.320]   Michelle is up next with her question.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.520]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.360]   I'm a 25 year old avid listener of the podcast from New Zealand.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.680]   I work at a university and often have conversations with the academics and
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.440]   university staff alike who are all mostly older than I am.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.360]   By God's grace, I would sometimes have the boldness and courage to speak with them
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.520]   about Christ and challenge their unbelief.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.700]   The normal accusation against God that they would pose to me would go something
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.120]   like this, God owes us because he made us.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.420]   To elaborate, they would say things like, if I can be a good father to my child
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.560]   and forgive him when he rebels against me, then why can't God do that for all of us?
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.720]   He made us after all, or God must bless us because he made us.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.600]   And why all the mystery?
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.640]   God owes us the explanation to all this because he made us and put
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.800]   us in this place to begin with.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.760]   Now, I believe that God doesn't owe us anything, but in fact, we owe him everything.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.800]   However, can you please help me explain this better to my non-believing colleagues?
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:18.520]   Let me try to answer Michelle in three different kinds of steps.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.480]   First, for her own encouragement and stability, it would be good perhaps
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.400]   to remember the words of Jesus.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.600]   I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.880]   things from the wise and understanding and reveal them to little children.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.640]   In other words, Jesus tells us not to be surprised that high level academics will
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.120]   be among the most blind people in the world.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.480]   The apostle Paul warned about the very same thing when he said,
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.360]   "Where is the one who is wise?
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.760]   Where's the scribe?
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.760]   Where's the debater of this age?
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.440]   Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?"
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:12.440]   And he gives, Paul gives the reason why God reveals these things to those without
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.880]   any worldly credentials like this, "So that no human being might boast in the
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.840]   presence of God, let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.440]   In other words, the underlying problem is pride and self-exaltation and a deep
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.480]   desire not to find our significance and satisfaction in God's
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.400]   greatness, but rather in our own.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.240]   So that's the first thing I would say to Michelle.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.040]   I don't think that should cause us to give up on proud academic types any more
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.080]   than we want anybody to give up on us.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.200]   So the second thing to say is that Paul did give an answer to the question of why
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.480]   God doesn't owe us, but rather we owe God.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.400]   And he says it in two ways.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.920]   He says it in Romans 11.34 like this, "Who has known the mind of the Lord or who has
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.680]   been his counselor?"
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.040]   In other words, give him counsel.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.960]   "Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid for from him and through
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.120]   him and to him are all things to him be glory forever and ever.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.720]   Amen."
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.200]   In other words, none of us could ever give counsel to God since he knows everything
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.840]   and all our knowledge is dependent on his.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.480]   And so we can never put him in our debt by offering him any counsel that he doesn't
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.760]   already know as though he would then need to pay us back.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.080]   In fact, Paul says we've never given him anything.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.960]   We've never given God anything that would put him in our debt because everything is
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.160]   his already.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.840]   Instead, he says in verse 36, "From him, through him, to him are all things to him
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.240]   be glory forever and ever.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.640]   Amen."
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.080]   In other words, since all things come from God and are sustained through God, they
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.720]   exist to call attention to his glory, not our glory.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.600]   That's the root issue of proud people.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.640]   They don't like everything existing for God's glory.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.200]   They want some ground of boasting in themselves.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.160]   That's the first way Paul says it in Romans 11.34.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.320]   Here's the second way he says it in Romans 9.20.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.440]   He says that God is like a potter and we're like pots.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.600]   And then he says, "Who are you, O man, to answer back to God?
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:46.000]   Will what is molded say to its molder, the pot, to the potter, 'Why have you made me
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.760]   like this?
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.520]   Has the potter no right over the clay?'"
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.840]   Now, right there's the key issue.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.120]   "Has the potter no right over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel for
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.480]   honor, honorable use, and another for dishonorable use?"
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.040]   In other words, creation has no right to tell the creator how he should have done his
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.280]   work or how he should run his work.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.000]   So I think Michelle should make that point, which she does, I think, and then let it
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.560]   stand.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:27.480]   If people reverse it and say that the creature has natural rights to dictate to the
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.880]   creator, well, that mistake is going to be exposed sooner or later.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.760]   But here's the last thing, the third thing that I think might, just might, open a
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.240]   window, a door with the people that Michelle is working with.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:51.160]   Jesus told a parable, Matthew 18, 21 to 35, about a servant who owed the king a
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.280]   million dollars, actually millions of millions, just off the chart, zillions of
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.880]   dollars.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.560]   The king canceled the debt for this servant.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:10.400]   And when the servant went out, he showed that his mindset had not been humbled to
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.280]   the point where he believed he really was a debtor to mercy.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.760]   Instead, he acted like he deserved to be forgiven.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:28.200]   So he choked, he choked his fellow servant who owed him $10 and tried to make him
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.840]   pay.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.160]   Now, I think that parable is very relevant to Michelle's question.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:41.480]   Doesn't it teach that when we have the mindset that thinks God owes us
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:49.760]   forgiveness, doesn't that mindset of "you owe me" naturally lead to an arrogant
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.120]   abuse of other people?
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.880]   Not just God, but other people.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.400]   And that's what might cause her colleagues to sit up and take note.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:05.880]   The mindset of being owed, "you owe me, God," is the essence of pride, and that
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.480]   leads to the destruction of others.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.440]   You can see it in history.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:18.920]   But the mindset of owing God everything, being a debtor to mercy, expecting nothing
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:26.240]   because of our merits, but only freely in mercy and deserving nothing good from God
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.360]   at all, that leads to a life of brokenhearted humility and service.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.640]   And Paul put it just that way.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:41.520]   He said, "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.520]   God in Christ forgave you."
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.160]   If you are treated better than you deserve, then you have the mindset to treat
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.760]   others better than they deserve.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:08:00.840]   So maybe that might give a breakthrough to Michelle's friends and help them see
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:08.360]   that it is a good and beautiful thing to humble ourselves as debtors to mercy
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.360]   rather than demanding of others, including God, that they owe us.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:14.600]   Amen.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.120]   That's wise.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.880]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.040]   On Wednesday, we're going to return with a question about how to cultivate
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.920]   deep thinking in a culture that makes it too easy to slip into passive superficiality.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.640]   We all feel this tug.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.960]   So how do we break free from the current?
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.720]   We'll ask John Piper next time.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.880]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
