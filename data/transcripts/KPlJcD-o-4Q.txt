[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.080]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.880]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.320]   Today, we are discussing creativity.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.280]   Creativity is a topic that to many people is very abstract.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.760]   That is, we know when something seems creative,
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.680]   some of us know people who are creative
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.600]   or perhaps are creative,
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.680]   and yet the ability to be creative resides in everybody.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.720]   And we know that because the neural circuits
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.300]   that underlie creativity have been somewhat defined,
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.840]   and the steps and processes within the brain and body
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.720]   that lead to creativity are well-known.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.320]   That said, most people don't know how to access creativity.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.800]   And if they do know how to access creativity,
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.560]   they are only able to access creativity
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.060]   in a fairly limited number of domains of life.
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.600]   For instance, in the visual arts or in music
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.920]   or within science or engineering
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.600]   or any number of different domains
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.600]   ranging from the kitchen to sport to childhood interactions,
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.160]   that is, childhood games.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.280]   In other words, some adults are able to access
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.040]   their creative spirit when engaging in childlike play
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.360]   with children or, for that matter, with adults.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.920]   But as it turns out, all of creativity
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.560]   stems from just a small subset of neural structures
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.800]   in the brain that need to be activated
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.720]   in a particular sequence or order.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.280]   Today, we will talk about what those neural structures are,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.880]   what particular order they need to be activated in
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.780]   in order to come up with, for instance,
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.780]   new ideas that are creative,
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.280]   and then how to implement those creative strategies.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.360]   We will also talk about different ways to access creativity
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.240]   that include narrative and storytelling,
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.200]   as well as applying new rule sets
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.120]   or even entirely new worldviews.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.320]   And we will do this in a structured way
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.800]   that will allow anyone,
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.200]   whether or not you consider yourself creative or not,
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.600]   to be able to apply these tools
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.960]   in different domains of life,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.780]   work, family, play, and on and on.
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.020]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.880]   you will have a better understanding of what creativity is
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.060]   and how to access it and, if you like,
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.720]   to bring others into your creative endeavors,
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.360]   which, as you'll soon learn,
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.880]   can massively expand the extent to which you yourself
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.760]   can express your creative talents.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.480]   As is the case with all episodes
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.080]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.600]   today we will discuss both scientific mechanisms
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.520]   and nomenclature,
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.440]   and I promise to make all of that clear to you,
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.740]   even if you don't have a background in biology or psychology,
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.000]   but we will also, of course, discuss tools,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.880]   that is, specific steps that you can take
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.520]   in order to be more creative.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.920]   One particular tool that I'm excited to share with you
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.760]   involves a meditation,
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.760]   but this is a very unusual meditation.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.360]   This is not sitting with eyes closed,
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.560]   focusing on your breath or focusing on a chime
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.700]   or some other feature in your sensory environment
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.100]   or even in your body.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.800]   Later, we will talk about open monitoring meditations.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.300]   Open monitoring meditations are very distinct
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.940]   from other forms of meditation
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.680]   and involve learning how to sit back
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.180]   and simply observe your thoughts
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.680]   while intentionally varying where your thoughts go.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.240]   So for those of you that find it a struggle
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.200]   to focus or to refocus
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.940]   in more traditional forms of meditation,
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.700]   or maybe even in your work,
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.360]   and even for those of you that may suffer
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.700]   from things like ADHD or similar,
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.160]   open monitoring meditation can be an extremely valuable tool
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.120]   for accessing your creative abilities
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.460]   because of the ways that it allows you
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.360]   to tap into specific circuits
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.040]   within the frontal networks of your brain.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.540]   So these are networks of the brain
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.600]   that include the areas just behind your forehead,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.620]   and that allow you to evaluate new and novel rule sets
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.960]   in a very unconstrained way.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.960]   Because if you think about it,
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.720]   creativity is really the ability
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.720]   to take existing elements from the physical world
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.140]   or from the thought world, if you will,
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.800]   or from any domain of life, mood, thinking, and information,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.760]   and to reorder those into novel combinations
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.640]   that are useful for something.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.200]   And as we'll also find out later,
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.800]   creativity has this incredible aspect to it,
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.760]   which is that when we see or create
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.240]   or experience something that is truly creative,
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.620]   it reveals to us something fundamental
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.500]   about the way that the natural world,
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.000]   and indeed the way that our brains work.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.240]   If that sounds very mysterious and abstract to you now,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.580]   I promise that by the end of today's episode,
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.560]   you will not only understand what that means,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.800]   but you will also understand
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.960]   how to use open monitoring meditations
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.400]   as well as other forms of tools
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.460]   in order to access your creative ability.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.220]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.580]   that this podcast is separate
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.720]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.760]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.640]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.680]   about science and science-related tools
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.960]   to the general public.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.000]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.680]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.500]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.560]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.480]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.600]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.200]   from Stanford, and everything about Roca eyeglasses
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.160]   and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.940]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.780]   of the visual system,
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.360]   and I can tell you that your visual system
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.840]   has to contend with an enormous number of challenges
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.120]   for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.180]   For instance, when you move from a shady area
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.520]   to a sunny area, there are all sorts of adaptations
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.560]   that have to occur in your eye and brain.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.880]   Roca understands these kinds of adaptations,
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.840]   and the other one's required to see clearly,
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.520]   and those are built into the engineering
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.320]   of their sunglasses and eyeglasses.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.080]   One of the things that makes Roca eyeglasses
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.780]   and sunglasses so terrific
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.440]   is that they are extremely lightweight.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.340]   In fact, most of the time,
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.000]   I don't even realize that they're on my face.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.560]   I wear sunglasses when I drive
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.000]   and whenever I need to throughout the day,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.840]   and I wear readers at night.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.100]   I do not wear sunglasses when I get my morning sunlight,
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.560]   which I do every single morning,
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.520]   as you should be doing also,
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.720]   as is covered many times on this podcast.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.900]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are also unique
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.300]   in that unlike a lot of so-called performance eyeglasses
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.720]   out there, they don't make you look like a cyborg.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.900]   They have some of the styles
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.120]   that make you look like a cyborg, if that's your thing,
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.780]   but if you want to wear glasses or sunglasses out to dinner
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.080]   or around for social reasons,
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.520]   they have many different aesthetic styles to choose from.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.720]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.280]   go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your order.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.640]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com,
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.700]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.260]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.360]   Thesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.900]   And as you may have heard me say before,
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.840]   I am not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.240]   because it means smart drugs.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.160]   And frankly, there is no neural circuit in the brain
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.120]   for being quote unquote smart.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.600]   There are neural circuits for focus.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.800]   There are neural circuits for task switching.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.240]   There are neural circuits for today's topic,
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.060]   which is creativity.
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.660]   Nootropics, therefore, is not a great word
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.040]   to describe any sort of supplement or drug
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.800]   that can enhance brain function
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.640]   because it lacks specificity.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.000]   Thesis understands this
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.360]   and therefore has designed custom nootropics
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.320]   that are tailored to your specific needs
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.120]   and that allow you to enter the brain and bodily states
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.940]   that are optimal for things like focus,
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.460]   energy, creativity, and so on.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.300]   If you'd like to try
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.960]   your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.840]   go online to takethesis.com/huberman,
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.200]   take their brief three-minute quiz,
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.160]   and Thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.420]   to try in your first month.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.880]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.620]   and use the code Huberman at checkout
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.680]   for 10% off your first box.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.940]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.300]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.860]   that contains everything you need,
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.620]   that is sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.040]   in the precise ratios that you need without sugar.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.340]   As I've talked about many times before
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.560]   in this podcast and elsewhere,
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.000]   every cell in your body requires hydration and electrolytes
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.440]   in order to function properly.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.360]   And a key example of this are the neurons,
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.440]   the nerve cells of your brain
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.280]   that allow you to think clearly, to exercise hard, et cetera.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.840]   Neurons require sodium
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.780]   in order to fire what are called action potentials
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.040]   or electrical signaling between neurons,
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.800]   and they require potassium and magnesium,
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.340]   and those have to be present in the correct ratios
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.840]   in order for your brain and body to function optimally.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.600]   Element is formulated to help anyone
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.840]   with their electrolyte needs
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.440]   and is perfectly suited to anyone following
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.380]   a ketogenic, low carbohydrate, or paleolithic diet,
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.740]   or a basic omnivore diet, which is the one that I follow.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.800]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.640]   you can go to Drink Element, that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.160]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.120]   And right now, Element has two special flavors
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.140]   for the holidays, chocolate caramel and mint chocolate,
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.360]   which I should mention taste especially good
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.880]   if you actually heat it up.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.760]   So if you treat it sort of like a tea, it works,
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.560]   or if you drink it cold, it's delicious.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.920]   All the flavors of Element I find delicious.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.720]   Again, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.620]   that's lmnt.com/huberman.
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.360]   The Huberman Lab podcast is now partnered
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.600]   with Momentus Supplements.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.920]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.140]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.760]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.120]   livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.720]   And I should just mention that the library
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.900]   of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.000]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.720]   Let's talk about creativity.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.440]   On the face of it, the word creativity and creative acts
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.240]   might seem somewhat abstract to us.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.620]   That is, we know when we see something
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.600]   that we consider creative,
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.840]   and we know when we see something that is not creative,
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.640]   things that aren't creative are things that we see every day.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.600]   A car with four tires, for instance,
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.320]   a bicycle with two tires, not creative.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.040]   However, we also see things that are novel,
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:18.980]   that are different,
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.880]   and that we don't really think of as creative.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.080]   In fact, they can be downright trivial.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.800]   For instance, if I were to take a fish tank
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.760]   and put wings on it,
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.160]   that's a novel combination of things,
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.160]   which is one of the key criteria for an act or an object
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.920]   or a piece of music that is creative.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.260]   And yet neither of us, I believe,
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.720]   would find it very creative or very interesting
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.080]   that a fish tank has wings on it.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.480]   Why or why not, I should say?
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.140]   Well, it turns out that for something to be creative,
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.040]   it actually has to reveal to us something fundamental
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.840]   about the world or about how we work.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.900]   And I must say that oftentimes the most creative
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.640]   and the most interesting and the most beloved creative acts
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.920]   reveal to us something fundamental about the world
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.080]   or the way that we work
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.240]   in a way that delights and thrills and surprises us,
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.220]   but that we aren't even aware what that fundamental rule is.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.680]   I'll return to this in a few minutes,
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.820]   but the time being,
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.020]   let's just build up from first principles,
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.640]   what constitutes something creative
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.240]   and what does not constitute something creative.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.000]   Creativity is a way of interacting with the world
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.480]   or combining or recombining things in the world
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.680]   in a way that appears novel to us and to other people.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.600]   My example of a fish tank with wings on it is novel,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.440]   but frankly, it's not very creative
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.960]   and it's not very interesting.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.820]   It doesn't reveal anything new to us.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.060]   Sure, they're flying fish,
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.000]   although they just kind of jump far, they don't really fly.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.040]   And as a consequence, putting wings on a fish tank
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.640]   could be used as a metaphor for the fact that fish don't fly
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.400]   but you already knew and I already knew that fish don't fly.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.260]   And so there's nothing novel revealed to us about the world
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.360]   except something we already knew.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.680]   Now, creative acts on the other hand,
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.820]   of course involve novel combinations of existing rule sets.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.080]   That could be different combinations of music or colors
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.260]   or shapes or technology, et cetera,
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:16.380]   but it does so in a way that tells us something fundamental
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.380]   and different.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.680]   Let me give an example of a few truly creative artistic acts
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.520]   and I'll do that in the domain of visual arts.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.000]   But of course, there are many examples that could come
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.160]   from music or from other domains, sport, et cetera.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.640]   Examples I'll give rather than a fish tank with wings
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.320]   are for instance, the comparison between a drawing
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.160]   or a very accurate painting of a face,
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.480]   an Escher painting and a Banksy.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.360]   Okay, if you don't know what those are, I'll explain.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.880]   First of all, let's talk about
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.300]   an accurate representation of a face.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.620]   If I were to sit you down
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.360]   or if you were to send me a photograph
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.560]   and then I were to paint or draw a picture of your face
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.160]   in a way that faithfully represented the position
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.140]   and shape of your nose relative to the eyes,
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:10.140]   maybe a curl of the lip, maybe a few hairs of your eyebrows
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.120]   in a particular way that really captured you accurately.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.920]   I think most people would say, okay, it's accurate.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.120]   It looks a lot like the photograph or the person.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.440]   And on the one hand, while that could be interesting,
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.920]   it's not particularly creative
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.720]   because it faithfully represents what's already there.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.240]   In contrast, a painting or a picture like an Escher,
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.860]   and for those of you that aren't familiar with Eschers,
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.440]   involves a lot of repeating patterns.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.240]   So for instance, a bird image
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.620]   that's repeated over and over and over and over again,
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.600]   sometimes in partially overlapping manner
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.880]   and perhaps a building that's repeated
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.000]   over and over and over again,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.800]   or stones repeated over and over again,
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.240]   or staircases over and over again.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.740]   Eschers capture elements from the outside world
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.340]   and faithfully represent them,
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.800]   but faithfully represent them over and over and over again,
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.000]   which is not typically seen in the natural world.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.860]   In fact, most of what our visual system does
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.920]   is to eliminate repetitive patterns when we see them.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.000]   In fact, most of what our visual system does
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.400]   is try and make us blind to repetitive patterns
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.480]   in our visual environment and only allow us to see things
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.380]   that are unusual in that visual environment.
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.400]   Now, this is especially true at visual scales.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.240]   What I mean by that is if you were to go to the beach
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.680]   and lie on your towel and look down at the sand,
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.120]   you would start to notice that the sand
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.120]   is a very, very repetitive pattern.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.600]   So at very small scales,
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.100]   and in particular at molecular scales,
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.080]   when you get down to the level of atoms and so forth,
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.080]   everything is repetitive.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.640]   It's the same thing as just reproduced
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.420]   in different combinations over and over again.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.560]   But as we move through our world,
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.960]   typically we're not looking down at pebbles on the ground
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.680]   or little grains of sand or the pattern of leaves
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.380]   in a particular clover or something of that sort.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.980]   Most of the time we're looking out on landscapes
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.080]   or at people's faces, et cetera.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.360]   And very seldom do we see highly repetitive patterns
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.640]   at that scale.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.440]   So what Eschers do is they essentially reveal to us
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.320]   a fundamental feature about the way
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.960]   that our visual system works,
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.200]   which is that repetitive patterns tend to become noise
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.040]   in our visual system.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.600]   That is our brain encodes repetition
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.600]   as things not to be interested in,
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.220]   and the things that stand out against that repetition
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.440]   as the things to be interested in,
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.600]   so-called signal to noise.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.900]   What Eschers do is they invert the relationship
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.040]   between signal and noise,
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.860]   and they make the repetitive patterns, the signal,
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.520]   and the unusual patterns, the noise.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.700]   In fact, in every Escher, there are unusual patterns,
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.700]   and those completely disappear to us.
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.780]   Now, when you look at an Escher,
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.580]   what you probably see and what I see
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.460]   are just a bunch of birds repeated over and over again,
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.120]   or buildings or staircases repeated over and over again.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.880]   And you may like Eschers and you may not.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.880]   That's not the point.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.440]   Today, we're not talking about taste
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.140]   in particular creative acts.
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.840]   What we're trying to identify here
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.220]   are the rules and mechanisms
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.080]   of what constitutes something creative
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.320]   and why it's creative.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.000]   And the key element here is that what's revealed
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.440]   by an Escher through these repetition patterns
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.560]   is an inversion of the way
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.880]   that our brain normally encodes visual images,
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.480]   and therefore the rule that repetition is suppressed
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.960]   in our visual system,
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.560]   and that unusual visual features are revealed to us,
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.120]   that rule is what pops out to us when we look at an Escher.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.240]   Now, when I say pops out,
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.660]   I don't mean that you look at an Escher and go,
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.480]   "Oh, normally I don't see repetition.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.360]   "Normally I see the unusual stuff, et cetera, et cetera."
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.280]   But there seems to be something about truly creative acts
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.980]   that capture the attention
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.680]   and sometimes the delight of many, many people
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.920]   is that they reveal a fundamental rule
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.240]   about how the brain or the world work.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.360]   Let me give you a different example,
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.200]   also from the visual art world.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.080]   Let me give you the example of Banksy.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.840]   Banksy is an artist
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.440]   that many of you are probably familiar with
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.740]   and probably some of you are not familiar with.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.000]   So for those of you that are not familiar with Banksy,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.440]   Banksy is an artist that most often
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.880]   does two-dimensional artwork.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.700]   So these would be stencils or paintings or drawings,
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.920]   like many artists,
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.880]   and does them in an urban landscape,
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.520]   an actual city or suburban landscape.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.960]   That is, he draws or stencils or graffitis
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.940]   in a very cryptic way, I should say.
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.500]   No one really knows who Banksy is or when he does his art,
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.400]   he just reveals his art by putting it up.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.880]   But he does this in the context of cities
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.500]   and on three-dimensional objects.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.320]   So a good example would be,
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:23.320]   he will stencil next to a phone booth a police officer,
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.280]   or he will graffiti next to an actual fire hydrant,
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.680]   a dog lifting its leg to urinate on that fire hydrant.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.280]   Now, what's interesting about Banksy's
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.160]   is not simply the fact that he puts two-dimensional art
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.000]   onto three-dimensional surfaces
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.360]   in the urban and suburban landscape,
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.400]   because if you think about it,
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.000]   that's been done many, many times before.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   All graffiti is that, all city art and murals is that.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.020]   So what's unique about Banksy?
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.320]   What's unique about Banksy,
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.280]   or I should say Banksy's, the actual art,
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.580]   is that he combines two-dimensional art
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.780]   with a three-dimensional landscape
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.200]   in a way that the concept pops out at you.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.120]   What do I mean by that?
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.640]   Well, in the case of the dog lifting
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.320]   its leg to urinate on the fire hydrant,
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.760]   that's a scene that most people,
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.160]   and in fact, most children are familiar with from cartoons
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.400]   or from our basic understanding of the stereotype of dogs.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.120]   And I must tell you, having owned a male dog,
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.160]   a bulldog, Costello, for many years,
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.720]   hydrants were a particular target for Costello.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.440]   Of course, everything was a particular target
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.580]   for Costello urinating outdoors.
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.420]   Nonetheless, he liked to pee on fire hydrants.
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.960]   That itself is not interesting.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.600]   Seeing a photograph of a dog raising its leg
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.240]   to pee on a fire hydrant is not interesting.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.720]   Seeing a painting of that isn't interesting.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.160]   Seeing an actual dog urinating on a fire hydrant
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.240]   isn't interesting.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.000]   In fact, seeing a painting in two dimensions
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.520]   of a dog raising its leg to,
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.880]   of course it can't actually urinate,
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.680]   but give you the impression that it would urinate
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.240]   on that fire hydrant isn't particularly interesting
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.160]   except for the fact that it reveals to us
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.460]   something fundamental,
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.680]   which is that we tend to pair visual relationships
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.120]   between different objects that share a common theme
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.080]   and then the theme tends to pop out.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.680]   So for instance, the dog raising its leg
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.680]   next to a fire hydrant,
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.440]   even if the dog is drawn in two dimensions
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.480]   and the fire hydrant is in three dimensions,
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.240]   allows the concept of dog and fire hydrant
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.080]   to emerge or pop out at us,
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.800]   which reveals to us something fundamental
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.960]   about how our brain works,
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.080]   which is that our brain encodes concepts and entire stories
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.880]   as symbols of interaction between different objects.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.040]   Let me give you a different example
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.980]   just to make sure that this hits home.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.080]   One of Banksy's more famous paintings
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.120]   is a rather politically charged one,
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.780]   which is of a girl holding a bouquet of balloons
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.320]   and this two-dimensional drawing was put onto the West wall,
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.020]   dividing territories in the Middle East,
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.960]   a very controversial issue.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.080]   The controversies of that issue
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.140]   are not what I want to get into,
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.780]   but I don't think anyone would doubt
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.220]   that it is a controversial issue.
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.080]   The two-dimensional drawing of the girl with the balloons
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:05.780]   on the actual wall turns out to be quite interesting
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.580]   as an art piece because what it reveals to us
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.040]   is the entire controversy around the presence of that wall
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.600]   and the desire for certain people to breach that wall
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.680]   and the desire for other people to insist
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.780]   that that wall not be breached for whatever reason.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.200]   Again, this is not about the particular controversy.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.560]   The point is that a two-dimensional image
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.980]   combined with a three-dimensional structure
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.120]   allows the purpose of that three-dimensional structure
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.680]   and the controversy around that three-dimensional structure
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.100]   to pop out at us in a way that if, for instance,
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.760]   we had just seen a photograph of somebody
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.720]   next to that wall or with a ladder,
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.340]   or if we just seen a drawing of a girl
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.880]   holding a bouquet of balloons
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.400]   on a drawing of that wall to not emerge.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.780]   In other words, it captures two fundamental features
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:51.620]   of the visual system,
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.760]   our ability to encode things in two dimensions
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.100]   and understand symbols,
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.960]   and our ability to understand things in three dimensions.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.180]   And in particular, the wall as a three-dimensional object
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.960]   is really interesting
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.960]   because it's an actual physical barrier.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.160]   So showing it as the actual physical barrier
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.200]   that it is in real space in three dimensions
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.720]   turns out to allow the interaction between those two things,
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.120]   the concept, the controversy, to pop out at us
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.360]   and make us think about that particular controversy
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.440]   and perhaps where we each individually stand
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.000]   on that controversy.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.740]   Now, there are many examples
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.120]   of what I just gave in the visual domain.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.160]   For instance, Rothko's, which are just color on canvas,
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.280]   are a particularly interesting source of information
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.980]   about the way that the brain encodes color.
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.640]   Later, I'll fill in exactly what that information is.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.520]   You may like Rothko's, you may not,
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.360]   but I'll tell you one thing.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.540]   When you look at a Rothko,
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.160]   you are seeing colors in a very different way
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.840]   than you would ever see colors in any other context.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.280]   The fact that they don't have a frame, typically,
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.720]   and the fact that there's no white canvas
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.000]   allows the colors that you see to be novel hues
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.280]   of those colors that you will not see in any other context.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.780]   And in doing so, reveals to you what your brain does
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.740]   in order to understand and extract color.
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.780]   Now, in the context of music, for instance,
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.240]   you will sometimes hear a street musician play a song,
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.440]   maybe a Bob Dylan song or Led Zeppelin song
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.580]   or a Pink Floyd song, pretty closely, pretty accurately
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.780]   to the way that song is played.
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:20.840]   But of course, that's not creative.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.940]   That's just like the photograph
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.200]   or the accurate portrait of somebody's face.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.960]   Or you may hear an acoustic version
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.060]   of what's normally an electric guitar song
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.700]   or electrical song or vice versa.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.860]   Somewhat creative, sometimes sounds even better
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.960]   than the original, but not particularly creative.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.240]   However, each and every one of us
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.900]   has a particular taste in music.
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.820]   Maybe it's classical, maybe it's rock, maybe it's punk,
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.540]   maybe it's hip hop.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.300]   Within each of those genres,
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.480]   I think all of us are familiar with hearing something
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.260]   for the first time and maybe even every time.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.440]   And there's something about the combination
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.500]   of the words and the music,
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.980]   or sometimes just the music or just the words,
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.140]   that allows some feature of it to pop out at us
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.160]   as particularly exciting.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.620]   And when we feel that excitement
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.240]   and we feel that it's really novel,
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.180]   it's different than what we've heard before,
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.400]   I assure you what it's revealing to you
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.480]   is the way that your auditory system
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.140]   and often your auditory and your emotional system
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.140]   encodes information that you hear.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.440]   And again, the rule that it's revealing
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.540]   is not splayed out for you.
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.940]   For instance, it's not told to you,
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.320]   oh, this is the way you normally hear
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.100]   and now you're hearing things differently.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.640]   Sometimes it's the change in, for instance,
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.160]   in the way that words are accented
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.240]   or the way that sentences are constructed.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.560]   This often you'll hear in hip hop,
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.660]   the way that sentences are constructed can be divided up,
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.540]   not as normal declarative sentences,
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.960]   the way that they're typically written,
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.880]   but the way that sentences are chopped up and fractured
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.600]   reveals to us new meaning
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.920]   and in fact enhanced meaning about particular words
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.000]   that we wouldn't see if it was written out as a paragraph
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.560]   and then sung as a script
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.640]   that would be the same as the one that we would read.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.460]   Again, the point is that what is exciting and novel to you
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.080]   is just the way that you hear it,
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.540]   but it's exciting and novel to you
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.120]   because there are circuits within the brain
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.120]   that when we hear or see or feel or experience
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.880]   known elements in new ways that are truly creative,
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.800]   the way that those neural circuits function is changed.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.840]   And when neural circuits change the way that they function
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.140]   simply by way of what comes into our eyes, our ears,
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.700]   and the way that we experience our feelings,
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.200]   there is the release of chemicals,
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.120]   including the release of the chemical dopamine
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.200]   and other neuromodulators as well
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.060]   that make us feel both surprised, delighted,
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.080]   and this is very key,
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.660]   excited in anticipation that we might see it again.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.240]   So with the understanding in mind that true creativity
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.120]   involves the novel combination of some elements,
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.520]   could be notes of music, could be numbers,
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.220]   could be visual elements like lines or colors,
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.640]   could be physical movements, et cetera,
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.740]   but novel combinations of some things
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.440]   that reveal to us something fundamental
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.580]   about the way that our brain and or the world work.
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.800]   And of course, as I mentioned before,
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.740]   that fundamental thing may or may not
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.000]   be consciously accessible to us.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.840]   We may not know what exactly it is that's novel to us,
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:14.720]   but it feels novel and it feels true.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.420]   Well, with that understanding in mind,
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.960]   we therefore can ask what are the underlying principles
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.400]   and neural circuits that underlie the creative process?
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.360]   And the word process here is especially important.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.920]   In fact, if there's one thing I'd really like to impress
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.560]   on everybody is that when thinking about biology,
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.300]   it's almost always better to think about verbs
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.540]   as opposed to nouns.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.240]   So rather than think of creativity as a noun
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.900]   or somebody being creative as an adjective,
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.520]   think about the verb creativity,
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.760]   that is what are the steps required?
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.140]   And therefore, what are the cells and circuits and thoughts,
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:52.220]   et cetera, required in order to be creative?
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.040]   This element of thinking about verbs
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.800]   then allows us to say, okay,
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.600]   what are the various steps in coming up
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.840]   with a creative idea, in testing a creative idea,
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.120]   and then implementing that creative idea?
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.120]   And in doing so, we find,
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.680]   based on the scientific literature,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.920]   that there are basically three major networks
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.200]   within the brain, each of which is responsible
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.120]   for each of the three steps
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.320]   to arrive at something truly creative.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.300]   The first neural circuit involved in creativity
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.760]   is the so-called executive network.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.400]   This is kind of a goofy name because the neural circuits
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.360]   that I'm about to describe do a bunch of other things
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.880]   as well, but they certainly control
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.580]   what are called executive functions.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:34.100]   Executive functions are functions that you and I both have,
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.640]   which is our ability to govern our thinking
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.960]   and our behavior in very deliberate ways.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.360]   And that is largely accomplished
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.600]   through the use of the neural circuitry
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.120]   that sits right behind the forebrain,
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.760]   the so-called prefrontal cortex.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.520]   Now, the prefrontal cortex
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.600]   involves many different subregions.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.900]   It has a bunch of different parts,
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.620]   just like any country has different states,
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.900]   et cetera, and provinces.
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.960]   Executive function involves the prefrontal cortex
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.020]   and some other neural structures.
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.700]   But for sake of this discussion,
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.580]   executive function and the prefrontal cortex
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.660]   are mainly responsible for suppressing action,
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.700]   that is, for eliminating choices
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.960]   among the infinite number of choices that exist,
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.220]   for instance, of what colors to combine on a painting
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.620]   or what lines to draw or what notes to play
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.640]   or what movements to make in a sports endeavor,
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.600]   what numbers to include in a mathematics endeavor,
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.280]   or what words and letters and syllables and sentences
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.100]   to include in writing a creative passage.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.480]   The second network is the so-called default mode network.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.680]   There's a lot of discussion nowadays
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.080]   about the default mode network
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.880]   as it relates to consciousness and meditation, et cetera.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.420]   The default mode network does many different things,
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.040]   but in the context of our discussion about creativity,
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.800]   the default mode network is really the network
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.660]   that starts being engaged when you close your eyes
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.060]   and start paying attention to what's going on
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.500]   in terms of your thinking
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.220]   as opposed to the sensory outside world.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.640]   And the default mode network is especially important
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.940]   for what's called spontaneous imagination.
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.520]   Now, spontaneous imagination
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.140]   is something that you can try at any moment
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.700]   if you were to close your eyes
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.540]   and to try and not pay attention to the sounds around you,
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.900]   but even if you do,
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.160]   to just pay attention to whatever thoughts
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.980]   or feelings emerge when your eyes are closed, okay?
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.580]   By closing your eyes and shutting yourself off
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.080]   to the outside sensory world,
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.320]   you start to engage much more of your brain machinery
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.700]   dedicated towards what's going on inside you,
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.780]   so-called interoception,
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.420]   but also what you're thinking about your thinking,
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.980]   whether or not your thoughts are complete or incomplete,
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.060]   whether or not they are fragmentary in a way
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.000]   that goes from one thought to another
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   distantly in the past or present to future, et cetera.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.560]   Depending on time of day, how well rested you are,
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.640]   how stressed you are, how happy you are,
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.060]   the default mode network will take you through a journey
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.380]   of different types of thoughts,
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.080]   different types of feelings, et cetera.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.100]   The specific types of thoughts and feelings
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.500]   are not as interesting as the fact
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.860]   that when you close your eyes,
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.100]   you're essentially engaging this default mode network,
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.700]   which is essentially the network associated
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:05.180]   with imagination and imagination based on elements
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.660]   that exist only within your head,
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.900]   that is within your brain, okay,
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.900]   and therefore must rely on memory of previous experiences.
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.040]   As soon as you close your eyes,
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.400]   you are shutting yourself off from the sensory world.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.140]   So by definition, you can no longer be bringing in
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.180]   novel experiences in that moment.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.280]   You're relying on your library of existing experiences
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.480]   and your memory of those in order to imagine new things,
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.080]   and you're doing this in a very, in a free associative way.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.500]   You're not trying to imagine new things.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.540]   It's just whatever geysers to the surface, okay?
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.260]   So we've got the executive network,
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.040]   which is involved in suppressing
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.180]   particular thoughts or actions.
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.140]   We have the default mode network,
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.700]   which is involved in imagination,
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.660]   and the default mode network I should mention
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.860]   also involves a sub-region of the prefrontal cortex.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.340]   It's called the medial prefrontal cortex,
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.700]   but other brain regions as well,
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.960]   and then the final element within the circuits
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.340]   underlying creativity is the so-called salience network.
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:01.300]   The salience network is a network of brain regions
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.500]   that involves areas such as the insula,
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.700]   which actually has a complete map of your body surface,
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.000]   as well as some information mapped there
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.660]   about what's going on in the outside world
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.260]   and how those combine with what's going on
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.780]   in your internal landscape that is within your body.
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.540]   Also a brain region called the ACC,
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:20.060]   or excuse me, anterior cingulate cortex, and the amygdala.
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.520]   So a lot of information is mapped
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.200]   within the salience network about how we feel
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.900]   and how we feel in relation to things
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.980]   that are happening around us and within us.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.820]   And the salience network has one main job,
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.780]   which is to pay attention to what's most interesting
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.020]   either in the world or inside us
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.580]   in terms of feelings or experiences, okay?
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.180]   So we've got three networks, executive network,
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.860]   which is there to suppress choices
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.940]   in terms of actions we could take, but decide not to,
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.380]   or things we could think about,
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.340]   but choose not to or try not to.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.720]   The default mode network,
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.900]   which is basically the catalog or library
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.240]   of previous experiences that we have available to us
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:02.440]   that would act as sort of the paints on a pallet
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.560]   or the possible ingredients that could go into a recipe.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.260]   All of that has to, again, arise from previous experience,
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.820]   right, we can't close our eyes
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.940]   and suddenly be able to access all the melodies
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.540]   that we've never heard before,
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.940]   or all our ideas and concepts and knowledge about music
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.660]   if we don't have musical understanding
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.060]   or visual understanding.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.180]   So we're really drawing up the library
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.620]   and that library tends to be rather disorganized,
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.740]   it kind of swirls around, it's not very structured
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.300]   unless we're actively trying to think about something.
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.280]   And then we have the salience network,
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.300]   which is the networks within the brain
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.020]   that decide or make choices about what's most interesting
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.260]   to pay attention to in a given moment.
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.640]   Okay, so those three networks work together
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.260]   to create things.
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.900]   And when I say create things,
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.340]   we again have to really underscore
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.740]   our definition of creativity.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.700]   Creativity is a rearrangement of existing elements
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.640]   into novel combinations that reveal something fundamental
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.440]   about how we or the world works.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.780]   And this is very important,
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.080]   it tends to be things that are useful.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.620]   Now they can merely be useful because they're entertaining
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.360]   or thrilling, they can also have a particular utility
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.500]   or use in the world like a piece of technology
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.980]   that is actually useful like an app or a smartphone
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.300]   or a computer actually has utility or a vehicle.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.300]   There are creative acts that led to the formation
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.420]   of vehicles and computers, et cetera.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.420]   But the point is that just merely coming up
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.340]   with novel combinations of things like wings on a fish tank,
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.540]   that's not creative or it's not creative
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.560]   in any kind of meaningful way because it's simply not useful.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.360]   It doesn't reveal anything fundamental, new or purposeful.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.740]   It doesn't allow us to think about or interact
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.780]   with the world or ourselves in novel ways.
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:50.700]   Whereas things, people, actions and ideas
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.340]   that are truly creative really changed the way
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.900]   that we are able to access the world.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.620]   They act as portals to the world and to ourselves.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.900]   I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.040]   of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.500]   Athletic Greens now called AG1
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.880]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.760]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.440]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.660]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.280]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.720]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.240]   or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.920]   that I need for gut health.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.040]   Our gut is very important.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.160]   It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.340]   with the brain, the immune system,
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.740]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.380]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.400]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.060]   and vital for microbiota health.
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.920]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.060]   of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.000]   that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.880]   and it tastes great.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.320]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.720]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.700]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.020]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.300]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.600]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.000]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.680]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.060]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.960]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.040]   So now you have some idea about the brain areas
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.600]   and networks involved in creativity,
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.800]   but I want to be very clear that anytime we talk
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.560]   about mechanisms and brain areas,
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.480]   what's far more important than the names
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.800]   of those brain areas is an understanding of what they do.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.520]   So if you couldn't remember the anterior cingulate cortex
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.520]   or the fact that the prefrontal cortex is involved
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.680]   in executive function, et cetera, that's fine.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.740]   It's less important that you know the names of things
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.800]   than you understand the action steps that those things take.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.440]   That is the verb actions
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.540]   that those particular brain areas engage
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.360]   in order to arrive at a particular end point.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.540]   And the end point we're talking about today is creativity.
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.080]   I want to discuss creativity
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.080]   in terms of what actually goes into being creative.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.040]   And it turns out there are just two elements
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.920]   and those two elements are now well understood
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.540]   from the perspective of psychology.
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:02.140]   And fortunately, the neuroscience well supports
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.540]   what the psychology says and vice versa.
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.440]   And those two elements that go into coming up
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.140]   with a creative idea and then implementing
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.820]   or developing that creative idea into something real
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.700]   that you and the rest of the world can experience
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:19.020]   are divergent thinking and convergent thinking.
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.900]   And divergent thinking and convergent thinking
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.700]   are very straightforward to understand.
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:29.300]   Divergent thinking is taking some known object
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:34.400]   or event in the world or sport or concept.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.940]   It could be running, it could be a musical note,
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:40.860]   it could be jumping, it could be a particular color
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.500]   on a piece of paper and asking yourself
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:49.180]   how many different things could that thing actually be?
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.180]   You might say, well, running is running,
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.580]   but let's use divergent thinking as a way
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.780]   to illustrate what divergent thinking is.
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.580]   If I show you a picture of somebody running,
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:58.480]   I say, what do you see?
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.340]   And you say, I see somebody running.
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.140]   And then I might give you a divergent thinking task
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.000]   and these tasks are the same ones used
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.220]   in various experiments.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.780]   And I'd say, how many different things can you think about
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.000]   based on this picture that you see of somebody running?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.880]   Now, if you are able to engage divergent thinking,
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.640]   you could say, running to the store,
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:22.780]   running away from a lion, running towards somebody I love,
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.860]   or maybe you have a more elaborate imagination
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:30.200]   and you could say, running in front of a bus to grab a kid
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.180]   so the kid doesn't get hit by the bus
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.780]   or running toward a concert
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.980]   because I'm so excited about the particular concert
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.700]   and then it starts to spool into a story.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.780]   In other words, divergent thinking involves taking
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.540]   one simple, what we would call in neuroscience
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:47.180]   or psychology, stimulus, one image or sound, et cetera,
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.180]   and trying to radiate out from that
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:54.180]   as many different divergent situations, properties,
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:59.340]   characteristics, events, things
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.060]   from that one specific element.
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.820]   So any divergent thinking task would involve exactly that.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:08.040]   I'd show you pictures or play you sounds or words or notes
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:11.340]   or describe to you events in history
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.540]   and try and see how many things can radiate out from that
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:19.540]   into diverse, diverse, even distant types of concepts
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.500]   and pictures, okay?
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.080]   So that's divergent thinking.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.900]   Divergent thinking is really the process
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.300]   that underlies idea generation.
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.340]   And the basis of divergent thinking
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.140]   is that more than one idea is correct.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.600]   In fact, the more ideas that you have about one thing,
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.660]   the better your divergent thinking.
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.060]   So if I were to give you three minutes
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.940]   to list off all the things you can think about
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.580]   related to this pen that I'm holding up,
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.420]   for those of you listening,
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.160]   I'm just holding up a pen in front of me,
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.980]   and you would just write them out or say them out
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:50.320]   over the next three minutes,
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.460]   that would be an example of divergent thinking.
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.680]   However, if you just said black pen, red pen, white pen,
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.900]   green pen, et cetera, that's not very divergent thinking.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.900]   It's only divergent in the context of color space.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.440]   And when I say space, that's just a kind of nerd speak
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.800]   for one particular domain of thinking.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   Whereas if you said red pen, white pen, essay,
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.080]   pen in a door to hold the door open
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.880]   so that someone can return to a building,
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.200]   and you started spooling off a story related to that
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.360]   and why that was important, well, there you go.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.240]   Divergent thinking is essentially taking one element
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.120]   and coming up with many, many answers.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.120]   And in the context of divergent thinking, any answer goes,
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.320]   but as we'll soon learn,
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.120]   not every answer is interesting and relevant.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.320]   That is not every answer helps solve something
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.600]   or reveal something fundamental,
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.800]   and therefore not every divergent answer is truly creative.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.240]   The other aspect of divergent thinking
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.000]   that's really important to understand
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   is that the selection criteria are extremely vague and vast.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.720]   That is, there are no constraints on what you come up with.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.960]   So if I hold up this pen and you say orangutan,
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.520]   that's a perfectly valid divergent idea from this pen
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.680]   because you thought of it and it's distantly related.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.520]   However, we have to remember our earlier rule.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:10.520]   If black pen and orangutan are not linked up in our brain
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.780]   and the observer's brain in any kind of meaningful way,
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.560]   it's only interesting to you
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.240]   because you are the only one that understands the rule
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:22.420]   that underlies the link between this pen and orangutan.
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.240]   Whereas if you come up with something different
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.380]   that somehow tells me and everybody else
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.540]   something interesting about pens or orangutans,
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.560]   now that's a truly creative idea.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.560]   I don't have such an example in mind,
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.920]   but later I'll give you some examples
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.600]   of how you can actually march down the path
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.680]   of divergent thinking and use that executive network
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.040]   to suppress certain options, to cross off certain answers.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.160]   'Cause again, any answer's valid,
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.720]   but not all valid answers are interesting or useful.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.480]   And you can cross those off and arrive
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.320]   at the most interesting and truly creative answer.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.380]   A couple more things about divergent thinking.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.200]   Divergent thinking largely taps
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.680]   into the networks of the brain
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.500]   that are involved in mental flexibility.
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.620]   So this is a different aspect of our prefrontal cortex,
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.720]   which is not based on executive function
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.600]   and our ability to reduce options,
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.400]   but rather areas of the prefrontal cortex
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.260]   that are available to generate multiple options
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.520]   and actually suppress context, right?
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.120]   To forget that pens are just for writing, for instance,
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.560]   and that pens can do other things like hold the door open.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.340]   It's really kind of an unusual use of a pen.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.820]   Again, none of these examples that I'm giving
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.160]   are particularly interesting.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.100]   They're just designed to get you to understand
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.720]   the underlying concept of divergent thinking.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.160]   And then the last thing that I'd like you to know
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.360]   about divergent thinking is that divergent thinking
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.720]   involves a sort of exploration.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:45.680]   It's a wandering through of ideas that you already had
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.760]   in your library, in your memory banks about pens
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.200]   and what pens could be related to
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.020]   and what pens ought not to be related to.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:57.620]   So again, what's really important about creativity
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.660]   is that there has to be the basic building blocks
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.160]   already existing within us.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.640]   This is why it's so important to understand
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.720]   that if you are somebody who really seeks to be creative,
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.200]   you really do need to be somebody who forages for information
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.160]   and structured information in particular,
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.760]   if you are to be creative.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:19.920]   The architect simply can't come up with incredible drawings
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.760]   or plans for buildings without understanding how buildings
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.880]   are put together in the various rules that govern buildings.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.300]   In other words, you can't break rules
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.720]   that you don't understand.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.020]   I think in movies, especially, we have this idea in mind
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.420]   that of this limitless concept
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.780]   or that we have these hidden geniuses
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:41.580]   that somehow have access to all the math knowledge
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.240]   without ever having done any formal math.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.800]   Actually, I was flying back from Texas recently
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.740]   and "Good Will Hunting" was on somebody's screen.
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.760]   I don't tend to watch movies on the plane very often,
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.320]   sometimes, but not often.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.760]   And I was remembering in that movie,
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:57.760]   you've got this math genius who is a janitor at MIT, et cetera
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:00.800]   and apparently just has access to all this knowledge.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.080]   It's a wonderful concept, a very, very,
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.760]   I would say even exceedingly rare thing
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.000]   to occur in the world.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.360]   Sure, there are people who seem to have a natural talent
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.280]   for mathematics or for something else,
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.960]   but this idea that there are incredible geniuses among us
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.520]   that just spontaneously have so much knowledge,
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:23.320]   that's by far the exception rather than the rule, of course,
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.380]   and may not even actually exist.
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.040]   I'm sure someone will put in the comments examples
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.100]   where this actually exists.
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.940]   More often than not, what you find is that people
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.400]   who have extreme virtuosity in a given area
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:37.580]   put many, many years into developing the basic substrates,
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.640]   the basic building blocks of whatever it is
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.200]   their craft happens to be where they demonstrate virtuosity.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.880]   So this is very important to understand.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.880]   Nonetheless, divergent thinking is the critical element
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.480]   for initiating the creative process.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.680]   Again, thinking about creativity as a verb.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:57.840]   And divergent thinking involves taking some starting point,
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.520]   in this case, a pen, and then radiating out from that
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.360]   in a fairly unconstrained,
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.240]   what biologists call a random walk,
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.740]   just kind of wandering through your thought space
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.480]   and memory space about what could be related to this pen.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.240]   Now, on the flip side of creativity is the implementation
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.580]   of specific combinations of things and testing those
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.240]   to see whether or not they are interesting, relevant,
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:23.160]   or delight us or other people or scare us or other people
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.640]   or thrill us or other people.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.520]   In other words, a testing of whether or not
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.440]   there's some fundamental rule to emerge.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.840]   Again, I'm going to repeat this many, many times
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:33.680]   throughout this episode,
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.040]   and I'm not going to apologize for that
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.500]   because I think it's so important to understand
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.880]   that creativity is not just novel combinations.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.840]   They're novel combinations of things
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.600]   that reveal something fundamental
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.440]   and that often pop out to us, if not every time,
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.740]   certainly most of the time that we see that thing.
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.840]   It almost never seems to be the case
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:54.080]   that something truly creative dulls in its expression.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.420]   And that's because what it's repeating to us
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.320]   over and over again is this fundamental rule
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.080]   that normally we can't see or hear or experience
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.760]   in the absence of this creative act.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.880]   So the second part of creativity where things are tested
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.920]   and where truly creative elements are discovered
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.480]   is in convergent thinking.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.580]   And convergent thinking is, as the name suggests,
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.320]   just the opposite of divergent thinking.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.300]   Convergent thinking would be, for example,
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.680]   if I give you an image or I tell you the following things,
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:26.440]   I say wing, water, and engine.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.540]   The concept that I happen to have in mind
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:33.740]   is that of a plane that can land on water, right?
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:35.600]   Most planes don't land on water
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.900]   or not intended to land on water.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.080]   One would hope that their plane doesn't land on water
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.340]   unless it's a plane designed to land on water.
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:45.760]   But in this case, a plane that can land on water
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.700]   is one of the very few answers
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:53.700]   that can combine wing, water, and engine, right?
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.100]   I'm sure there are other answers.
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.320]   There are other convergent thinking modes
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.840]   that can take you to an answer that would be valid,
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.080]   but there are not many.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.640]   And here, what's really most important
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.760]   is that I'm not asking you to spool out
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.760]   or to radiate out from these three things.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.940]   Rather, I'm asking you to combine them in some way
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.280]   that makes sense in the real world.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.120]   And indeed, there are planes that can land on water
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:19.460]   and wing, water, and engine combined within those things.
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:20.860]   They are fundamental features.
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.920]   They are in fact necessary, but not sufficient,
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.300]   for having a plane that can land on water.
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.220]   Okay, so that's just one example of convergent thinking.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.120]   And a convergent thinking task
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.240]   would involve you being given a list of two or three
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.560]   or maybe even five different things,
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.400]   and then for each of those
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.900]   two or three or five different things,
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.440]   as quickly as you can to come up with a single answer
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.380]   that binds all of those in a real world concept
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.880]   that obey the laws of nature or physics in some way.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.800]   For instance, you could just come up with some answer
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:53.220]   that said a bird that swallowed an engine
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.880]   and that happens to be a seabird.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.200]   You could come up with that,
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.640]   but that actually is not something that happens
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.440]   or is very typical at all.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:03.060]   And so it seems like kind of a mishmash of things
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.320]   that are really just designed
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.000]   for you to try and accomplish an answer
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.300]   rather than something real,
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.000]   such as a plane that lands on water.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.620]   Okay, the point here is that divergent thinking
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:16.140]   is one aspect of our cognition, of our thinking,
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.680]   and convergent thinking is a very distinct aspect
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.020]   of our cognition.
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.580]   In fact, one of the critical requirements
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:26.900]   for convergent thinking is also to access our memory banks
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.620]   and our understanding about the outside world,
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.100]   just as it were with divergent thinking,
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:35.140]   but it requires more focus and more persistence.
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:37.540]   In fact, if we were to come up with a key rule
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.200]   for divergent thinking, it would be,
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.360]   you almost want to have just enough focus
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:44.260]   to remember what the initial object or thing
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.260]   that was mentioned was to keep that in mind
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.760]   so that your answers don't become completely random.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:53.140]   But the more distant and everywhere in between
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.460]   that you can generate answers,
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.700]   that is the things that are very close to pens,
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:01.480]   black pen, red pen versus pen and doorstop,
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.940]   pen acting as a doorstop,
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:08.520]   one is very close, red pen is very close to black pen,
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.260]   doorstop is pretty far from black pen.
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:13.780]   So that's the idea is that you want to explore
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.500]   and undergo a range of exploration of different ideas.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.940]   Whereas with convergent thinking,
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.100]   you're really trying to bind these things together.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.760]   And so the key element for convergent thinking
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.220]   is the aspect of persistence and focus.
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:30.180]   And that's why convergent thinking in many ways
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.540]   feels harder than divergent thinking.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:33.940]   It feels like there's an answer
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:35.660]   and I want to get the answer right and I can't solve it.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.660]   It's a puzzle and it's a puzzle
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.040]   that relies on very distinct brain circuits
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.140]   from divergent thinking.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.460]   Which brain circuits?
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.400]   Well, that's what we're going to describe next.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.160]   And again, this is not just going to be a list
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.500]   of different brain circuits with different names
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:49.340]   doing different things.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.620]   That wouldn't be useful to you or to me.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:55.880]   Rather, what you're about to learn is truly incredible.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.580]   What it is is we're going to talk about one single molecule,
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:03.080]   dopamine, which is a molecule most typically associated
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.060]   with motivation and desire and drive
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.120]   and feelings of pleasure in some cases,
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.500]   but that actually resides
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.320]   within four different networks in the brain.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.060]   Today, we're going to talk about two of those networks.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:16.740]   And dopamine acting in one network
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:21.000]   directly underlies divergent thinking.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.380]   Whereas dopamine in another brain network
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.580]   underlies convergent thinking.
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.860]   And if at this point in this episode, you're thinking,
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:29.140]   okay, when am I going to get the tools
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.640]   to understand creativity and how to be creative?
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.380]   What I can assure you is that if you understand
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:35.380]   divergent thinking, which hopefully now you do,
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:38.460]   and you can understand what convergent thinking is,
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.320]   and you can understand that dopamine is responsible
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.460]   for both divergent thinking and convergent thinking,
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.420]   but through separate pathways.
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.740]   Well, then if you can understand
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.400]   how those two separate pathways work
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.200]   and how to engage them differentially,
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:58.000]   therein lie the tools that you can use both to explore ideas,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.480]   in other words, find what it is that could be creative,
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:04.860]   and then systematically test each of those ideas
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:06.340]   for what is truly creative.
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:08.060]   That is what meets the criteria
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:10.580]   for something that is novel and truly useful
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:12.220]   and informs us about something
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:15.080]   that we've never seen, heard, or felt before.
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.620]   Let's just take a moment to talk about
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:19.580]   the incredible molecule that is dopamine.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.240]   Many people are familiar with dopamine
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:24.500]   from the concept of quote unquote dopamine hits,
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.760]   which is popular language describing
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.260]   the feeling of pleasure that we get
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:32.280]   from pretty much anything that we like
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.380]   or that we continue to engage in repeatedly.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:36.020]   So some people will talk about the dopamine hit
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.460]   that they get from somebody attractive
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.940]   that they like texting them back,
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.580]   or the dopamine hit that they get from social media,
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:44.380]   or the dopamine hit that they get from sugar,
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.180]   or the dopamine hit that they get from this or from that.
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.740]   To be honest, the concept of dopamine hits
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:52.480]   is not one that I favor because in general,
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.060]   whenever people talk about dopamine hits,
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:55.700]   typically they're talking about activities
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:59.640]   such as social media, which dopamine may be involved
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.640]   at some level, but often it's the case
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.800]   that the behavior associated with that thing,
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.100]   in this case, social media, is more of the compulsive nature
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:11.020]   rather than an active seeking of something
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.460]   with positive anticipation.
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:14.460]   And that's really what dopamine is about,
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.720]   at least in the context of one of its major functions
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.560]   in the brain.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:22.420]   Dopamine is really about motivation and desire and movement.
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.620]   And it makes sense why motivation, desire, and movement
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:27.240]   would be linked up through a common,
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.340]   in this case, neuromodulator or chemical like dopamine.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:34.420]   Because throughout evolution, if we were excited for
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:36.980]   or motivated to pursue something,
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:40.000]   we had to move in order to get it, to obtain it.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.460]   And in general, we can frame dopamine under the umbrella
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.740]   of dopamine tends to be involved in neural circuits
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.160]   in the brain that are involved in processes
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.860]   that are taking us beyond the confines of our skin.
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:53.260]   That is, that motivate us to go do something
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.180]   in terms of action in the world.
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.560]   Now, that statement might seem distantly placed
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.340]   from a discussion about creativity,
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:01.900]   but as we'll learn a little bit later,
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:06.220]   one of the most useful tools for engaging creativity
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:10.540]   and becoming more creative is to think about action elements
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.380]   within a narrative.
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.760]   That is, things that we and others can do
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:17.820]   in order to discover new rules through actual movement.
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:20.060]   That's a little bit cryptic, forgive me,
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:21.420]   but I promise I'll return to it later
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:23.500]   and I will make it crystal clear.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.860]   There are four major circuits in the brain that use dopamine.
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:29.300]   Although I should mention,
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:30.780]   there are additional circuits as well.
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.020]   In fact, your eye even contains neurons
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.000]   that release dopamine that control the sensitivity
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.460]   of your eye at different times of day, to light, et cetera.
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.700]   The four major circuits in the brain
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:41.080]   that utilize dopamine however,
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.460]   are used for four major purposes.
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:44.940]   And I'll describe what those are.
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:48.340]   First of all, is a neural circuit that uses dopamine
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.620]   among other things, but certainly relies on dopamine
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:53.480]   in a critical way to engage movement,
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.940]   including eye movements.
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:56.300]   And we will return to eye movements
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:59.100]   and why they're so important for understanding creativity
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:02.380]   and maybe even for generating creativity a little bit later.
[00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:03.780]   The name of the circuit, again,
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:05.820]   is less important than what it does,
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.540]   but the name of this circuit, for those that want to know,
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:11.460]   is the so-called nigrostriatal pathway, okay?
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:14.960]   The substantia nigra is a brain area that is very dark,
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.940]   that projects to an area called the dorsal striatum.
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.260]   It contains a bunch of sub regions.
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:20.900]   So again, for those of you that really geek out
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.140]   on this stuff, great.
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.700]   You can learn these names and retain them in your memory.
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.760]   If you don't care about names, don't worry about it,
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.040]   just discard the names.
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.180]   But areas of the brain like the caudate and putatum
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:32.060]   and the dorsal striatum receive input
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:33.900]   from the substantia nigra.
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:36.500]   In neuroanatomy, when we name something,
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:40.540]   we say the origin of that thing and where it connects through.
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:43.620]   So nigrostriatal tells you that there is a connection
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:44.980]   between the substantia nigra,
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:46.620]   'cause it came first, nigrostriatal,
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:48.380]   and then striatal is where it ends up.
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.200]   So nigrostriatal pathway is involved
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.340]   in generating bodily movements,
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:54.740]   it's involved in eye movements,
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.700]   and it is actually a brain area that's engaged
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:00.020]   when you think about movement.
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.060]   You can just have a story in your mind about walking
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:03.860]   or a story in your mind about running
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.380]   or a story in your mind about driving.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:08.740]   This area is engaged, very interesting brain area.
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.140]   And so that's the first circuit,
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:11.300]   very important to understand.
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.940]   And I'll tell you right now, that is the brain circuit
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:18.940]   that is engaged when you undergo divergent thinking.
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.320]   Now, that itself should be interesting, right?
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.840]   Even if you don't remember any of the names
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.180]   of the things I just told you,
[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:25.200]   that you have a brain circuit
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.740]   that even if you just think about walking,
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:28.900]   it becomes more active,
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.880]   and the dopamine is involved in that brain activity.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.460]   And if you recall, divergent thinking involves
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:38.740]   taking a concept as boring as a pen
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.540]   and thinking about other concepts
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.840]   that could link up with that pen in some sort of way,
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.620]   logical or illogical, right?
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:47.720]   The bridge could be completely abstract
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:51.160]   and really fantastical with a bunch of different ideas
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:53.580]   in between, like a pen acting as a doorstop
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:55.720]   because of some situation where you need to run downstairs
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:57.320]   in a fire and get back upstairs quickly
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.480]   to rescue somebody very divergent
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.200]   or as divergent as black pen to red pen.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.640]   But what's amazing is that that same circuit
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:08.480]   is the one that's involved in physical movement,
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.860]   in generating and thinking about physical movement.
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:12.900]   That turns out to be vitally important
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.980]   for tapping into the creativity process.
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:16.520]   So really frame that up in your mind
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:17.720]   or commit it to memory.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.400]   Now, the second dopamine circuit associated with creativity
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:23.180]   is the one associated with convergent thinking,
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:24.300]   which again is the kind of thinking
[00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.660]   where there's a specific correct answer.
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:29.340]   It requires focus and it requires persistence.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.860]   And the name of that circuit,
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:32.820]   again, the name isn't as important as what it does,
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:37.520]   but the name of that circuit is the mesocortical pathway.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:41.140]   The mesocortical pathway is involved in motivation
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:44.140]   and it has an emotional component too.
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:45.780]   Now, we come clear in a few minutes
[00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:48.100]   why that emotional component is vital,
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:50.220]   but this is a circuit that originates in a brain structure
[00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:53.120]   called the lateral ventral tegmental area.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.480]   Again, a bunch of words, you can remember it if you want,
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:57.720]   lateral ventral tegmental area,
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.460]   or you can not worry about the name.
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.320]   And it connects to the prefrontal cortex,
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:03.260]   that area just behind the forehead.
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:05.940]   And this mesocortical area is involved in motivation
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:09.440]   and emotion and is critical for focus and persistence.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.860]   It is distinct from a very nearby area,
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:13.560]   just sitting right next door,
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.240]   the so-called mesolimbic area,
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:19.960]   which is involved in desire and feelings of reward.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.360]   And this is the area that is associated more typically
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:26.520]   with addictive behaviors or compulsive behaviors.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.900]   We're going to leave out the discussion
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:29.880]   about the mesolimbic pathway for now,
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.640]   because it's not critical
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.040]   to divergent or convergent thinking,
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:36.980]   and it's not critical to the process of creativity,
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:38.840]   at least as far as we know.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.260]   But I mention it because it is the third
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:41.800]   in the four dopaminergic circuits.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.480]   And then the fourth circuit,
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.880]   certainly one I've never talked about before
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.440]   in this podcast,
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.320]   which is doesn't mean anything
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.920]   except that we haven't gotten to it yet,
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:53.380]   is the tuberoinfundibular pathway.
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.560]   And that is the pathway associated with dopamine
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:58.920]   and your pituitary gland and the release of hormones
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.080]   in particular that travel to the ovary.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.560]   If you have ovaries or to your testes,
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:04.240]   if you have testes and trigger the release
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.320]   of things like estrogen and testosterone, et cetera,
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.080]   dopamine is intimately involved in that circuitry.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.560]   Again, not the topic of today's discussion.
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.600]   For today's discussion,
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.760]   we want to remember that there's a dopamine circuit
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.160]   called the nigrostriatal circuit,
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:22.520]   which is involved in movement and divergent thinking.
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.920]   And that alone should set a flag up for you.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.320]   Like, wow, just thinking about new ideas
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.000]   has something to do with movement,
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.360]   with physical movement.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:35.360]   And the dopamine circuit that is the mesocortical pathway,
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.720]   which is the one that's associated
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:39.400]   with motivation and emotion.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.000]   And that's the one required for persistence and focus
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.440]   for convergent thinking.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:46.400]   Why am I telling you all of this about dopamine?
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:49.100]   Well, it turns out that dopamine
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:53.900]   creates a certain number of responses in the brain and body
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:57.000]   when it is active in one or the other of these circuits.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.760]   And just for sake of simplicity,
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.140]   so I don't have to keep saying nigrostriatal
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:04.960]   and mesocortical, here going forward,
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.280]   I'm going to talk about the dopamine circuit
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.440]   that's associated with divergent thinking
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.440]   or the dopamine circuit associated with convergent thinking.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.240]   And again, divergent thinking and convergent thinking
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.680]   are the two processes that have to occur,
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:20.120]   usually first divergent, then convergent thinking,
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:21.480]   then back and forth and back and forth
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.800]   in order to arrive at something creative.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.560]   Divergent thinking is about exploration.
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:27.280]   Convergent thinking is about testing things
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.360]   and coming up with things that are the right answer,
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:30.680]   that feel right.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.560]   And we will better define what right means
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.660]   a little bit later,
[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:37.640]   but you already sort of know right in this context
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:40.900]   is when you have some combination of elements
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.420]   or some idea or some written passage or some music
[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:46.840]   or some physical action that you just know,
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.800]   this is really novel and really cool,
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:54.800]   or people see it or hear it or taste it and say,
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.780]   this is really novel and really cool.
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.620]   And they don't necessarily know why,
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:01.740]   it's just different in a way that feels true.
[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:03.400]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:06.480]   and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.960]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.480]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.120]   to help you better understand your body
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:14.960]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.620]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:20.040]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.040]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:24.640]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.700]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:30.240]   however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.760]   lipids and hormones and so forth,
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.520]   but you don't know what to do with those data.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.280]   InsideTracker solves that problem
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.640]   and makes it very easy for you to understand
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:40.640]   what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.480]   maybe even supplementation-based interventions
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:46.080]   you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.200]   of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids,
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.880]   and other things that impact your immediate
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:52.200]   and long-term health to bring those numbers
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.000]   into the ranges that are appropriate
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.880]   and indeed optimal for you.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.260]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.800]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.440]   and get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.920]   Now, I realize that for some of you listening
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.460]   to this episode, we are probably at the point
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:13.600]   along the pathway of concept and definition and mechanism
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:17.920]   that leaves you in a place of real wanting a tool.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.840]   And so I promise that I'm going to get into more tools,
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.880]   but to satisfy you and to make sure
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.720]   that you do indeed understand that there are tools
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:27.960]   that can emerge from the information
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.240]   that you already now have in mind.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.160]   I do want to share with you one particular tool
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:35.480]   from the literature that has been demonstrated
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:38.800]   over and over again to support and build
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:41.640]   and enhance divergent thinking.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.160]   And I also want to share with you a tool
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:44.880]   that has been shown from the scientific literature
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.320]   to enhance convergent thinking
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.600]   because both convergent and divergent thinking
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.620]   are critical for the creative process.
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:55.620]   Now, I should emphasize that some people out there,
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:58.800]   either by training or by genetics or by both,
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:01.280]   will be naturally better
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.720]   at divergent or convergent thinking.
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:07.400]   And in fact, we now know in a kind of almost poetic
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:12.360]   kind of way that naturally occurring variations in genes
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.020]   which underlie naturally occurring variations
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:18.160]   in the percentage of dopamine
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.640]   in one set of brain circuits versus another
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:24.320]   do seem to relate to whether or not people
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.300]   are naturally good at divergent thinking
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:27.760]   or convergent thinking.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.260]   Now, that's a very nature-based explanation
[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:33.260]   for why some people are better at divergent thinking
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:35.660]   and other people are better at convergent thinking.
[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:38.260]   Nature and nurture is something
[00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:40.800]   that can never really be teased apart exactly
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.000]   because of course, if someone has a natural proclivity
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.640]   for something based on their genes,
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:48.260]   you can't often separate that from their parents
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:51.000]   because we inherit our genes from our parents.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.320]   Although, even in cases where people are raised away
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:55.820]   from their parents through adoption, et cetera,
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:59.320]   it's very hard to separate nature and nurture
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.340]   because somebody with a natural proclivity for things
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:04.120]   might engage in those things more, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.900]   The point is that for those of you
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.400]   that are very, very good at divergent thinking
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.420]   or very, very good at convergent thinking,
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:12.840]   some of that might have been inherited,
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.800]   but more than likely some of that depended
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.580]   on the kinds of activities that you engaged in
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.340]   in your early years,
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:23.280]   in particular in the years between age five and 25.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.940]   And for those of you that are aged between five and 25,
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:29.220]   all I can say is please learn to engage
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:32.140]   both divergent and convergent thinking as much as possible
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:33.760]   because you will enhance your ability for both.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.560]   For those of you 25 and older,
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.380]   you can still enhance your ability
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:39.480]   to engage divergent and convergent thinking.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:43.400]   And the fortunate news, the equalizer, I should say,
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.400]   is that regardless of whether or not
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.000]   you are naturally better at divergent or convergent thinking
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.260]   or you acquired it through activities,
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:52.240]   you need both in order to be creative.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.600]   So what we know is that in order
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.040]   to engage divergent thinking,
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.000]   we need access to our memory banks.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.640]   We need to come up with possibilities
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.760]   and those possibilities can only come from
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.520]   what's contained within our memory systems of our brain,
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.920]   areas like the hippocampus, et cetera.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.540]   But the names, again, don't matter.
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:09.860]   We just know that if we are going to come up
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.520]   with novel combinations of things
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.960]   or novel uses of things or totally new ideas
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.520]   about how objects or notes of music or foods or tastes
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.720]   or whatever can be combined,
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.560]   we have to do that with preexisting knowledge.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.860]   And yet what we need to do
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.000]   in order to engage divergent thinking
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   is suppress what is called autobiographical narratives.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.280]   And in particular autobiographical narratives,
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.060]   we need to discard with judgments
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:38.080]   about how certain combinations of things
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.800]   impacted us in the past.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.860]   Now, this is, I think, is what people mean
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:44.900]   when they encourage the exploration of creativity
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.920]   by so-called boundary exploration.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.840]   You hear about this a lot
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.040]   in kind of the self-help and psychology literature.
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.080]   And I'm not at all disparaging of that literature,
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:55.360]   although rarely does it define exactly how and why
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.040]   to go about being more creative
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.720]   or in this case to be more divergent in our thinking.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.700]   So they'll say, you know, you have to take risks
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.040]   or you have to suppress judgment,
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.640]   but how do you actually do that?
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.240]   Well, there's a wonderful paper
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.460]   that talks about one way to do it.
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.080]   One way to do it is what's called
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.920]   open monitoring meditation
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.280]   or even just open monitoring thinking.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.600]   And just to make what could otherwise
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.960]   be a somewhat complex section here,
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.080]   very simple, what I'll also tell you is that
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.020]   if you want to enhance convergent thinking,
[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.320]   you can do that a number of ways,
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.160]   but you can do that in particular
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.920]   by doing a different type of meditation or thought process,
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.520]   which is called focused attention meditation.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.680]   So let's talk about open monitoring meditation
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.020]   and why it's so useful for enhancing divergent thinking,
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:42.280]   this critical element of the creative process.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.900]   First of all, open monitoring meditation
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:49.000]   and focused attention meditation
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.160]   can be performed the exact same way physically.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.140]   You can sit there, eyes closed.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.840]   I don't care if you're in a Lotus position,
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:56.680]   it doesn't really matter.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.520]   You're lying down, you're standing up.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.920]   You could in theory do open monitoring meditation
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.000]   with eyes open,
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.760]   and that would be an interesting variant on it.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:06.200]   But for sake of the discussion right now,
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.580]   let's just focus on the study
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:11.000]   that talks about these specific tools
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.320]   and the way that they were used in the study.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.960]   The title of the paper that I'm essentially summarizing
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.960]   is called open monitoring meditation
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.860]   reduces the involvement of brain regions
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:21.660]   related to memory function.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.720]   Now, right off the bat,
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.480]   that should cue you to something interesting.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:27.080]   Something about divergent thinking and open monitoring
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:30.080]   is related to suppressing memory.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.360]   But as you recall, just a few moments ago,
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.200]   I said that in order to engage in divergent thinking,
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.380]   you need to kind of kill off the narratives
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.520]   of what has to be related to what
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.760]   and come up with new narratives.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.060]   You still need to understand possibilities,
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:46.800]   but you need to forget prior understanding
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.640]   of what those possibilities have to be
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.160]   and start thinking about what those possibilities could be.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.280]   And so that it turns out involves suppression
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.400]   of certain brain areas.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.860]   Open monitoring meditation is typically done
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.680]   for about 10 to 30 minutes,
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.560]   although it could be longer.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.920]   And unlike other forms of meditation
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.600]   where you sit and concentrate on your breathing
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.320]   and trying to redirect your thinking back to your breathing
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:14.000]   or to your posture or to a chant or a mantra,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.120]   open monitoring meditation is simply a matter
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.120]   of having you sit there or lie down, close your eyes,
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:23.960]   and to allow whatever surfaces in your mind to surface.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.920]   And what you practice is the practice of non-judgment.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.400]   Now, non-judgment itself is a little bit
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.360]   of an abstract theme because of course,
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.280]   the moment you say don't judge,
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.780]   you and others start to judge.
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:35.980]   It's just the way that the brain works.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:37.440]   You say, don't think about an elephant.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.260]   You think about an elephant.
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:39.140]   That's a perfectly natural.
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:42.120]   You go to an edge of a bridge or a cliff
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.280]   and you think about jumping off
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.680]   even though you don't, please don't, jump off.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.280]   And that's because it's part of the circuitry
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.640]   that's keeping you from jumping off
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.140]   is the thought about what would happen if you did, okay?
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.060]   So open monitoring meditation
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:55.200]   involves dedicating a certain amount of time
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.800]   where you close your eyes and whatever thoughts arise,
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:01.440]   whatever emotions arise, whatever ideas arise,
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.560]   to watch those and take an inventory of them,
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.280]   to just merely watch them show up and pass
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.040]   or maybe become fixated on them for some period of time
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.120]   or maybe even just one for a long period of time,
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.160]   all of that is fine.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:16.160]   In other words, whatever surfaces, surfaces.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.780]   That's open monitoring meditation
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.440]   and that we know from brain imaging studies
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.240]   and we know from measurements of dopamine
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.680]   in particular brain circuits
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:26.600]   and we know from people who train
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.500]   with open monitoring meditation on a regular basis
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.640]   improves divergent thinking capability.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:37.600]   So in terms of tools, practicing open monitoring meditation
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.460]   or what I would just call open monitoring thinking
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:42.500]   is going to be immensely useful.
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.800]   And this is actually an opportunity to cue up something
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.800]   that I mentioned in our episode on meditation
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.960]   which goes deep into the different kinds of meditation
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.260]   involving focus inward and outward, et cetera.
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:52.680]   You're welcome to check out that episode.
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.460]   It's at hubermanlab.com.
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:57.840]   But the point is that rather than think about
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.120]   the word meditation, which carries a bunch of ideas
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:04.320]   about what it is and what it isn't and how to do it,
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.040]   meditation is really just a perceptual exercise.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.400]   For instance, you could do a meditation
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.660]   where you look at a single point on a wall for five minutes
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:14.260]   and redirect your focus to that single point on a wall
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.020]   over and over again every time your mind drifts
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:19.000]   as it no doubt would, or to atone in the room.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.160]   You could attend to that and redirect to that.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.500]   Rather than think about it as a meditation,
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.740]   it's really just a perceptual exercise.
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:26.580]   That's all that meditation is.
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.300]   So open monitoring meditation
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.880]   is really just a form of perception
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.220]   where you're paying attention,
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.100]   you're perceiving your thoughts
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.320]   without laying judgment to those thoughts
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.340]   or trying not to lay judgment to those thoughts.
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.080]   And what people find is that they very quickly,
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.140]   within a few days,
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:42.260]   get better at doing open monitoring meditation.
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:45.120]   And fortunately, within just a few days,
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.180]   and certainly within about a week or more of practice,
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:50.140]   and it doesn't even have to be daily practice,
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.940]   so although of course daily practice
[01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.680]   will accelerate the process further,
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.060]   people become significantly better at divergent thinking.
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:58.520]   And that's because of the dopamine circuits
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:01.380]   and in particular along the nigrosteroidal pathway
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:02.420]   becoming more active.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.540]   And the wonderful thing is that when you repeat a practice
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:07.680]   and a particular neural circuit is engaged
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.660]   over and over again deliberately,
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:11.820]   that neural circuit becomes easier to engage,
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.980]   so-called neuroplasticity.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.160]   So I would encourage any of you
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.020]   that want to explore the creative process
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:21.480]   for whatever reason or get better at the creative process,
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.100]   dedicate some amount of time,
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.900]   maybe even just five minutes every other day
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.980]   to doing this open monitoring meditation.
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.220]   I've tried this meditation.
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:32.100]   It's actually quite fun to do
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:35.180]   because at least to me, it feels a lot easier
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:38.860]   than the meditation associated with convergent thinking.
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:40.980]   Now, the convergent thinking meditation
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:43.460]   is the so-called focus attention meditation,
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.600]   and that's also described in the same study,
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.460]   and other studies have explored
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:49.860]   which particular brain networks it involves,
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:53.400]   and I can just tell you that focused attention meditation,
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.340]   which you can think of or I'd prefer that you think of
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.160]   just as a perceptual exercise,
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.620]   involves sitting or lying down, closing your eyes,
[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:01.540]   focusing either on your breath
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:03.180]   or some element of your body,
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:07.460]   could be the tops of your knees or the clasp of your hands.
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:10.460]   It could be focusing on an auditory tone.
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:12.060]   You could even do it eyes open
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:15.100]   and stare at a point on a wall or a flame of light,
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.540]   whatever it happens to be
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:18.360]   that allows you to redirect your focus
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:22.280]   to a particular location or idea or sound.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:26.700]   That is known to improve your ability
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.500]   to engage convergent thinking,
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:32.620]   to quickly parse through or analyze
[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:34.500]   a bunch of different choices,
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:38.580]   and to persist in choice selection
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:41.360]   and therefore more rapidly arrive at the correct answer.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:42.540]   This is well-established,
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:43.900]   and in fact, in the episode that I did
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:45.860]   with a wonderful guest, Dr. Wendy Suzuki
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:46.860]   from New York University,
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:49.140]   she talked about how a daily meditation
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:52.100]   of about 10 to 13 minutes performed for about eight weeks,
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:52.920]   that's what they explored,
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:56.740]   and that study greatly increases people's ability to focus
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:59.220]   and in fact, their memory, and that's exactly the point,
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.460]   which is that convergent thinking, as I mentioned before,
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:06.160]   requires persistence, focus, and access to specific memories.
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:08.540]   So if you are somebody who wants to get better at focusing,
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.300]   that is the meditation for you.
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.660]   However, because today we're talking about creativity,
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:15.020]   if you are somebody who wants to get better
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:17.140]   at divergent thinking and convergent thinking,
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:19.900]   the two elements of creativity, that is,
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:23.140]   I would encourage you to do a dual meditation,
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:27.540]   that is a meditation that starts with open monitoring
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.060]   for maybe five to 10 minutes,
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:32.980]   and then transitions to focused attention
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:34.600]   for maybe five to 10 minutes,
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:38.420]   because the positioning of divergent thinking
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:41.020]   and then convergent thinking close together
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:44.380]   more closely resembles what the creative process really is
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:45.940]   and what it typically involves.
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:48.680]   Most of us would love to have a situation
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:52.620]   where we can spend a morning or a day or a week brainstorming
[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:53.580]   just kind of brainstorming.
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:56.140]   Whatever we think about is fine, that's divergent thinking.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:58.660]   Whatever elements, just throw them up on the whiteboard.
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:00.260]   We sometimes see people and companies
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:01.540]   doing this at retreats.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.580]   You're bringing people into a novel environment.
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:04.900]   You say, "Let's just forget all the rules
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:08.700]   and let's just come up with new ideas about something,
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:11.220]   new uses of something, new strategies."
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:13.700]   And nothing is too crazy, nothing's off limits.
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:17.140]   And sure, that's a useful exercise, so-called brainstorming,
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:19.200]   but at some point there's the requirement
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.260]   to cross off things.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:22.020]   And typically that's done later in the retreat
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.740]   or later in the meeting or later in the weekend.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.740]   And that's a wonderful way to approach creativity
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:29.300]   and to try and be creative.
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:32.380]   But not a lot of people train for that on a regular basis.
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:35.240]   So what I just described to you are research-tested tools
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.920]   for training for divergent thinking and convergent thinking.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.580]   And I would encourage people who are interested
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:42.500]   in being more creative to try and do these
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.880]   on a somewhat regular basis, if not every day,
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.660]   then certainly a few times a week or more.
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.240]   Certainly the more you do it,
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.300]   the better you're going to get at it.
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.400]   That's well demonstrated in the literature.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.820]   And if you're somebody who's very consistent
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:56.660]   doing maybe five minutes of open monitoring meditation
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.800]   and five minutes immediately after
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.100]   of focused attention meditation daily,
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.240]   you can expect that you will get very, very good
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:06.460]   at these processes very, very quickly.
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:08.680]   Now, I'm not going to go into a lengthy description
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:11.040]   of the different lines of evidence
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.940]   that the corresponding areas of the brain are active
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:15.940]   in each of these different kinds of meditation.
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:17.500]   But what I can tell you is that there have been
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:20.900]   some beautiful, what are called loss of function studies
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:24.580]   where particular brain areas are either depleted of dopamine
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.620]   or where dopamine in some cases,
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:28.300]   I guess what we would call gain of function studies,
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.020]   although not the kind of gain of function studies
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.180]   associated with virology,
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:32.620]   different gain of function studies
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.860]   where you enhance the level of dopamine in the brain.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:37.460]   What you find is that both divergent
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:41.300]   and convergent thinking are enhanced
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.500]   when levels of dopamine are elevated.
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.500]   Now, we're not necessarily talking about pharmacology here.
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:49.240]   It turns out that there are other ways to elevate dopamine
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.220]   that make us better at divergent and convergent thinking.
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:55.620]   In particular, by using mood.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:59.780]   And now I'd like to talk about what mood you are in
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:02.180]   when you happen to start a creative process
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.940]   or try and do a sort of training
[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:08.100]   such as open monitoring meditation or focused meditation,
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:12.160]   how your mood relates to your level of dopamine at baseline,
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.580]   what we call your sort of tonic as it's called,
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.540]   meaning consistent or ongoing level of dopamine,
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:21.480]   how that dictates whether or not you are going to be better
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.640]   at one particular aspect of the creative process or another,
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.780]   and how you can enhance your creativity
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:29.500]   in the very short term, very quickly,
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.440]   using tools that are known
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.500]   to trigger additional release of dopamine,
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:34.860]   which in some cases is good,
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:37.560]   and in some cases is bad, I should mention.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.720]   And in other words,
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.020]   determine how you feel in one moment
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.400]   should dictate what sort of tool you should use
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.240]   in order to become more creative.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.180]   The relationship between mood and creativity
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:54.760]   is a fascinating one that is bridged by one main feature,
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.800]   which is the amount of dopamine present
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.800]   in this nigrostriatal pathway.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:02.060]   And there's a really wonderful correlate or measure
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:05.040]   of the amount of dopamine that's active in that pathway
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.580]   that can be addressed noninvasively in the laboratory.
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:10.200]   As I mentioned, the nigrostriatal pathway
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:14.100]   is involved in movement and in eye blinking,
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.340]   which of course is a movement.
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:17.380]   It's not a movement of the sort that we typically think of
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:18.260]   when we think of movements,
[01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:20.460]   but nonetheless, it relies on dopamine levels
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:21.300]   in this pathway.
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:24.220]   And in fact, we can state very confidently
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:26.980]   that when dopamine levels are elevated,
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:29.340]   the blinking reflex is more active.
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:30.360]   People just blink more.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:33.160]   When dopamine levels are lower or less active
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.540]   in this pathway, people tend to blink less.
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.780]   So blink frequency is a common measure
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:42.100]   in studies of dopamine within this pathway
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:44.180]   that relate to creativity.
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:45.600]   The work that I'm about to describe
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.660]   is largely the work of two authors
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:50.500]   who have done wonderful work across several papers.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:53.020]   Unfortunately for me, their names are difficult to pronounce,
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:54.600]   so I apologize to them and their relatives
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:58.040]   for what is sure to be incorrect pronunciation.
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.260]   But the last names of these authors
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:02.860]   are Cermahini and Hummel.
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:03.880]   They're in the Netherlands.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:07.380]   So Cermahini and Hummel done a number of different papers
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:09.320]   or studies, rather, of the relationship
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.740]   between blinking, mood, and creativity,
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.780]   in particular, divergent thinking.
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:15.940]   What they found is that if people are blinking
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:18.180]   fairly often and they measure their mood
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:19.340]   through subjective tests,
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:20.940]   and if they were to do brain imaging,
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:22.540]   which other studies have done,
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.640]   they find is that those people can engage
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.660]   in divergent thinking very easily.
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:29.920]   In other words, being in a good mood
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.640]   facilitates divergent thinking.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.200]   Now, some of you might immediately say, well, duh,
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.300]   if you're in a good mood, you can kind of be more playful
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:39.580]   about the exploration, about what could happen
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:42.460]   with these notes of music or these foods, et cetera.
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:44.680]   But it's not so obvious because it turns out
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.960]   that if your dopamine levels are very, very high,
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:50.980]   and this can be measured non-invasively
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:52.160]   through the frequency of blinks,
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.880]   or it can be measured more invasively through brain imaging,
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.100]   even through blood draws or other methods
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:00.680]   to measure dopamine, if dopamine levels are very, very high,
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.420]   what you observe is that divergent thinking
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:04.520]   is actually very, very poor.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:07.980]   Now, a naturally occurring, truly pathological example
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:10.440]   of this would be something like manic bipolar disorder,
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.440]   where somebody is in the manic phase,
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:15.480]   or somebody who has taken methamphetamine or cocaine,
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.740]   what tends to happen is that they have lots and lots
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:21.280]   of ideas, all of those ideas seem really exciting to them,
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.480]   but if you were to talk to them for any given moment,
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.520]   they would be very fixated on one particular tunnel of ideas
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:30.080]   and by being fixated on one particular tunnel of ideas,
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.500]   like the idea that they're going to run
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:34.540]   for president tomorrow, this is unfortunately typical
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:37.360]   of people who have bipolar, which is not to say
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.680]   that everybody who runs for president is bipolar,
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.720]   rather people who are bipolar often have
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.480]   these delusions of grandeur,
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.880]   that they're somehow going to be president
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.040]   simply because they decided to,
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.720]   and that they were selected to do this, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.220]   ideas about themselves and other people
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.600]   that are very constrained, in other words,
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.040]   not very divergent, so divergent thinking is favored
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:01.040]   by having elevated levels of dopamine, but not too high,
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.560]   well, that of course creates a conundrum,
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.680]   how do you know how much dopamine you need
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.040]   and how to achieve those elevated levels of dopamine?
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.280]   Well, leaving aside people who are suffering
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:14.280]   from a manic episode, what Cermahini and Hummel have discovered
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:17.400]   is that if people are in sort of a low mood,
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:20.400]   they're not feeling great, maybe they're depressed,
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.760]   but they're just not feeling that great,
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.600]   they feel, you know, on a scale of one to 10,
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.960]   around a two or a three, maybe a four,
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:29.020]   the probability that they will be able to engage effectively
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:31.560]   in divergent thinking is quite low,
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:36.280]   however, the good news is they are typically very susceptible
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.880]   to elevations in mood through observing
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.480]   or hearing positive stories, listening to music
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:47.200]   that they like, any kind of so-called inspirational stimuli,
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.840]   now this is good news, what this means is that
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.440]   if you're somebody who's not feeling very motivated
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.720]   to engage in divergent thinking,
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.240]   you're not feeling very creative,
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.560]   you're feeling a little low, the thing to do in that case
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.520]   is actually to take external stimuli,
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.000]   things that you know that you like
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.760]   and start interacting with those stimuli
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:06.680]   to get your mood elevated and then to engage
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.120]   in divergent thinking, however,
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.640]   what Cermahini and Hummel have also shown
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:16.640]   is that if people are already in a very good mood,
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:20.320]   elevating dopamine further is not conducive
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.320]   and in fact is detrimental to divergent thinking
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:27.480]   and in that case, they would be better off, for example,
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:31.120]   not engaging in any activities or, you know,
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.300]   taking anything in the way of pharmacology
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.600]   that would further increase their dopamine
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.880]   and probably limiting the amount of external stimuli
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:41.400]   that are coming in through music and visual stimuli
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.560]   and really focusing on divergent thinking
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.840]   in the creative process immediately.
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:48.380]   Now, this is important, in an earlier episode,
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.920]   both on bipolar and on other forms of depression,
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:55.920]   I talked about how rates of bipolar manic episodes
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:00.800]   and dopamine levels and creativity tend to be correlated,
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:04.140]   now, unfortunately, rates of suicide are 20 to 30 times
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:06.560]   higher in people who have bipolar disorder as well
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.440]   and so there's a whole dark side to the bipolar disorder
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:10.780]   that makes it a very, very dangerous
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:13.060]   and important disorder to treat
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:16.560]   but for sake of the discussion of creativity,
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.920]   what this means is that we all need to develop
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.800]   some sort of intuitive sense as to whether or not
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.900]   our mood is, suppose we could bend this
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:27.780]   into three categories, is kind of yes, you know,
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:29.560]   happy, excited, positive mood
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:32.100]   and of course, there are going to be levels to that,
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:36.080]   low, kind of like hmm, or kind of meh, kind of in the middle
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.960]   so if you're in a low mood or kind of meh mood,
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.120]   by all means, engage in something
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.040]   probably for about, you know, five to 30 minutes
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.480]   that elevates your mood
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.400]   before trying to engage in divergent thinking.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.800]   However, if you happen to be in a pretty positive mood,
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.200]   even if you're not 10 out of 10 on mood,
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:54.320]   then bringing in additional stimuli
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.180]   to increase your levels of dopamine will not help you
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:00.180]   and in fact can hurt the divergent thinking process.
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:03.380]   So in that case, I would also encourage you to think about
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:05.500]   something that was discussed on a previous episode
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.820]   which is the particular effects of caffeine.
[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:09.660]   I'll get into caffeine a little bit later
[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:11.500]   but just very briefly,
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:14.660]   caffeine increases levels of dopamine receptors
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:16.100]   so it's not that caffeine is bad,
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:17.740]   in fact, caffeine can be neuroprotective,
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:19.820]   it can enhance focus and so forth
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:22.700]   but divergent thinking is sort of anti-focus,
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:24.740]   it requires just enough focus to be able
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:26.300]   to come up with new ideas
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.700]   but you actually don't want to be overly focused.
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:31.120]   Focus is more conducive to convergent thinking,
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.140]   in fact, that's exactly what the literature shows
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:36.200]   is that caffeine, because its effects on epinephrine
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:38.760]   and related systems in the brain like adenosine
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.820]   but mainly because of its effects on persistence and focus
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:44.860]   is very conducive to convergent thinking.
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:48.140]   So if you're somebody who wants to explore creativity
[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.940]   and wants to get better at creativity,
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:52.480]   you now know that you need to engage in divergent thinking
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:56.020]   and then afterwards, convergent thinking.
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:59.340]   I would recommend not using stimulants such as caffeine
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:02.940]   prior to divergent thinking but rather use stimulants
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:05.500]   if you do want to use stimulants such as caffeine
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.580]   prior to convergent thinking
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:10.440]   and in fact, in formulating the architecture
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:13.320]   of today's episode, which took me many hours
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.500]   across many different days, I confess,
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.180]   I actually decided to try this.
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.460]   In trying to imagine the different configurations
[01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:21.740]   and ways that this information can be organized,
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:23.220]   I deliberately abstained from caffeine
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:24.940]   during those bouts of work
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:27.140]   and when structuring everything
[01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:30.140]   according to the decisions I had already made,
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:33.060]   I purposely ingested caffeine prior to that.
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:36.340]   Now, of course, constructing a podcast episode
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:40.060]   is not really the ultimate example of a creative act
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:42.180]   because of course, it's taking existing information,
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:43.460]   it's arranging it in novel ways
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:46.540]   but it doesn't necessarily allow key concepts to pop out
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:49.460]   in the way that for instance, Banksy or a Rothko
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:51.260]   or an Escher would pop out, okay?
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:53.940]   I'm certainly not naive in thinking that it does
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:57.460]   but the principle is what's important here.
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:59.760]   You need divergent thinking, you need convergent thinking,
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:02.180]   you need some level of elevated dopamine
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:05.140]   in order to engage in divergent thinking
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:08.020]   but not so high that it starts to inhibit that process.
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:09.940]   Now, if you were to come into the laboratory,
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:12.660]   this could be measured by your frequency of blinking.
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:13.500]   For better or for worse,
[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.900]   we can't actually count the number of times that we blink
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:17.620]   unless we're actively paying attention to it.
[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:18.820]   So I don't recommend that you pay attention
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:20.580]   to your blinking because that will take you off course
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:22.700]   from all the other important things of your life
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.340]   and how many times you're blinking
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:27.780]   is rarely an important thing for you to pay attention to.
[01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:30.740]   You can however, learn to calibrate your mood,
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:32.980]   that is to assess your mood,
[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:35.980]   whether or not you're in low, medium or high mood,
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:38.620]   no problem using that broad binning, right?
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:39.980]   You could scale it on one to 10
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:41.740]   and then decide whether or not you're going to use
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:44.240]   some dopamine elevating stimulus from the outside.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.860]   Again, it could be music, could be exercise
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.420]   is an excellent way to elevate dopamine.
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.420]   I'll talk about another well-established one
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:52.120]   from the research literature
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:56.500]   that is known to elevate dopamine by 65%
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:57.940]   in the particular pathway
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:00.220]   that's relevant for divergent thinking
[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:02.120]   and to do that without any pharmacology.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.620]   I'll share that with you in a moment,
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:06.940]   but you need to decide for you in a given moment
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:09.720]   or in a given work attempt at creativity,
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.720]   what you need and apply accordingly
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:15.640]   because as Cheremini and Hummel have shown,
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.860]   whether or not you are in a low mood, medium mood
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:20.080]   or high mood really can determine
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.100]   whether or not you'll be able to access
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:23.660]   divergent thinking or not.
[01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:26.380]   Now, if you're somebody who already has an idea in mind,
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:28.220]   you're very excited about a creative idea
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:30.680]   and you want to hone it, you want to shape it,
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:32.160]   you want to pressure test it.
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.820]   We'll talk a little bit more about what that means
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:36.120]   in a three-step process in just a little bit.
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:41.140]   I would strongly encourage you to look at that process
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.780]   as a very linear process
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:45.180]   in which there are right and wrong answers.
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:48.540]   And there the use of caffeine at appropriate dosages
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:50.740]   and dosages for caffeine that are safe
[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:52.240]   and in fact performance enhancing
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.740]   were covered in the episode on caffeine.
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:56.040]   Turns out it's one to three milligrams
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.440]   per kilogram of body weight, by the way.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.860]   And if you want to leverage caffeine
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:04.620]   or maybe even other forms of healthy legal stimulants,
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:06.620]   those are covered in the caffeine episode
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:08.480]   and I'll talk about a few more a little bit later.
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:09.780]   So to summarize this segment
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:11.560]   and also just to make a more general point,
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.020]   I think it's very useful for people
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:16.480]   to start to pay attention to what their tonic level,
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:19.040]   that is their baseline level of dopamine,
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:22.560]   ought to be in this nigrostriatal circuit
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:23.560]   and in other circuits.
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:26.100]   And to do that by learning to assess one's mood
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:28.960]   and pay attention to what kind of mood they happen to be in
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:31.240]   and then to leverage tools, behavioral tools,
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.360]   maybe pharmacologic tools,
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.200]   provided they're safe and they're legal
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:36.580]   in order to either increase dopamine
[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:39.080]   or to elect not to increase dopamine
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.360]   in order to access the creative process.
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.060]   Now I've mentioned pharmacology a few times
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:44.760]   and I'd like to talk about that just a little bit more
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.800]   in the context of dopamine.
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:50.880]   First of all, there is no supplement or drug
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.000]   that you or anyone else can take
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.700]   that will selectively elevate dopamine
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:24:00.520]   in only one of the four circuits that I described before.
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:03.220]   Okay, this is just the state of the technology nowadays.
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:04.420]   If you take a pill
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:06.360]   or even if you were to inject some substance,
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:10.420]   again, I hope this would be legal and safe, et cetera,
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.080]   whatever mode of delivery,
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:15.280]   there is no technology that exists at this time
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:18.400]   that would allow you to selectively amplify dopamine,
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:21.300]   for instance, just in the nigrostriatal pathway
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.200]   or just in the mesocortical pathway.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.420]   Again, the nigrostriatal pathway
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:26.360]   associated with divergent thinking,
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.880]   the mesocortical pathway associated
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.860]   with cognitive persistence and convergent thinking.
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:34.760]   If you were to amplify dopamine levels, for instance,
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:37.880]   by taking the amino acid precursor to dopamine L-tyrosine,
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:40.560]   something that I occasionally do to enhance dopamine levels
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.080]   for sake of work or energy,
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:43.920]   500 milligrams or a thousand milligrams,
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.040]   even a L-tyrosine,
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.680]   sometimes I'll combine that with other things like alpha-GPC,
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.600]   it's going to enhance dopamine transmission
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:53.420]   in the nigrostriatal pathway, the mesocortical pathway,
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:55.160]   but also in the mesolimbic pathway,
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.400]   and also for that matter,
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:58.360]   in the tuberoinframedibular pathway
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.640]   associated with the pituitary.
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.080]   There is no way to direct dopamine activation
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.240]   to just one of those pathways.
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:08.180]   That's just a reflection of the existing technology.
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:09.420]   Now, this is also true
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:12.900]   if you rely on illicit drugs to increase dopamine.
[01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:14.420]   So if it's cocaine or methamphetamine,
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:16.940]   those will greatly increase dopamine,
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:20.620]   but non-selectively across all those different pathways.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:24.120]   And likewise with any drugs that inhibit or block
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.640]   or antagonize, as it's called, dopamine.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.800]   This is why people who, for instance,
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.800]   have schizophrenia and take drugs
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.120]   to suppress auditory hallucinations,
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:35.400]   some of those drugs work
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.520]   because they block the so-called D2 receptor
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:38.400]   of the dopamine pathway.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:40.760]   D2 receptors are present in all four
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.540]   of the dopaminergic pathways in the brain.
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:45.440]   And oftentimes those drugs will in fact
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.120]   suppress psychotic symptoms, auditory hallucinations, et cetera
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.740]   because they reduce dopamine.
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:52.240]   But those people oftentimes will have problems
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:53.080]   with movement.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.560]   They will express what's called
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:57.320]   in the clinical literature, tardive dyskinesia,
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:00.020]   kind of writhing of the face and the body
[01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:02.360]   from suppression of dopamine
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.060]   within the nigrostriatal pathway,
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:05.200]   which is associated with movement.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.760]   They will sometimes have deficits in eye blinking.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:11.000]   People with Parkinson's who actually have selective deficits
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.800]   of dopamine within the substantia nigra,
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.240]   nigrostriatal, remember, substantia nigra,
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:17.520]   show deficits in what?
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.360]   In movement, in the smoothness of movement.
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.240]   Oftentimes they won't blink at all.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.960]   They'll have kind of a blank stare
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:24.720]   and they have other issues as well.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:26.960]   So if you're somebody who's interested
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:28.920]   in increasing dopamine through the use
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:31.440]   of legal safe pharmacology,
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.960]   as I would hope it would be the case,
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:36.040]   there are ways to do that reasonably safely
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:36.880]   for most people.
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:38.200]   And people with bipolar disorder,
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.880]   issues with the dopaminergic pathway should not do this.
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:43.280]   I know nowadays there's a lot of use
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:46.000]   of drugs that increase dopamine,
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.000]   such as Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil, R-modafinil,
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.200]   often prescribed for things like
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.920]   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.840]   We did an entire episode on ADHD
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:59.280]   and pharmacologic prescription supplement
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.360]   and behavioral nutritional tools for ADHD.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.800]   You can find that episode at hubermanlab.com.
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:06.100]   I know a number of people take those compounds
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:08.680]   in order to increase dopamine and focus
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:12.160]   for sake of studying or other activities,
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.080]   staying up long hours, et cetera.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.920]   And the fact that they increase focus,
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.860]   they are effective although they do have their side effects,
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:21.040]   sometimes severe, sometimes habit forming,
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.960]   sometimes even addicting as well.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.400]   But the fact that they increase focus
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.420]   should automatically tell you something,
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:30.840]   that those drugs in particular increase dopamine
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:35.840]   in the so-called mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways.
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.120]   Why can I say that?
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.140]   How can I say that with any degree of confidence?
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:40.560]   Well, there are these four pathways,
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.660]   one's involved in movement,
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:45.300]   but these other ones are involved in motivation
[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:47.140]   and desire and reward.
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:48.960]   And I told you that these things can be habit forming
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.180]   and addicting in some cases,
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:52.860]   and they can greatly increase focus
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:56.740]   and focus is supported by enhanced levels of dopamine
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:00.680]   within this mesolimbic and mesocortical pathway.
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:03.460]   So yes, those drugs increase dopamine across the board,
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:05.900]   but there does seem to be some weighting of dopamine
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:08.600]   toward the systems involved in motivation and reward,
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:11.220]   and sometimes even leading to habit formation and addiction.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:14.440]   That's why those drugs should only be taken
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:19.000]   with the close supervision of a very skilled psychiatrist
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.720]   or somebody else who's board certified
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.120]   who can really govern that.
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:26.040]   There are, however, ways to increase dopamine
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:27.680]   more evenly across the board
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.220]   using non-prescription approaches.
[01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:32.120]   And one I already mentioned, which is L-tyrosine,
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.160]   taken typically in dosages of 500 to 1,000 milligrams.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:38.300]   L-tyrosine is not as potent in increasing dopamine
[01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:42.520]   as are the prescriptions drugs that I referred to before,
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.440]   tends to be milder.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.920]   For some people, it can have a very amplified effect.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:46.840]   They feel it right away.
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:50.440]   It's very intense in elevating focus and motivation
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.440]   and the desire to move.
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:55.040]   For other people, it's less potent.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.700]   It really depends on a number of things.
[01:28:56.700 --> 01:28:59.480]   I should mention that regular consumption of caffeine
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:02.520]   of one to three milligrams per kilogram body weight per day
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:06.600]   also will increase dopamine receptor efficacy and density,
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:09.920]   which will make any existing dopamine more effective,
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.880]   whether or not that dopamine is triggered
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.920]   by things like L-tyrosine,
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:15.640]   or if you're not taking anything to elevate dopamine,
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:18.000]   the dopamine that you do make will be more effective
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.640]   in elevating your mood, motivation, and desire to move,
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.080]   and by extension, divergent thinking
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:26.360]   if you are consuming caffeine.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.920]   But again, caffeine should be taken
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:29.640]   prior to convergent thinking type task,
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.360]   probably more than it should be taken
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:33.380]   prior to divergent thinking task.
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:35.640]   And of course, there are other legal supplements
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.040]   that can elevate dopamine as well.
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.360]   In particular, phenylethylamine is very effective
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.180]   in doing that.
[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:43.020]   600 milligrams of that has a brief effect,
[01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:45.080]   lasting only about 30 to 45 minutes,
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.880]   but it is one that many people find beneficial
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.360]   for sake of studying or for creative thinking
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:50.600]   and so on and so forth.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:51.880]   Now that's pharmacology.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.720]   And in fact, there's an extensive landscape of prescription
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:57.940]   and supplement-based pharmacology and indeed nutrition.
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:59.740]   For instance, the consumption of foods
[01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:01.240]   that are high in L-tyrosine,
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:04.280]   such as aged Parmesan cheese, for instance, of all things,
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:05.720]   very, very high in L-tyrosine,
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:08.040]   the precursor to dopamine, certain foods.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.000]   You can look up online
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.360]   which foods contain high levels of L-tyrosine
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.740]   and which ones are compatible with your nutrition.
[01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:16.680]   But leaving pharmacology aside,
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:20.500]   there's a very exciting non-pharmacological tool,
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:22.280]   a purely behavioral tool,
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:24.880]   that the research literature has told us
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:27.980]   can selectively increase dopamine
[01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:30.680]   within the nigrostriatal pathway,
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:33.160]   the pathway that's involved in divergent thinking,
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.080]   and can do so very dramatically,
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.880]   as much as 65% above baseline.
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:39.940]   And so this is a behavioral tool
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:42.100]   that is useful for a number of things,
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:44.540]   but that I find particularly interesting
[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:46.600]   in leveraging towards the exploration
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:48.040]   and enhancement of creativity,
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.880]   because first of all, it's purely behavioral.
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:51.760]   So it's zero cost.
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:56.660]   And it involves no manipulation of brain neuromodulators
[01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:58.480]   or chemistry through pharmacology.
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:01.080]   So it's something that you can explore very safely
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.320]   and certainly not having to purchase anything.
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:06.520]   And what's really remarkable is the selectivity,
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:09.480]   or I think it's fair to say the immense selectivity
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.880]   that this particular behavioral intervention
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:15.280]   seems to exert on dopamine within this pathway
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.240]   associated with divergent thinking.
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:18.920]   So the study that I'm about to describe
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:21.520]   is a study that dates back 20 years.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:22.720]   Now that should not concern you.
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:26.600]   In fact, the early arrival of this study,
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:28.460]   or what now seems to be early arrival,
[01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:30.680]   I mean, it wasn't that long ago,
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:33.720]   is really exciting because the first line of this study
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:36.080]   really illustrates how important
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.400]   or how much of a landmark study this really is.
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.280]   And so I'll just read you the first line of the study,
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:41.220]   then I'll tell you the title,
[01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:43.320]   then I'll tell you what they discovered
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:45.120]   in fairly top contour,
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:46.520]   and we will provide a link to the study
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:49.060]   if you want to peruse it in more detail.
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:50.660]   The first line of the study is,
[01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:53.720]   this is the first in vivo, just meaning in the organism,
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:56.080]   in this case, this was a study on humans.
[01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:59.080]   This is the first in vivo demonstration of an association
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:02.480]   between an endogenous neurotransmitter release,
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:05.840]   endogenous means within us, and conscious experience.
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:07.220]   So what this sentence essentially says
[01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:08.900]   is this is the first study exploring
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:11.380]   how a chemical that's naturally released in our body
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:16.080]   relates to a particular quality of conscious experience.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:18.640]   This study was performed in Scandinavia,
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.940]   in one of the hospitals in Denmark.
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:21.980]   Again, we'll provide a link.
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:23.500]   The first author is Keher,
[01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:24.780]   I think I'm pronouncing it correctly,
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:29.100]   although probably not K-J-A-E-R, at all.
[01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:31.720]   And the title of the study is increased dopamine tone
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:34.240]   during meditation-induced change of consciousness.
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.120]   And I want to just highlight that the meditation
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:38.500]   used in this study isn't really a meditation at all.
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:40.840]   I don't know why they selected that for the title.
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:43.220]   The behavioral protocol used in this study
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:46.840]   was more akin to what is normally called yoga nidra,
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:49.380]   or NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
[01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:51.520]   Now, yoga nidra and NSDR have been discussed
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:53.660]   many times before on this podcast.
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:55.300]   Yoga nidra, for instance, is a practice
[01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:57.460]   that's been around for hundreds, if not thousands of years,
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:00.240]   in which people deliberately lie still.
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:03.380]   So they're forcing themselves to be mostly motionless.
[01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:05.260]   Small movements are fine.
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:06.740]   And they're directing their attention
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:07.840]   to the surface of their body.
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.140]   They're doing long exhale breathing,
[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:12.580]   sometimes some intentions, sometimes some visualization,
[01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:15.220]   but it's really self-directed relaxation.
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:18.420]   And the key component is that people stay awake
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:20.940]   and engage in very little movement.
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:22.680]   And the key word there is movement.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:26.340]   Now, non-sleep deep rest is a acronym,
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:27.540]   a term that I coined.
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:30.140]   It's not a term that I coined in order to try
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:32.700]   and wipe away or discard with yoga nidra.
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.700]   I'm a person who has great respect
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:37.100]   for yoga nidra and its traditions.
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:40.560]   It's a term that I coined in order to encompass
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.620]   a number of practices that don't include
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:46.080]   any mystical type language or scientific language
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:46.920]   for that matter.
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.580]   And that doesn't involve intentions.
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:50.500]   It involves deep relaxation,
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:52.940]   yet remaining wide awake and conscious.
[01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:54.980]   Sometimes people fall asleep and that's okay.
[01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:57.500]   But this is really an atypical brain state
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:02.500]   of being deeply relaxed, yet in general awake and motionless.
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:05.540]   Again, motionless being the key.
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:08.400]   Very few brain states involve us being mostly,
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:11.020]   if not completely motionless and yet awake.
[01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:12.300]   And it turns out that brain state,
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:14.740]   whether or not you call it yoga nidra, you call it NSDR,
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:17.540]   whether or not you call it meditation-induced shift
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:20.220]   in consciousness as they did in this study,
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:22.300]   although they do refer to yoga nidra,
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:23.520]   all refer to the same thing,
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:27.620]   which is being motionless and yet aware
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.680]   and relaxed, I should mention.
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.540]   So in this study,
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:34.020]   what they did was they brought subjects into the laboratory.
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:36.780]   They had them either undergo
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.940]   this self-directed deep relaxation
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:41.820]   while they are motionless or mostly motionless,
[01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:45.100]   or they had them listen to an audio script
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:47.300]   while also just lying there with eyes closed.
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:50.020]   And then they used a number of chemical tricks.
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:51.380]   And I don't want to get too deep into those now
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:52.720]   'cause they can be a little bit distracting.
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:53.740]   For those of you that are interested,
[01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:54.740]   you can look at it in the study.
[01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:57.660]   This is a binding of a chemical in the brain
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:59.180]   that then they can image with brain imaging,
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:00.380]   which is what they did in the study,
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:04.100]   to evaluate how much dopamine changed in the brain
[01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:06.300]   and where specifically in the brain dopamine
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:09.500]   changed its levels before, during, and after
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.920]   this particular behavioral practice
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.140]   in one or the other group.
[01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:15.620]   And what they discovered is that
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:17.980]   people who did this deep relaxation,
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:21.180]   that is self-directed deep relaxation,
[01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:22.640]   lying there, eyes closed,
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:26.240]   relatively motionless,
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:27.860]   although small movements of the body
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:30.600]   or movements of the head are absolutely fine.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:35.460]   What they observed was a 65% increase in dopamine release.
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:38.220]   Now here it's key, dopamine release.
[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:41.440]   And they observed an increase in so-called theta activity.
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:44.880]   Theta activity is a pattern of brainwave activity
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:47.820]   that's commonly associated with creative states
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:51.280]   and divergent thinking in particular, so that's important.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.700]   And they observed that across subjects,
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:55.980]   specifically in the nigrostriatal pathway,
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:58.460]   this pathway associated with divergent thinking.
[01:35:58.460 --> 01:35:59.680]   So this is very exciting.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.640]   This is a study that really points to a behavioral tool
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:05.160]   that can be used to selectively elevate dopamine
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:08.100]   in the very pathway that one would want to
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:09.980]   if they wanted to engage divergent thinking
[01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:12.200]   for sake of creative exploration.
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:14.040]   There are also a number of key observations
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:15.720]   within this study.
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:20.720]   First of all, the reduction in bodily movement was essential.
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:23.520]   In fact, when people rated
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:28.380]   or when the amount of readiness for action in their system,
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:30.340]   their body, was evaluated,
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:33.480]   what people found was that immediately after this practice,
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:34.940]   they felt very still.
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:38.160]   In other words, they felt as if remaining still was natural.
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:39.720]   Now, it's not the case that they couldn't move.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:42.280]   In fact, the elevation in dopamine that occurred
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:44.120]   during this practice,
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:48.500]   this yoga nidra-like non-sleep or NSDR-like practice,
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:51.120]   actually prepared them to be able to move
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:55.000]   in a much more dedicated and robust way afterwards.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:55.960]   But during the practice,
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:57.700]   their readiness for action went way, way down.
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:00.340]   Not surprising, they were pretty much motionless.
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:01.580]   But interestingly,
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:05.120]   as the level of readiness for movement
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:06.960]   went down, down, down, down, down,
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:09.160]   their degree of visual imagery,
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.520]   that is their internal landscape
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:15.640]   and their ability to imagine new things, increased.
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:17.400]   And in fact, areas of the brain
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:19.080]   that are associated with visual imagery,
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:22.180]   such as the visual or so-called occipital cortex
[01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:25.000]   and the parietal cortex has been shown in other studies
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000]   to ramp up when people are motionless.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.840]   So there seems to be this inverse relationship
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:31.700]   between movement and visual imagery, which makes sense.
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:32.540]   When we're moving,
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:34.720]   we can pay attention to things in the outside world.
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:36.740]   We tend to be aware of our sensory environment
[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:38.300]   to varying degrees,
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:39.940]   but we don't tend to be very focused
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:41.400]   on visual imagery within our head.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:44.060]   Whereas when we lie down or sit down and close our eyes
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:45.140]   and we are motionless,
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:48.080]   the degree of visual imagery really increases.
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:50.460]   Hence the increase in divergent thinking
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:52.060]   because what essentially is happening
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.420]   is the library of options,
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:56.760]   the library of possible interactions
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:58.340]   with whatever it is that you're thinking about.
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:37:59.180]   I gave the example,
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:01.360]   which is a trivial one on purpose of a pen,
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:04.780]   but the bank of options that becomes available
[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:05.960]   when we are motionless
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:08.660]   and when we are limiting our visualization
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:12.240]   of the external world increases exponentially.
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:13.120]   So this is important.
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:16.060]   And what it points to is the fact that this very simple,
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:18.840]   completely non-pharmacologic behavioral practice
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.980]   of lying down motionless for some period of time.
[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:22.500]   And I confess the amount of time
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:24.880]   that they use in this study was quite long.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:27.000]   It was longer than 60 minutes,
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.240]   but all the data that I'm aware of
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:31.160]   in terms of NSDR and yoga nidra,
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.800]   and there's a growing body of literature
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.160]   on these practices I should mention,
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.780]   show that even 10 minutes,
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:40.240]   or even better would be 20 or 30 minutes
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:43.120]   of lying motionless with eyes closed
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:47.040]   and allowing the mind to drift wherever it happens to go,
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:51.760]   but focusing on relaxing by doing long exhale breathing,
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.060]   perhaps doing a body scan
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.800]   of focusing your attention on particular body parts,
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:58.440]   but not keeping it focused on any one particular body part
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:38:59.540]   for that long.
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:02.420]   That general practice of deep relaxation while awake
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:04.320]   and being relatively motionless
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.560]   really favors the brain states
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:07.880]   associated with divergent thinking
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:10.680]   and actually represents an accessing
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:12.200]   of the various components
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:15.040]   that you would use during divergent thinking.
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:17.160]   And perhaps most excitingly,
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.280]   it's associated with this massive increase,
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:23.180]   65% increase in dopamine release within the very pathway
[01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:25.200]   that underlies divergent thinking.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:27.100]   So my recommendation would be for those of you
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:28.900]   that are trying to enhance divergent thinking
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:30.280]   and creative ability,
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:34.380]   that you would do this practice at a minimum once per week.
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:36.400]   And I should say, if you were going to do it once per week,
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:39.040]   I'd recommend doing it for about 20 to 30 minutes.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.240]   Some of you might be able to do it
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:42.000]   for as long as 60 minutes.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.520]   I myself do such a practice on a daily basis,
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:46.760]   anywhere from 10 minutes to 20 minutes,
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:48.580]   sometimes 30 minutes.
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:52.560]   There's an example of an NSDR script completely zero cost.
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.700]   I confess it does happen to be my voice.
[01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:56.440]   So forgive me in advance.
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:57.940]   There are other options of NSDR.
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:40:00.780]   You can go to YouTube, put NSDR and my name.
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:02.080]   Again, completely zero cost.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:05.720]   You can get a sample of what a 10 minute NSDR script
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.300]   looks like, that's through Virtusan, put that out there.
[01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:11.100]   So thank you Virtusan for putting that out there
[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:12.360]   at zero cost.
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:16.200]   There are examples of 20 and 30 minute NSDR scripts
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.400]   and yoga nidra scripts.
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:18.660]   Some that I particularly like,
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:20.760]   we will also provide a link to some of those.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:23.720]   Again, those are completely zero cost for you to explore.
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:25.060]   But more important than you follow
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.740]   any one particular yoga nidra NSDR script
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:30.080]   is that you learn to take your body and brain
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:34.000]   into these states of limited motion,
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.740]   elevated dopamine within this particular pathway,
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:38.220]   and fairly deep relaxation.
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:39.860]   Again, if you happen to fall asleep,
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:42.060]   that's not necessarily a bad thing.
[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.260]   Although the idea is that you stay
[01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:46.400]   in a shallow plane of consciousness or sleep,
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.080]   hence the term non-sleep deep rest.
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:51.840]   So in any event, I think this is a very useful practice
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.160]   that many people could benefit from.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.500]   And the fact that it's zero cost and purely behavioral,
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:58.020]   I think adds additional benefit
[01:40:58.020 --> 01:40:59.940]   because it's certainly one that people could explore
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:02.940]   depending on what amount of time you're willing to commit.
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:05.720]   And the research data on this now extend
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:07.420]   beyond this one individual paper.
[01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:10.460]   And I think is really exciting because what it says is,
[01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:12.960]   as the title and first line of the paper suggests,
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:16.280]   is that we can increase dopamine using specific types
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.220]   of meditation induced consciousness.
[01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:21.100]   And those increases in dopamine can be used
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:23.340]   to increase our ability to be more creative.
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:26.360]   Before moving forward, I want to make absolutely clear
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:30.200]   how it is that you would use NSDR aka yoga nidra
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.980]   or similar, the name doesn't really matter after all,
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:34.800]   the practice is what matters,
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:39.320]   in order to enhance dopamine in this nigrostriatal pathway
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:40.940]   and enhance divergent thinking.
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:43.740]   The key thing to understand here is that
[01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:48.740]   the period of motionlessness and deep relaxation while awake
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.100]   increases dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway,
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:54.520]   it increases mental imagery.
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:58.980]   That is, it increases access to the bank or the library,
[01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:03.320]   if you will, of possible solutions or elements to engage
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:05.460]   in the divergent thinking process.
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:08.340]   But divergent thinking itself does not occur
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:11.500]   during NSDR aka yoga nidra.
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:15.980]   The NSDR and yoga nidra, deep relaxation, meditation,
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:17.860]   whatever it is you want to call it,
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:19.880]   sets a dopaminergic tone,
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:21.700]   and that's actually the appropriate use of the word,
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:22.800]   dopaminergic tone.
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:25.540]   It raises the baseline of dopamine transmission
[01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:28.900]   in that circuitry that then positions you
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:31.840]   to engage in divergent thinking more effectively.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:34.960]   So the idea would be to do anywhere from 10 to 20,
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.200]   maybe 30 minutes, maybe even as much as an hour,
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:39.240]   depending on how much time you had to dedicate
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:42.060]   of such a meditation NSDR practice.
[01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:44.720]   And then, not necessarily immediately,
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:48.300]   but within the five to 15 minutes following,
[01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:51.500]   then to go into a practice of divergent thinking
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:53.460]   and start doing creative exploration.
[01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:55.500]   That is, to start thinking about different ways
[01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:58.420]   to combine existing elements in whatever domain it is
[01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:00.440]   that you want to achieve creativity.
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.980]   So the point is that the divergent thinking itself
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:07.580]   is not occurring during the NSDR or yoga nidra practice.
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:09.200]   The NSDR and yoga nidra practice
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:11.120]   prepares you for divergent thinking
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:14.060]   that you do in the hour or hours that follows.
[01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:16.680]   And just to contrast that with pharmacology,
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:20.960]   I am not aware of any specific dopamine-related pharmacology
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:23.540]   that would allow us to selectively increase dopamine
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:24.620]   in the very pathway
[01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:27.700]   associated with divergent thinking and creativity.
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:29.640]   Now, there are forms of pharmacology
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:32.780]   that can shift brain neurotransmitters and neuromodulators
[01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:34.620]   in ways that favor creativity.
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:36.660]   And this is certainly a topic that we will go into
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:38.740]   in more depth in a future episode,
[01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:39.960]   but there's an exciting study
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:41.900]   that was performed just this last year
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:45.980]   looking at the role of serotonin, another neuromodulator,
[01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:48.100]   in divergent and convergent thinking.
[01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:50.940]   And it turns out that serotonin
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:53.440]   underlies a lot of the brain activity
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:55.700]   that's responsible for both divergent
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:57.540]   and for convergent thinking.
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:00.620]   And there's one particular form of pharmacology
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:04.000]   which can enhance activation of the serotonergic pathways
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.840]   associated with the so-called 5-HT,
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:09.820]   that's serotonin, 5-HT, that's the abbreviation,
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:14.500]   5-HT2A receptor, serotonin 2A receptor,
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:16.040]   in particular brain areas
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:19.180]   in ways that favor both divergent and convergent thinking.
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:21.940]   And the pharmacologic agent in that case
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:24.080]   turns out to be very low dose,
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:26.660]   or as some of you may have heard of it referred to
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:29.700]   as microdosing of psilocybin.
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:30.540]   Now, I do want to say,
[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:32.100]   because it would be entirely inappropriate
[01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:33.720]   for me to not say this,
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:35.960]   that in most areas of the world,
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:37.260]   and in particular in the United States,
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:39.180]   psilocybin is still illegal.
[01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:40.380]   It is not legal.
[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:43.100]   In some areas, it has been decriminalized.
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:45.600]   And there are a number of different clinical trials
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.200]   occurring now at Johns Hopkins, at Stanford,
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:50.220]   at University of California, San Francisco,
[01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:52.200]   and elsewhere exploring psilocybin
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:54.860]   for the treatment of depression, for trauma,
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:56.640]   for eating disorders.
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:00.180]   Most of those studies focus on macro doses of psilocybin,
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:01.260]   not microdosing.
[01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:03.780]   There are far fewer studies of microdosing of psilocybin.
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:07.220]   And I do have to point out that psilocybin use
[01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:10.180]   and possession and of course, sale is still illegal.
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:12.700]   So I would be remiss if I didn't state that.
[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:15.120]   However, I will provide a link to the study
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:17.660]   that shows that microdosing of psilocybin
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:20.420]   for a series of weeks on a daily basis.
[01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:21.980]   So these are dosages of psilocybin
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:24.060]   that do not induce hallucination
[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:29.060]   and do not massively shift mood or internal states
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:32.360]   in any way that has people feeling like they are acting
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:33.760]   or feeling that much different,
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:36.460]   although some people do report a subjective shift,
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:40.200]   does seem to increase divergent thinking ability.
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.900]   But I do want to put a big asterisk,
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:45.540]   a highlight and an underlying pen
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:46.960]   beneath the statement I'm about to make,
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:50.420]   which is that pharmacology of the serotonin system,
[01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:53.560]   just as pharmacology of the dopamine system
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:56.160]   is very broadband, it's a shotgun approach.
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:57.940]   You're going to hit all the circuits of the brain
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:00.940]   that involves serotonin with microdosing psilocybin.
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:04.260]   Although it has some selectivity for the 5-HT2A receptor,
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:08.280]   it can attach to other receptors as well and act there.
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:09.820]   This is the same reason why SSRI,
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:11.940]   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:14.220]   can indeed shift mood and appetite,
[01:46:14.220 --> 01:46:16.680]   but it can also shift libido and other things.
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:19.460]   It's because there are serotonin receptors everywhere,
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:21.300]   or I should say many places,
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:23.140]   not just in the areas of the brain
[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:25.580]   that are associated with mood, for instance.
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:28.180]   And as I mentioned before,
[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:30.940]   agents, whether or not they are recreational
[01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:34.980]   or illicit drugs or prescription drugs or supplements
[01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:37.240]   that increased dopamine will also be broadband
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:39.980]   and hit a number of different circuits in parallel.
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:42.580]   So this is why I always say
[01:46:42.580 --> 01:46:45.220]   behavioral tools really should come first.
[01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:47.540]   I don't say that because I dislike pharmacology.
[01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:48.680]   I say that because in many cases,
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:52.020]   behavioral tools are not only safer and easier to titrate,
[01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:55.300]   to adjust the duration, et cetera, than is pharmacology,
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:57.620]   but also because they can sometimes,
[01:46:57.620 --> 01:46:59.300]   as in the case of the study we just described,
[01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:03.340]   afford you more specificity, not less, than pharmacology.
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:06.620]   Pharmacology has its place, can be wonderful,
[01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:08.540]   provided it's safe and legal, et cetera,
[01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:12.220]   but it can cause a lot of so-called off-target effects.
[01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:13.420]   So for those of you that are interested
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:16.520]   in increasing creativity through pharmacology,
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:19.220]   I would say stay tuned for the data
[01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:21.860]   on psilocybin and microdosing psilocybin.
[01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:25.180]   If you are absolutely obsessed with the idea
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:27.700]   of microdosing psilocybin for enhancing creativity
[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:29.600]   and you'd like to go straight to the study,
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:30.940]   I will tell you what that study is,
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:33.600]   and therefore you can access some of the specifics
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.540]   in terms of dosaging and protocols, et cetera.
[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:36.660]   So since I can't help myself,
[01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:38.500]   I'll just very briefly summarize
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:41.160]   that microdosing psychedelic study.
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:44.340]   The title of the study, which was published in 2018,
[01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:46.540]   is "Exploring the Effect of Microdosing Psychedelics
[01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:50.260]   on Creativity in an Open-Label Natural Setting."
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:51.220]   Interesting title.
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:53.020]   This was a microdosing event
[01:47:53.020 --> 01:47:55.680]   organized by the Dutch Psychedelic Society.
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:58.380]   They examined the effects of psychedelic truffles,
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:02.040]   where they knew what sorts of psychedelic compounds
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:02.880]   were contained there
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.120]   on two creativity-related problem-solving tasks,
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:07.680]   the picture concept task,
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:10.040]   which I don't expect you to recognize or know,
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:11.760]   but it assesses convergent thinking
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:14.240]   and the alternative uses task,
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:15.680]   which I also don't expect you to know,
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:18.760]   but is a standard task for assessing divergent thinking.
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:21.160]   They tested once before taking a microdose,
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:23.880]   and while the effects were expected to be manifested,
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:25.240]   they say, oh, interesting.
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:27.640]   They use the word manifested in a study of psychedelics.
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:30.380]   Science is changing indeed.
[01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:34.560]   In any case, what they found was an enhancement
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:39.340]   of creative, that is, divergent and convergent thinking.
[01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:41.000]   Not surprising, given the fact
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000]   that the 5-HT2A receptor activity is increased
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.440]   by microdosing of psilocybin,
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:51.440]   and 5-HT2A receptors are present
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:52.420]   both on the neural circuits
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:55.520]   to underlie divergent and convergent thinking.
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:49:00.340]   So again, this is not a plug for microdosing psilocybin.
[01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:02.300]   This is really in response
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:03.840]   to what I know will be a number of different questions
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:05.780]   about what sorts of pharmacologic agents
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:07.960]   can be used to increase creativity.
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:10.400]   So more on that later, and again, we'll provide a link
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:13.900]   if you want to read that study in more depth.
[01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:15.240]   I can imagine that a number of you
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:17.940]   are probably also wondering about the effects of alcohol
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:19.620]   and the effects of cannabis on creativity.
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:22.860]   We did a long, in-depth episode all about alcohol
[01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:24.840]   and its effects on health.
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:28.020]   The bottom line on alcohol is that in excess
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:30.040]   of two drinks per week, you're starting to run
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:33.560]   into the cancer-promoting and toxic effects of alcohol.
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:36.520]   I didn't choose for the answer to be that,
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:39.440]   but that's what the data tell us.
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:41.800]   Not telling you you can't drink more than two drinks
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:43.440]   per week, I'm just saying that if you're going to do that,
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:45.960]   you should really consider offsetting that
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.640]   with some other behavioral measures,
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:49.460]   all discussed in the episode on alcohol,
[01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:53.620]   and despite what people think, there is absolutely zero,
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:57.280]   zero evidence that alcohol increases creativity.
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:00.500]   However, by way of reducing activation
[01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:03.240]   of the prefrontal cortex, there is some evidence
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:06.200]   that alcohol and other substances that reduce
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:08.600]   what is called autobiographical scripting,
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:13.600]   that is a narrative about ourselves as our self-awareness,
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:17.520]   that it can enhance divergent thinking at very low doses.
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:19.580]   And this makes sense, divergent thinking involves
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:22.700]   remembering certain things that we can use as elements
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:25.300]   in the creative process, but suppressing narratives
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:27.420]   about what the use of those would mean.
[01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:28.340]   Will people like it?
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:29.180]   Will they not like it?
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:30.520]   Will it lead to the outcome we want?
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:31.360]   Will it won't?
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:34.260]   All of that autobiographical scripting involves
[01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:36.100]   the forebrain being very, very active
[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:38.940]   in specific regions of the forebrain in particular,
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:41.560]   and that all needs to be suppressed,
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:44.480]   which alcohol in very low doses can accomplish.
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:46.060]   But again, that's not a plug for alcohol.
[01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:48.600]   I think behavioral tools would be a much better route,
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:51.220]   but it therefore shouldn't be surprising
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:53.240]   why some people have used low dose alcohol
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:55.480]   in order to engage in the creative process,
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:58.040]   because it involves less inhibition or sense of self
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:01.040]   that could be detrimental to the divergent thinking process.
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:04.180]   Now, with respect to cannabis, I went in depth
[01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:08.240]   into the biology and the various uses, misuses, dangers,
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:12.140]   and in some cases, benefits of cannabis use in certain,
[01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:14.640]   the key word there is certain populations.
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:18.720]   And I also dove into whether or not cannabis can be used
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:20.740]   to increase divergent and convergent thinking.
[01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:22.240]   So that's timestamped in that episode.
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:23.500]   I'll refer you to that episode.
[01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:26.840]   But the long and short of it is that many of the ideas
[01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:30.120]   that people come up with when under the influence of cannabis
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:33.540]   in particular high THC containing cannabis
[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:37.480]   does lead to enhanced divergent thinking,
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:40.100]   but so enhanced, it turns out,
[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:42.600]   that oftentimes those ideas can't be constrained
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:44.140]   by the convergent thinking process.
[01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:47.140]   In other words, they have lots of ideas that make sense
[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:49.720]   while under the influence of cannabis,
[01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:52.640]   but that later cannot be implemented
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:54.600]   into a coherent framework
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:58.240]   that leads to any actual creative endeavor
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.000]   or creative product.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.180]   Or as is often the case with cannabis,
[01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:04.840]   they simply can't remember what they were thinking about.
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:07.120]   Anytime there's a discussion about dopamine,
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.360]   there seems to be a discussion about motivation,
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:10.480]   desire, and drive.
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:13.040]   And of course that makes sense given the roles of dopamine.
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:15.540]   We did an entire episode on dopamine, motivation, and drive.
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:17.460]   It's one of our most popular episodes.
[01:52:17.460 --> 01:52:19.620]   Again, you can access that with timestamps
[01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:22.060]   in all formats at hubermanlab.com.
[01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:23.540]   And anytime there's a discussion
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:26.260]   about dopamine and motivation,
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:28.300]   we also seem to have a lot of questions
[01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:31.540]   about attention and focus and ADHD
[01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:34.540]   or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in particular.
[01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:37.400]   So just as a brief mention, there is a literature,
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:39.440]   although not terribly extensive,
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:42.560]   a small but strong literature on the relationship
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:44.980]   between ADHD and creativity.
[01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:46.540]   And the long and short of that literature
[01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:50.620]   is that people who have ADHD, regardless of age,
[01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:53.060]   do seem to have an ability to focus.
[01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:55.020]   I've mentioned that in the episode on ADHD,
[01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:57.340]   provided that they are interested
[01:52:57.340 --> 01:52:58.980]   in the thing that they are focusing on.
[01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:00.400]   So that runs counter to this idea
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.480]   that people with ADHD simply can't focus.
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:04.620]   They can, but it tends to be a focus
[01:53:04.620 --> 01:53:05.580]   that's selective for things
[01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:07.980]   that they are very excited about or interested in,
[01:53:07.980 --> 01:53:10.980]   as opposed to a general ability to focus.
[01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:13.800]   What's also highly underappreciated
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:16.460]   is that people who have ADHD
[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:19.960]   oftentimes are very effective at divergent thinking,
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:22.860]   but are less effective at convergent thinking.
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:25.060]   What this tells us is that people with ADHD
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:29.580]   can often have excellent novel and indeed creative ideas,
[01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:32.260]   but that the implementation of those creative ideas
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:33.380]   is sometimes challenged.
[01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:36.180]   And that's one reason to explore rational pharmacology,
[01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:38.000]   nutrition, supplementation, et cetera.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.480]   Those are all things to explore
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:41.660]   in concert with, or I should say,
[01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:44.200]   in working closely with a board certified physician
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:46.960]   or ideally psychiatrist expert in ADHD.
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:49.160]   You can also check out the episode that we did on ADHD.
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:50.560]   There are a lot of tools there,
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:53.200]   a lot of science mentioned there to support those tools.
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:55.180]   Again, you can find that at hubermanlab.com.
[01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:57.200]   But I did think it was important to point out,
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.880]   even if briefly, that having ADHD
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:01.960]   is not a barrier to creativity.
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:05.800]   In fact, may actually be an enhanced portal to creativity,
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:10.120]   but that it doesn't allow people to access the convergent
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:12.680]   thinking that allows creative ideas to be implemented
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:14.920]   into specific strategies, pressure tested,
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:17.880]   and eventually delivered in the form of a final product
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:19.780]   of music, art, et cetera.
[01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:21.400]   That is not to say that people with ADHD
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:23.080]   cannot accomplish that,
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:25.640]   but that it is going to require some additional steps
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:28.720]   and protocols in order to enhance convergent thinking.
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:32.000]   And that episode and the episode that we did on focus,
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.440]   and in particular tools to enhance focus,
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:38.260]   is very much directed at ways to enhance convergent thinking.
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:40.440]   So if you have ADHD or know somebody who does,
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:42.060]   and you're interested in the creative process,
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:43.260]   we're focusing generally,
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:45.580]   please check out the episodes that I mentioned.
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:46.700]   Now there's also a small,
[01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:48.640]   but nonetheless very exciting literature
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:50.700]   on the relationship between physical movement
[01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:52.240]   and divergent thinking.
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:54.320]   This should come as no surprise to us.
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.540]   As mentioned many times now in this episode,
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:59.080]   the nigrostriatal pathway involved in divergent thinking
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:02.520]   and it involves dopamine is also responsible for eye blinks
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:05.440]   and for movements of the limbs of the body
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:07.440]   in very deliberate ways.
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:10.240]   This tells us that there's some direct
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:11.760]   or maybe indirect relationship
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:15.320]   between movement of the body and divergent thinking.
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:17.240]   And despite the fact that it's only a few studies,
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:19.400]   there have been some studies of whether or not
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:21.640]   people are able to engage in divergent thinking
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:25.000]   more effectively when they are doing things like pacing
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.600]   or walking, and this could be on a treadmill
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:29.160]   or back and forth across the room.
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:31.320]   And in fact, that is absolutely the case.
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:32.960]   If you're somebody like myself
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:36.300]   who tends to have their best ideas,
[01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:38.240]   not saying that my ideas are always terrific,
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:40.020]   but among the ideas I have,
[01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:41.860]   some of the better ones arrive to me
[01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:44.040]   while on my long Sunday run,
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:46.680]   I tend to do a long run or hike on Sundays,
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:48.460]   sometimes with a light weight vest
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:49.600]   or something of that sort.
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:52.720]   But when I'm in a state of essentially not directing
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:55.940]   my attention to any one thing in my external environment,
[01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:58.560]   this is extremely key for reasons that now should be obvious
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:55:59.920]   anytime we are directing our attention
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:02.900]   to a visual target or an auditory target,
[01:56:02.900 --> 01:56:05.400]   we are not as able to engage in divergent thinking.
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:08.280]   This is why I will sometimes listen to podcasts
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:10.040]   or to audio books while I go on these runs,
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:11.700]   but for portions of these runs or hikes,
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:15.040]   I tend to turn those off and just focus on the movement
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:17.800]   and focus on not focusing on anything in particular.
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:20.100]   And oftentimes I will stop and write down ideas
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:24.040]   that suddenly or seemingly suddenly appear to me
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:25.820]   or geyser to the surface, I'll have an idea.
[01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:28.440]   Sometimes those are good ideas, sometimes less good ideas.
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:30.520]   The fact that that happens for me and the fact that
[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:33.000]   many people are pacers or runners
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.380]   or come up with their best ideas while in the shower
[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:37.960]   or while engaging in activities that don't require
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:41.160]   a lot of sensory attention to one specific location,
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:43.960]   either visual or auditory, et cetera,
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:48.280]   that is because it engages these nigrostriatal pathways
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:51.780]   through movement, which then opens up this library of ideas
[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:54.040]   and allows the intersection of different ideas
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:57.560]   that normally would be constrained to separate categories.
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:00.600]   One way to think about this by analogy would be that,
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:02.440]   you know, when I was a kid, you'd go to the library
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:03.760]   and nowadays you just go online,
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:05.680]   but the different pages of different books
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:08.880]   on different topics are kept distinct from one another,
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:12.720]   that is bound by different book covers and bookends,
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:14.960]   different shelves in the library.
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:17.080]   It's as if different pages and elements from those books
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:19.880]   are now being combined in a pseudo random,
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:22.600]   not random, but in a pseudo random way.
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:26.060]   And in that combination, new possibilities about ways
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:28.780]   that information could be combined and implemented
[01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:29.980]   start to arise.
[01:57:29.980 --> 01:57:32.320]   So the tool that emerges from this is very simple
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:34.800]   and it won't necessarily apply to everybody.
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:36.800]   But if you are somebody who finds that just sitting
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:39.720]   in a chair and trying to be creative is very challenging,
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:41.600]   some of you might benefit from, for instance,
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:44.680]   if you are engaging in writing or you want to write,
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:48.000]   to talk into the voice recorder of your phone while walking
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.720]   or simply walking and not attending
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:52.760]   to any one specific thing visually or through headphones.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:57.420]   And then as ideas surface, seemingly out of nowhere,
[01:57:57.420 --> 01:57:58.680]   which is how it happens,
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:00.340]   that you could either put them into your phone
[01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:02.780]   by voice dictation, or you could type them out if you like.
[01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:05.060]   The key thing is to not be distracted by other things
[01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:07.140]   in your phone, not to start going onto social media
[01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:09.460]   or doing phone calls or looking at text messages,
[01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:12.960]   because that by definition is going to take you out of this,
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:15.980]   what the biologists call a pseudo random walk.
[01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:19.940]   And this pseudo random element is extremely important.
[01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:22.620]   We know, for instance, that many circuits within the brain
[01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:25.140]   have what's called dedicated point-to-point wiring.
[01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:26.780]   So for instance, the brain circuits
[01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:27.880]   that govern your breathing,
[01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:29.500]   the brain circuits that govern your heartbeat,
[01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:32.280]   the brain circuits that govern your specific movements
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:33.980]   once you were an adult and allow
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:36.880]   for smooth directed movement are very precise,
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:39.580]   very little slop, if any, in the wiring.
[01:58:39.580 --> 01:58:43.380]   However, there are aspects of your brain circuitry,
[01:58:43.380 --> 01:58:46.720]   yours and everybody else's, I should say,
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:48.660]   that are maintained into adulthood
[01:58:48.660 --> 01:58:52.020]   that include a lot of extra wiring.
[01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:54.940]   And these are fine wires, they're not the major highways
[01:58:54.940 --> 01:58:56.460]   between different areas, if you will.
[01:58:56.460 --> 01:58:58.740]   So sort of like Google Maps has highways and streets
[01:58:58.740 --> 01:59:01.860]   and little passages and alleys,
[01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:03.660]   but it's as if there's a little web
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:07.620]   of additional possible pathways cast over that entire thing.
[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:11.780]   The human brain maintains such webs of possible passage.
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:16.100]   And it's only during activities such as walking, running,
[01:59:16.100 --> 01:59:21.100]   cycling, swimming, hiking, pacing, et cetera,
[01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:24.780]   that the activation of those pseudo-random pathways
[01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:26.220]   starts to ramp up.
[01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:29.000]   So this is a purely behavioral approach
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.180]   to engaging different elements within neural networks
[01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:34.320]   that normally would not communicate with one another
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:35.940]   when we are completely still.
[01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:38.220]   So again, the practices that I talked about earlier
[01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:40.060]   of being completely still to raise dopamine
[01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:41.500]   and enhance divergent thinking,
[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:44.940]   those, I just want to reemphasize,
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:48.120]   are designed to position you, to ready you
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:49.860]   to engage in the kinds of activities
[01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:51.820]   like walking and pacing, et cetera,
[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:54.820]   that best facilitate divergent thinking.
[01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:56.740]   So if you are somebody who wants to enhance
[01:59:56.740 --> 01:59:58.720]   divergent thinking, I would encourage you
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:00.940]   to explore how different patterns of movement,
[02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:02.080]   in particular patterns of movement
[02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:04.140]   that don't require any conscious attention
[02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:06.020]   to any one specific thing,
[02:00:06.020 --> 02:00:08.620]   allow you to access new ideas
[02:00:08.620 --> 02:00:10.900]   and new ways of combining existing elements
[02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:13.580]   in whatever domain it is you want to be creative.
[02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:15.900]   Now, this is also an opportunity to underscore
[02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:17.220]   something I said back at the beginning,
[02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:18.980]   which is you are not going to come up
[02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:22.660]   with great works of music if you don't understand chords
[02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:25.000]   and melodies and notes and music.
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.860]   Those basic elements have to be built up
[02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:28.420]   through some sort of formal
[02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:30.380]   or at least rigorous or regular training,
[02:00:30.380 --> 02:00:32.200]   in the same way that you're not going to take a walk
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:34.860]   and then suddenly be able to paint an incredible picture
[02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:36.100]   if you have no painting ability.
[02:00:36.100 --> 02:00:38.000]   That is not going to happen.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.220]   What I'm talking about here are ways
[02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:41.480]   to enhance your capacity for divergent thinking,
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:45.620]   such as NSDR, and ways to engage in divergent thinking,
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:47.900]   such as through certain forms of movement
[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:49.860]   that don't require a lot of conscious attention
[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:54.240]   to your surroundings or any one specific sensory target.
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:56.900]   And in doing so, enhancing your ability
[02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:58.780]   to be more creative in a domain
[02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:01.620]   for which you already have some degree of skill
[02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:02.680]   or even mastery.
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:03.720]   Now, in keeping with the theme
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:06.220]   of how to enhance our creativity,
[02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:10.280]   there's a very exciting and yet parallel literature
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:12.900]   to the literature that I've been describing thus far.
[02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:14.680]   Now, I promise you that I'm not going to open up
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:17.980]   an entire library of new information related
[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:19.760]   to neural circuits and so forth,
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:21.900]   but I would be remiss if I didn't mention
[02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:23.300]   this parallel literature,
[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:24.980]   because it speaks very specifically
[02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:28.240]   to some important practices that we can all use
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:29.700]   in order to enhance creativity
[02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:32.660]   and to do so the first time and every time.
[02:01:32.660 --> 02:01:35.180]   And this is really because certain scientists out there
[02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:37.220]   have really gone through the trouble,
[02:01:37.220 --> 02:01:39.140]   I should even say the painstaking trouble,
[02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:42.080]   of really trying to dissect what the creative process is,
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:46.580]   both for individuals and in groups or even in pairs.
[02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:48.060]   And so what I'm about to tell you
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:51.720]   is beautifully encapsulated in an article entitled,
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:54.020]   "A New Method for Training Creativity,
[02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:57.400]   Narrative as an Alternative to Divergent Thinking."
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:01:59.460]   So again, we've been talking about divergent thinking,
[02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:01.820]   that's one pathway into the creative process,
[02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:03.320]   but there are others as well.
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:05.760]   And as it turns out, they're not so distinct
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:07.760]   in terms of the underlying brain mechanisms.
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:09.480]   Nonetheless, let me describe briefly
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:12.420]   how narrative can be used to train creativity
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:14.120]   and to become more creative.
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:15.180]   And in order to do that,
[02:02:15.180 --> 02:02:16.860]   I'd like to just briefly paraphrase
[02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:19.100]   or read from the first paragraph of this paper.
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:22.260]   So what I'm about to read are the author's words, not mine.
[02:02:22.260 --> 02:02:24.580]   Quote, "Here's a paradox.
[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:25.860]   According to current research,
[02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:29.500]   young children are more imaginatively creative than adults."
[02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:31.620]   And indeed that is true, by the way.
[02:02:31.620 --> 02:02:34.140]   "Yet also according to current research,
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:37.720]   creativity's main neural engine is divergent thinking,
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:40.820]   which relies on memory and logical association,
[02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:44.620]   two tasks at which young children underperform adults."
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:46.940]   That is, children are not as good
[02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:48.780]   at divergent thinking as adults are.
[02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:51.220]   So how could it be, the authors are asking,
[02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:53.340]   that children are more imaginative
[02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:55.860]   and thus more creative than adults?
[02:02:55.860 --> 02:02:59.380]   This can only mean that there are alternate pathways
[02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:02.300]   to creativity, and indeed that is the case.
[02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:05.400]   And so what this paper really explores
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:07.620]   is other ways to access creativity
[02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:10.800]   and what they describe is what's called narrative theory.
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:12.440]   And there's a number of different aspects
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:14.700]   to this narrative theory,
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:18.200]   but they agree that the standard definition of creativity
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:20.420]   is the same one that we were talking about before.
[02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:21.240]   So we're not talking about
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:22.600]   a different form of creativity here,
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:25.200]   we're talking about a different way to access creativity.
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:27.700]   They describe the standard definition of creativity
[02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:30.240]   as quote, "The ability to generate novel ideas
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:31.080]   that are useful."
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:32.960]   So the commonly accepted one.
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:36.800]   And what they cite as the basis for narrative theory
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:39.100]   is this breakthrough finding in the 1950s.
[02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:40.400]   This is the work of Guilford.
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:42.040]   Some people out there might be familiar with it.
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:45.000]   I was not at the outset of researching this episode.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.520]   What this theory from Guilford essentially states
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:49.640]   is that there are different intellectual capacities
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:51.600]   that are not captured by standard IQ tests.
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:53.320]   I think that's generally accepted nowadays.
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:55.220]   We know there's emotional intelligence,
[02:03:55.220 --> 02:03:57.720]   we know there's standard IQ, et cetera.
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:00.200]   But the important element to understand
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:04.360]   is that these authors were able to trace back the idea
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:08.880]   of narrative training as a way to enhance creativity
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:11.000]   long before Guilford in the 1950s,
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.080]   all the way back to Aristotle.
[02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:14.140]   So this is incredible.
[02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:18.800]   Narrative theory was actually birthed in 335 BCE
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:20.640]   in his writing called "Poetics,"
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:23.960]   which I think is incredible, at least to me,
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:27.280]   that people long before us were thinking about creativity
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:29.120]   and what goes into creativity.
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:32.260]   And what Aristotle said, what Guilford then elaborated on,
[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:36.360]   and what the authors of this paper further elaborate on
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:38.760]   and actually have developed training protocols for
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:41.400]   is the idea that there are three elements that we can use
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:42.840]   in order to enhance creativity.
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:47.060]   And those three elements are what's called world building.
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:48.640]   I'll explain what these are in a moment.
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:52.340]   Perspective shifting and action generating.
[02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:53.940]   And right off the bat,
[02:04:53.940 --> 02:04:56.640]   the word action should raise a flag for you.
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:58.760]   And by that, I mean a positive flag,
[02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:01.040]   because once again, we are back into the world
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:04.440]   and therefore the neural circuits of movement and motion.
[02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:06.920]   Okay, so three elements of world building,
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:09.460]   perspective shifting and active generating
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:12.300]   are what make up this narrative approach to creativity.
[02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:14.380]   And I should mention that these authors and others
[02:05:14.380 --> 02:05:16.680]   are using such approach with companies,
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:17.940]   with groups, with individuals.
[02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:19.880]   So this is used in a bunch of different contexts
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:23.820]   to approach and enhance different forms of creativity.
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:27.200]   So let's talk first about world building techniques.
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:30.660]   This is going to be immediately familiar to you
[02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:31.580]   when you hear it.
[02:05:31.580 --> 02:05:35.400]   But one of the key elements of creativity is to,
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:39.600]   at the outset, come up with some idea that makes sense
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:42.740]   or is attractive to you about how the world is different
[02:05:42.740 --> 02:05:44.880]   inside of your creative endeavor.
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:47.280]   So for those that write science fiction
[02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:48.700]   or think about science fiction,
[02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:50.920]   there's some obvious aspects to this.
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:52.240]   But for those of you that don't,
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:54.200]   maybe you come up with a narrative, for instance,
[02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:57.420]   in the context of storytelling that in your world,
[02:05:57.420 --> 02:05:59.460]   we are the house cats
[02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:01.980]   and the cats are actually the ones
[02:06:01.980 --> 02:06:03.380]   that are the curators of the earth.
[02:06:03.380 --> 02:06:06.860]   Okay, so right there, there is a conceptual shift
[02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:09.640]   that the world in which whatever creative idea
[02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:11.780]   is going to emerge is entirely different
[02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:13.460]   than the one that we actually live in.
[02:06:13.460 --> 02:06:15.940]   So that sets a certain number of important constraints.
[02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:17.440]   It means certain things are now possible,
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:18.620]   other things are not possible
[02:06:18.620 --> 02:06:21.260]   that are very different from the world that we live in.
[02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:22.700]   You can see the parallels here
[02:06:22.700 --> 02:06:24.420]   to kind of childhood imagination
[02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:27.100]   where essentially anything can happen in the child's mind
[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:28.640]   because they are unconstrained.
[02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:31.520]   The second element is this perspective shifting techniques.
[02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:35.560]   And the idea here is that not only are we supposed
[02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:39.960]   to have the reader or the listener or the observer or us
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:43.560]   explore for creativity and develop a creative idea
[02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:45.700]   by thinking differently, right,
[02:06:45.700 --> 02:06:46.920]   which is kind of a generic term,
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:48.560]   how do we actually think differently?
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:50.620]   But rather than just say,
[02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:52.640]   take the perspective of somebody else
[02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:56.020]   in terms of what they would see or do or say or think,
[02:06:56.020 --> 02:06:58.680]   rather, we are supposed to think about their underlying
[02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:01.720]   motivation so we could do the world shift,
[02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:03.900]   that is the world structure shift from step one.
[02:07:03.900 --> 02:07:06.420]   And then in step two, you would ask yourself,
[02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:09.940]   okay, rather than write about or think about
[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:12.300]   or move from the perspective of myself,
[02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:14.760]   let's say you're feeling particularly happy that day,
[02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:16.600]   you'd say, you know, I'm actually going to take
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:18.560]   the perspective of somebody who's angry,
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:20.660]   but rather than just act angry,
[02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:22.400]   I'm going to think about what their motivation
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:23.300]   for being angry is.
[02:07:23.300 --> 02:07:26.200]   Maybe they had a breakup, maybe they were jealous,
[02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:28.360]   maybe somebody had wronged them in some way,
[02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:30.200]   maybe they're just generally angry at the world
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:31.160]   for whatever reason,
[02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:33.740]   and then operate from that motivational stance.
[02:07:33.740 --> 02:07:36.960]   And this is a very interesting and powerful step
[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:38.340]   because what it really captures,
[02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:41.100]   at least as viewed by me, the neuroscientist,
[02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:43.020]   is it captures a whole set of neural circuits
[02:07:43.020 --> 02:07:45.460]   about what that motivational state means
[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:48.360]   because motivational states dictate a huge number
[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.880]   of possible different outcomes,
[02:07:49.880 --> 02:07:52.880]   but they really constrain the number of different actions
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:55.120]   and outcomes that any of us would engage in.
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:56.860]   Rather than saying, I'm going to view the world
[02:07:56.860 --> 02:07:58.600]   the way that someone else would view the world,
[02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:00.660]   by stating that we are going to be motivated
[02:08:00.660 --> 02:08:03.280]   by their set of motivations and not our own,
[02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:05.360]   it includes a lot more possibilities
[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:07.820]   and yet not an infinite number of possibilities.
[02:08:07.820 --> 02:08:09.600]   They are constrained in a logical way,
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:12.160]   which is one of the key elements of creativity.
[02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:13.400]   And then this third element,
[02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:16.400]   which is action-generating techniques,
[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:19.440]   is a really cool one that you will immediately notice
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:21.220]   implications for the workplace,
[02:08:21.220 --> 02:08:23.360]   which is forced collaboration.
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:25.760]   So inside of this thing that we're building here,
[02:08:25.760 --> 02:08:26.800]   this kind of story,
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:30.340]   you create a novel rule for the world
[02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:32.000]   that your story is going to exist in,
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:33.480]   or your music is going to exist in,
[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:35.040]   or your sport will exist in.
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:38.560]   Then you create this perspective shift
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:41.720]   where you take on the motivation of someone else
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:42.960]   different than you.
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:46.040]   And then you force collaboration between that person
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:49.200]   who has this alternate motivation, different from you,
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:51.680]   and someone else who has an entirely different motivation.
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:54.040]   And in doing so, you create these kind of
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:55.620]   what are called the creative collisions.
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:08:58.060]   Now they're collisions because they're crossing one another
[02:08:58.060 --> 02:08:59.860]   and something new has to emerge from them.
[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:01.480]   They could be antagonistic.
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:03.280]   They could be arguments, fighting, physical,
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:04.620]   or verbal or otherwise.
[02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:06.300]   They could be synergistic.
[02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:07.960]   They could take on any number of different forms
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:10.280]   depending on the motivations and the individuals
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:11.480]   that are involved.
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:15.160]   But even though I just described this in fairly top contour,
[02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:18.440]   what I just described is actually the core elements
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:20.880]   of any story or any creative endeavor.
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:23.080]   It's just that many stories are from the perspective
[02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:25.680]   of what we already know and believe
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:27.680]   and think the world to be.
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:32.120]   And our own perspective and the actions that we would take
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:34.100]   given that world and that perspective.
[02:09:34.100 --> 02:09:36.200]   Whereas if we want to be creative,
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:38.700]   we want to think outside of our usual framework
[02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:41.200]   and yet using elements that exist within us, right?
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:43.180]   No one has to tell us the creative narrative.
[02:09:43.180 --> 02:09:45.160]   We're trying to come up with it on our own.
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:47.920]   We want to essentially think in a childlike way.
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:49.100]   How do children think?
[02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:54.060]   Well, they have new, different, or entirely novel concepts
[02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:57.200]   about how the world works, but those are bounded.
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:58.120]   And this is a key word.
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:09:58.960]   Those are bounded.
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:09:59.780]   They're not infinite.
[02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:01.900]   It's not that anything can happen, right?
[02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:03.280]   Some kids will say we can fly
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:05.040]   and you can shoot lasers out of your eyes.
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:05.880]   You can do all sorts of things.
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:08.160]   There are unicorns, a candy falling from the sky.
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:12.520]   At some point, if you don't bound the change in the world,
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:13.880]   it just becomes pure chaos.
[02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:15.040]   And even children don't do that.
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:16.580]   So we need to bound the change
[02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:20.220]   and yet create some alternate universe, if you will,
[02:10:20.220 --> 02:10:23.900]   in which the story takes place or the creation of any kind.
[02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:25.300]   Doesn't have to be a story takes place.
[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:26.760]   Then there has to be a perspective shift.
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:27.640]   And this is very useful.
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:30.240]   This is actually a tool that we can all use
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:32.360]   of trying to take the perspective of others,
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:36.140]   but not just asking what they would feel or think or do,
[02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:39.700]   but ask what is their motivation in life generally?
[02:10:39.700 --> 02:10:43.160]   Or what kind of mood stance or goal stance are they taking?
[02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:44.760]   Are they trying to extract from others?
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:46.200]   Are they trying to give to others?
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:48.380]   Are they very altruistic, et cetera, et cetera?
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:50.260]   And then you take that individual
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:52.940]   and you do that also for another individual
[02:10:52.940 --> 02:10:53.920]   or group of individuals.
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:55.140]   And you start thinking about
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:57.200]   how those different individuals,
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:59.260]   because of their different motivational states,
[02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:01.180]   would engage at the level of action,
[02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:02.440]   what they would do, what they would say,
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:05.600]   would they mate, would they fight, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:06.720]   You think of any story,
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:09.680]   the story of "Star Wars," the Greek myths,
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:13.360]   you think of any story that has been created,
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:16.320]   which we consider great and novel works,
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:19.200]   and you start to find these three elements,
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:21.520]   world-building, perspective-shifting,
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:23.320]   and action-generating techniques.
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:27.320]   And so while this is, again, just a broad contour
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:29.240]   of what this narrative approach involves,
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:31.600]   I think it's a very important and very exciting one
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:33.400]   because it gives us a formula, right?
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:34.980]   We already know that divergent thinking
[02:11:34.980 --> 02:11:36.600]   and convergent thinking are both elements
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:38.460]   to the creative process.
[02:11:38.460 --> 02:11:41.120]   This is suggesting that whether or not
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:43.080]   it involves divergent thinking or not,
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:44.840]   these authors seem to think this is distinct
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:46.040]   from divergent thinking,
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:48.640]   that capturing some of the elements of creativity
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:49.920]   that are present in childhood,
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:51.280]   but that then tend to disappear
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:53.760]   as we start to assume identity, build identity,
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:56.680]   and understand rules about the actual world we live in,
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:00.280]   all of those basic elements of early childhood creativity
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:03.220]   can be reawakened, and in fact, they have data to support
[02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:05.200]   the fact that they can be reawakened in adults
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:07.960]   in meaningful ways that can lead to new product design,
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:10.700]   new workplace interactions, and on and on.
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:12.720]   That I find very exciting.
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:16.800]   And as a consequence, I do intend to do an entire episode
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:19.440]   at some point on narrative and storytelling
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:21.280]   and the role of narrative and storytelling,
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:22.660]   not just for sake of creativity,
[02:12:22.660 --> 02:12:25.920]   but also for accessing neuroplasticity
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:27.860]   and for enhancing memory and so on.
[02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:29.520]   There's an entire landscape of literature
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:31.880]   and exciting tools and things to understand there.
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:34.880]   But in the meantime, we will provide a link to this paper.
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:37.360]   And for those of you that choose not to access the paper,
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:40.920]   simply understanding these three aspects of narrative
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:43.120]   as an alternative to accessing creativity,
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:47.040]   that is a dedicated and well understood
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:49.420]   or established world shift that you choose,
[02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:52.660]   perspective shifting and taking on the motivation of others,
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:56.080]   and creating some sort of landscape of exploration
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:57.760]   for what sorts of interactions would occur
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:12:59.680]   between that individual or groups of individuals
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:02.600]   and other individuals that have other motivations
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:05.880]   and yet are still living in this alternate world.
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:08.920]   Those three elements we now know can be combined
[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:11.580]   into what you or I or anyone
[02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:13.880]   would consider important creative works.
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:16.380]   So today we discussed creativity,
[02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:20.520]   this absolutely fascinating aspect to human brain function
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:23.760]   that has allowed us as a species to develop everything
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:26.040]   from great works of art and music
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:29.160]   to technological innovations that allow us to fly
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:31.200]   and allow us to access people all over the world
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:33.440]   through little screen devices that we carry around
[02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:35.600]   in our pockets and on and on.
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:38.800]   As I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:42.560]   I find creativity to be one of the most fascinating aspects
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:45.080]   of brain function, and in particular,
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:47.080]   because we don't actually know
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:48.800]   what the upper limits of creativity are,
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:52.880]   and yet we understand that there are certain bounds,
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:54.040]   there are certain requirements.
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:56.160]   And the key requirement for creativity
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:57.640]   is this aspect of utility.
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:13:59.160]   Now that doesn't necessarily mean
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:01.200]   that for something to be considered creative,
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:04.320]   it has to be useful in the practical sense,
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:06.160]   but it does seem that for something
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:09.960]   to be considered truly creative or especially creative
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:13.420]   in some cases, that it revealed to us something fundamental
[02:14:13.420 --> 02:14:16.660]   about the way that we or the world works.
[02:14:16.660 --> 02:14:18.000]   We discussed some of the neural circuits
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.120]   that underlie the different aspects of creativity,
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:22.120]   in particular, divergent and convergent thinking,
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:23.880]   as well as narrative building,
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:26.480]   and some of the tools and steps that can allow us
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:30.440]   to better access divergent thinking and convergent thinking.
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:32.680]   And those tools include behavioral tools
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:34.480]   as well as pharmacology.
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:36.680]   And we talked about narrative building
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:39.000]   as a way to reawaken, or I should say,
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.260]   re-access the childhood creativity that did indeed exist
[02:14:43.260 --> 02:14:45.640]   in all of us at some point in time.

[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:19.740]   As mentioned at the beginning of today's podcast,
[02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:21.940]   we've partnered with Momentous Supplements,
[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:24.680]   because Momentous Supplements are the very highest quality.
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:26.680]   They have single ingredient formulations,
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:28.760]   which turns out to be most effective
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:30.120]   in building a supplement protocol.
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:31.120]   And when I say most effective,
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:33.160]   I mean most biologically effective
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:34.400]   and most cost effective.
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:37.120]   And we're fortunate that they ship internationally
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:38.560]   because we know that many of you reside
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:40.080]   outside of the United States.
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:41.620]   If you want to check out the supplements mentioned
[02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:43.040]   in today's and in other episodes

[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:32.240]   On all those social media platforms,
[02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:34.120]   I describe science and science-related tools,
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:35.560]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:37.140]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:16:37.140 --> 02:16:39.260]   but often which does not overlap
[02:16:39.260 --> 02:16:40.920]   with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:43.220]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all platforms.
[02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:44.720]   So thank you once again for joining me
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:45.720]   for today's discussion,
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:48.560]   all about the science and tools for creativity.
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:51.000]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:52.760]   thank you for your interest in science.
