[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   Hello, and welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.760]   Well, porcelain nativity sets are a popular choice for mantle decor in the
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.360]   Christian home this time of year.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.120]   But are these sets forbidden from our places of worship by the second commandment?
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.800]   It's a great and timely question sent in to us by a listener named Lisa.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.200]   Lisa writes in to ask this.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.560]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.920]   I just started reading Knowing God by J.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.080]   I.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.680]   Packer.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.920]   And in chapter four, he discusses the second commandment.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.800]   I've always assumed this referred to actual objects of worship, like
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.000]   crucifixes or pagan idols.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.400]   But Packer seems to say any material or even mental images of all or part of the
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.280]   Trinity is forbidden.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.840]   Perhaps even a nativity set, I wonder, and even frescoes painted inside the Sistine
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.440]   Chapel.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.600]   His argument made sense.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.760]   In our finiteness, we can't accurately represent him.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.720]   So it would be inaccurate and essentially a lie.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.800]   Having grown up in Baptist churches that lean pretty reformed, I'm surprised I've
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.080]   never heard or thought of this before.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.960]   Have you?
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.040]   Yes, because I've read Packer.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.920]   If J.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.080]   I.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.760]   Packer says something, it would be wise to pause and take it very seriously.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.960]   So I got out my old 1973 edition of Knowing God.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.600]   And I reviewed chapter four.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.240]   It's about idolatry and specifically about the second commandment of the Ten
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.880]   Commandments.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.800]   And let me read the key verses that he's dealing with.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.600]   This is Exodus 20, verse four.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.560]   "You shall not make for yourself a carved image or any likeness of anything that is
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.160]   in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.040]   earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I, the Lord your God, am a
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.200]   jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.560]   fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.440]   those who love me and keep my commandments."
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:20.080]   So Packer's point is that this commandment tells us not only not to worship false
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.200]   gods, which he says would simply repeat the first commandment, "You shall not have
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.360]   other gods before me," but rather is telling us how not to worship the true God
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.840]   falsely.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.800]   In other words, it's not just about whom we worship, but how we worship.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.600]   And he quotes Charles Hodge saying that the point of the second commandment is
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:55.760]   this, "Idolatry consists not only in the worship of false gods, but also in the
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.280]   worship of the true God by images."
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.400]   And then he says this, that is, Packer says this, "In its Christian application,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   this means that we are not to make use of visual or pictorial representations of the
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:23.360]   triune God or any person of the Trinity for the purposes of Christian worship.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.280]   What it tells us is that," this is still Packer, "What it tells us is that statues
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.880]   and pictures of the one whom we worship are not to be used as an aid to worshiping
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.120]   him."
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.120]   And then he explains why.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.240]   Two things.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.800]   One, images dishonor God, for they obscure his glory.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.160]   They conceal most, if not all, of the truth about the personal nature and the
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.440]   character of the divine being.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.000]   And two, images mislead men.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.200]   They convey false ideas about God.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.960]   Now, the whole chapter is worth reading.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.960]   I encourage everybody, if you haven't read "Knowing God" by J.I.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.800]   Packer, it's a modern classic for good reasons.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.760]   Now, he's still living and still faithful, I believe, and I would encourage everybody
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.200]   to pick it up and read it.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:25.360]   Now, Lisa says, "Packer seems to say any material or even mental images of all or
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.440]   any part of the Trinity is forbidden, perhaps even a nativity scene, I wonder,
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.840]   even frescoes on the Sistine Chapel."
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.880]   So I have two responses to that application.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.640]   With regard to the Sistine Chapel, I would say not even the Sistine Chapel, but
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.720]   especially the Sistine Chapel.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:57.520]   I think the spectacular genius and gifting of Michelangelo as an artist has almost
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:04.160]   totally eclipsed the fact that the chapel is full of images that not only break the
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.000]   Second Commandment, but because of the ubiquitous nudity, compounds idolatry with
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.880]   obscenity.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.840]   Now, remember, we're talking about a chapel, chapel, chapel, chapel, not a museum
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.920]   where worship is to be happening.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.760]   We were there a year ago, and when you walked in, the place was crawling with noisy
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.240]   Americans and the poor guards were saying, "Shh, shh, shh, this is a place of worship.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.920]   Shh, shh."
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.600]   Didn't work at all.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.440]   But that's clearly the intention.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.680]   And whatever you think of nudity in art, the use of nudity in worship is, I think,
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.680]   absurd.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.200]   Absurd.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:49.880]   And I'm tempted to say, I will say, especially male nudity with single male
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.800]   priests.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.960]   But the point here is that this is a chapel.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.320]   This is a place of worship.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.520]   And the image of God the Father as a white European male encased in a shape like a
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.840]   human brain is, I would say, an almost perfect embodiment of what is forbidden in
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.880]   the Second Commandment.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.520]   This is not the way God calls us to worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.520]   So if you have a Michelangelo in your church, don't commission him to paint a
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.120]   representation of God on the ceiling of your church.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.320]   Don't do it.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.200]   No matter how good he is.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.360]   Painting, let me say something positive here, painting is a great part of creation.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.320]   And creation is declaring the glory of God.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.120]   Artists will never exhaust the glories of God if they confine themselves to the
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.080]   vastness and complexity of the wonders of creation.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.520]   That's what we're supposed to do with it.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.520]   Reshape it, remake it, represent it, draw out of it glories.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.080]   Plenty to do there.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.920]   You don't need to create God the Father on the ceiling of your church in order to
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.760]   get the Michelangelos in your church busy.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.560]   Now, my second and last response to Lisa's sentence has to do with nativity
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:13.960]   scenes.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:20.200]   She wonders if the Second Commandment bans the representation of the baby Jesus in
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.880]   the art of nativity scenes, because he's the second person of the Trinity.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.800]   And the same question is raised, of course, in picturing Jesus, for example, in
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.640]   children's books.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.680]   My goodness, they almost all do it.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.680]   Should we?
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.680]   I think the key here is given by Packer himself.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.080]   So let me read what he says.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.880]   He says, "Historically, Christians have differed as to whether the Second
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.880]   Commandment forbids the use of pictures of Jesus for purposes of teaching and
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.960]   instruction in Sunday school, for example.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.160]   And the question is not an easy one to settle."
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.360]   I'm still quoting.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:02.000]   "But there is no room for doubting that the commandment obliges us to dissociate
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.040]   our worship, both in public and private, from all pictures and statues of Christ,
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.520]   no less from pictures and statues of his Father."
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.520]   I agree with that.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:19.880]   So everything hangs on whether we are able to distinguish the use of pictures
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.800]   of Christ, which may be warranted because he was both man and God.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.000]   There's the one difference between the Holy Spirit, the Father, and Jesus, is
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   that Jesus became part of creation.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.680]   Whether we can distinguish the use of pictures of Christ in worship from using
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.640]   them in other ways that don't involve worship is the question.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.560]   Packer's right, I think.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:50.480]   It is not easy to settle this issue because, in a sense, we should be
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.200]   worshiping in all that we do.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:09:00.280]   And oh, how easy, how easy for a picture to become the source of our affections,
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:07.000]   seemingly for God, rather than Christ himself becoming the source of our
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.720]   affections.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.720]   Now, let's be honest here as I close.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:15.040]   Our house at Christmas time is full of nativity scenes.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:22.560]   I dare say the Piper household has more nativity scenes than 99.9% of the houses
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:28.920]   in the world because my wife collects them from all the different ethnicities.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.800]   I mean, we've got elephants in the scenes.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.440]   They're from all over Africa and Europe and cultures around the world trying to
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.440]   portray the Holy Family in appropriate ways to their culture.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.200]   We love this cross-cultural dimension of Christmas.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.160]   He came for all the nations, and the wise men were people from outside Judea.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:54.400]   I hope, I say this hope and I say it carefully, I hope these scenes simply
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.600]   serve to say one loud, glorious fact in the Piper household.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.680]   God sent Christ to save sinners like us.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.680]   And look at him in the gospel, Piper.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.160]   Look at him in the gospel.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:16.680]   Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God, not by seeing images.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.920]   That's really good.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.320]   Packer's still with us.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.680]   I think he's in his early nineties now, 93.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.880]   Yeah, bless him.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.560]   What a gift he's been to the church.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.160]   He really has been.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.920]   I had the honor of talking with him on the phone a couple of weeks ago.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.560]   And before I hung up, he voluntarily wanted to tell me that he's holding fast to the
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.800]   gospel and to his theological convictions.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.440]   So it was just great to hear him affirm that.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.800]   And he wanted me to know, and I assume everybody to know, that he is holding fast.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.200]   Loads of implications to ponder in this episode.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.120]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.360]   That's a great question, Lisa.

[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.240]   Well, speaking of Christmas time specifics, next time we talk about whether or not Christmas
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.520]   dinner is the best time for evangelism with non-believers who may be joining you.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.120]   What are some factors to consider and what is some practical advice Pastor John has for
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.240]   those moments to speak of Christ to non-believers around the Christmas time dinner table?
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.400]   That's up next time.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.480]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.480]   We'll see you on Monday.
