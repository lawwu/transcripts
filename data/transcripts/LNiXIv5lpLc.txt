[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words that are to be found
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:12.560]   in the last phrase in the 18th chapter of the first chapter, 18th verse of the first
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.080]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Colossians.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.620]   The epistle to the Colossians, chapter 1, the last portion of the 18th verse, that in
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:35.360]   all things he might have the pre-eminence, that in all things he might have the pre-eminence.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.380]   That indeed is the answer to the question that we've just been asking in our last hymn,
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.000]   what shall I give him?
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   That's the answer.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.740]   Give him the pre-eminence, because, as I'm hoping to show you, it is his, and it is his
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.960]   by right, and it is his and his alone.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.840]   Now we've been working our way through this great statement of the gospel which is given
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.520]   us here by the apostle in this first chapter of this epistle to the Colossians.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.020]   And we have seen that he tells us that the test as to whether we are Christians or not
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.040]   is that we give thanks unto the Father.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.200]   That is the ultimate test which we must all apply to ourselves.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.320]   To what extent are we thanking God for what he has done for us and our salvation?
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:36.140]   Thankfulness is, beyond any question, the acid test of any true profession of the Christian
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.140]   faith.
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:46.060]   A man who rarely believes is a man who is inevitably giving thanks unto God.
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.140]   And we've been working through the reasons which the apostle here adduces as to why we
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.660]   should do so.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.360]   And we have seen, of course, that they're almost endless in number.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.520]   But there's one thing we've kept unseen, and that is that in every instance it comes to
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.080]   this person, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.380]   And therefore, the apostle keeps on repeating his name, but here in this phrase that we
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.080]   are looking at tonight, he picks it out.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.440]   What he has been implying, what he has been saying implicitly, he now says explicitly,
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.680]   that in all things he might have the preeminence.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.600]   Now it's very interesting to notice the way in which the apostle came to say this and
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.160]   to do this very thing.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.520]   The pedants, the mere literary critics, the people who are more interested in form than
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:52.680]   in substance, are very fond of criticizing this great apostle for his bad style.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.120]   What they mean by that is, of course, that he constantly interrupts what he's saying
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.200]   himself, and as it were goes off at a tangent, and then he comes back again.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   Now, we've got a perfect illustration of that in this whole passage that is before us.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.640]   You see, he starts off by saying, "Giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.840]   meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who hath delivered us
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.000]   from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son, in whom
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.960]   we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins," and then he obviously
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.840]   intended to go on with that particular matter.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.520]   But he turns aside, "in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.680]   sins," and he begins to tell us something about this blessed Lord, who is the image
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.600]   of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.280]   "For by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.960]   invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers, all things were
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:03.920]   created by him and for him, and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.600]   And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.080]   dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.600]   For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell."
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.320]   And there was no more to be said.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.320]   That's everything.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.840]   All the fullness of the Godhead in him.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.320]   So back he comes to where he broke off, "and having made peace through the blood of his
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.040]   cross," that's what he was saying in verse 14 before he went off, "in whom we have redemption
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.440]   through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins," now then he comes back to it.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.200]   And as we saw last Sunday night, he works it out again and says what he'd originally
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.760]   intended to say.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.600]   But in these verses, 15 to 19, that we are looking at tonight, and especially this great
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:02.560]   phrase which sums it all up at the end of this 18th verse, the apostle, I say, turns
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:14.720]   aside in order to remind these Colossian Christians of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   thanks unto the Father, what for, well, for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:28.300]   But you see, he felt it necessary and incumbent upon him to go into a certain amount of detail
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.520]   and to remind them as to who he is.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.520]   Why does he do this?
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.080]   Well, I've kept on telling you, he does this because conditions had arisen which made it
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.480]   more or less imperative for him to do so.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.760]   This apostle and others, like this man Epaphras, had gone round preaching the gospel and people
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.000]   had believed churches had been formed and they were rejoicing in their salvation, but
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.520]   false teachers arose.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.760]   And these false teachers began to go round and to say that they'd got a much better message,
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.120]   much more wonderful gospel than this.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.680]   This man Paul, they said, he's nothing to look at.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.000]   His presence is weak and his speech contemptible, and he keeps on saying the same thing all
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.360]   along, always preaching about that cross.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.880]   There's no philosophy in his message.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.640]   There's no exhortation to some wonderful ascetic practices.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.120]   Oh, it's so simple and it's so ordinary, so mundane.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.120]   Listen, they said.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.640]   And then they put before them their new theories, their new ideas, their new religion, which
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.920]   they claimed was so much superior.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.880]   Well, why does the apostle get troubled about this?
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:44.120]   Well, he does so for one main reason, and that was that these false teachings were detracting
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:53.240]   and derogating from the preeminence and the glory and the majesty and the wonder of the
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.280]   Son of God, our blessed Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.440]   And that was something the apostle would not tolerate.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.700]   That was something he would never stand.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.400]   He said some very plain and mighty things about it.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.400]   Why?
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.880]   Well, because not only of his love for the Savior, but because he saw that these other
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.480]   theories were robbing men of his salvation.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.880]   They were the invention of the devil and of hell.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.480]   They're to be unmasked and exposed for the counterfeit and the sham that they really
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.480]   are.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.480]   That's why he does it.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.000]   You see, these are the teachings, as I've reminded you.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.280]   They were saying that the problem is how can men somehow or another find God and be blessed
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.280]   by him?
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.400]   And they said the answer is that there were a large number of intermediaries between God
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.680]   and men, some angelic beings, created beings, all of them, and that you started with an
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.600]   angel who was just a little bit higher than men and another higher than he and on and
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:58.280]   on, a great hierarchy of angelic beings, until eventually you arrived at God.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.200]   And they were saying that Jesus of Nazareth was but one of these.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.580]   They admitted that he was created before time.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.880]   They said he was greater than men and that he existed before men, but he was still only
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.640]   an angelic being.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:19.280]   What they were denying was his deity, his co-equality and co-eternity with the Father.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.660]   They said, "No, no, that's wrong," they said, "you're trying to put somebody by the side
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.660]   of God.
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.800]   There's only one God."
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.940]   And they were doing that, you see, in terms of taking from the glory of the Lord Jesus
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.940]   Christ.
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.940]   That's why Paul writes his epistle.
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.640]   He says you're being confused by what is but human philosophy.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.480]   It's a muddle of philosophy, asceticism, and moralism.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.960]   And it is of the devil.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.920]   It's the rudiments of the world.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.920]   Don't listen to them, he said.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.440]   Don't go back to that.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.720]   But realize who this blessed person is in whom you believe.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.200]   Realize the full truth about him.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:04.880]   In other words, realize that in all things he must have the preeminence.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:10.040]   And I need scarcely tell you that such a teaching is as necessary for us tonight as it was in
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.280]   the first century.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.920]   There are people who go about and think that they do God honor and that they serve him
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.800]   in denying these great truths about the Son of God.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:27.440]   They stand for Jehovah, they say, and they do so at the expense of the Son.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.240]   There's nothing new about it.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.760]   Its particular form is new, of course.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:37.720]   It comes with all the trickery and the slick business acumen which is associated with most
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.840]   of these cults and the country from which they come.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.120]   But there's nothing new about it.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.040]   It's as old, you see, as this heresy that was troubling the church at Colossae.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.420]   But it sounds so clever, doesn't it, as if it's defending God against some attack.
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.880]   But it's insulting him, for whoever insults the Son insults the Father.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.460]   The Lord Jesus Christ himself said that.
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.400]   He said, "Whosoever glorifieth not me, glorifieth not God."
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.800]   And he said, "No man can glorify God unless he glorifies the Son."
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:15.720]   So anybody who tries to take anything from the Son is of the devil.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.640]   We are not merely believers in God, we are Christians.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.800]   We believe in God, they said, this blessed person believes also in me.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:32.140]   We are Trinitarians, and the whole message of Christmas is a Trinitarian message.
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:37.200]   We believe in God in three persons, blessed Trinity, God the Father, God the Son, God
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.600]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.160]   Yes, amen, this is the essential truth.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.480]   There is no gospel apart from it.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.440]   But my friends, we must be clear about this.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.060]   And that's why I'm calling attention to it this evening, this evening of all evenings.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.700]   But you see, I've got a subsidiary and very practical object and intention also.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:06.100]   And that is that we may look again into the mystery of that first Christmas, that we may
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:12.220]   have an understanding of what has taken place in and through our Lord and Savior, Jesus
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.220]   Christ.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.060]   That's the trouble with us, that's the trouble with all of us, that's the trouble
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.500]   with those of us who are Christian.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.180]   We don't realize these things as we ought to.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:28.100]   The thing is so stupendous, so majestic, so immense, we can't rise to it.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:33.300]   Our minds buddle, our imaginations are utterly defeated.
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.140]   But we must try and thank God that the Apostle has put it in this form.
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.300]   Let's follow him.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.460]   He says that in all things, he may have the preeminence.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:49.300]   He means this, that God's way of saving us, that the Father's way of saving us, and
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:54.780]   the reason, therefore, why we should give thanks to the Father, is that he has done
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:12:00.820]   it all in and through this blessed person, his only begotten Son.
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:06.820]   So, as we give the Son preeminence, we are obviously giving the glory also to the Father
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.220]   at the same time.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:14.580]   We praise, we adore the three blessed persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.900]   Well now then, why should he have the preeminence in all things?
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.060]   And the Apostle gives us three main answers.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:28.980]   The first is, he should have the preeminence because he is who and what he is.
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.620]   In his own person demands it.
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.820]   Well what is the truth about him?
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:40.340]   Well, listen to the Apostle, who is, he says, the image of the invisible God.
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.340]   What a statement!
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:46.340]   See, that's what Christmas is about.
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:53.300]   That babe in that manger in Bethlehem is the image of the invisible God.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.980]   God is invisible.
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.620]   God is Spirit.
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.300]   No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.060]   No man can see God.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.380]   He dwelleth in a light which is unapproachable.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:10.220]   But this babe is the image of the invisible God.
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:15.620]   Now this is tremendous, isn't it?
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.860]   You see, we are already in a realm entirely removed from what the world calls Christmas
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.520]   spirit, aren't we?
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.520]   But this is it.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.140]   You see, you've got to think, you've got to understand, and this is what it is.
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.140]   That's who that babe is, he's the image of the invisible God.
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.140]   What does image mean?
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.540]   Well, now let's be clear about this word image.
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:40.740]   It doesn't just mean a mere likeness, a mere resemblance.
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:46.900]   You can often get that quite accidentally, as the authorities have often pointed out.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.540]   You may have a great collection of eggs and you may suddenly notice that two of them appear
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.540]   to be identical.
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.380]   Now that isn't image.
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:14:00.660]   That is nothing but a mere accidental similarity, a very superficial likeness.
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.060]   Well what does this word image mean?
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.900]   Well here are the best illustrations.
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:12.100]   Look at a postage stamp, and there you see the head of the queen, that's an image.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:16.740]   That's not something accidental, that is something which has been produced and done
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.740]   deliberately.
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:22.660]   Or take out a coin, look at your penny, there you see that head again.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:27.420]   Now that comes nearer to defining what we mean by an image.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:32.860]   It's an impression that is made, and it's an exact likeness.
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.020]   But we can go further, there's something even stronger.
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:41.460]   Don't we often say about a child, he's the very image of his father, the very image
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.500]   of his mother?
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.500]   That brings it nearer still.
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.300]   That's right, that's what it really means, that there is something here of that father
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.780]   or mother which is being reproduced exactly.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.700]   It's coming out in this child.
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.340]   You look at the child and you see the father or the mother, the image, that's it, that's
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.340]   the notion.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:06.180]   Well, what we are told here is that the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, is the exact
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:13.200]   likeness, the express image, the very embodiment of the Father, and is a complete revelation
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.060]   of him and of his nature.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:20.460]   Now this is a term that is used so constantly in the Scriptures.
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.700]   This same apostle in writing to the Colossians, in writing to the Corinthians, you remember
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:29.620]   in his second epistle in chapter 4, he says this, "If people don't believe in the gospel,"
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:34.900]   he said, "it is because they are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:40.700]   minds of them that believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:45.860]   image of God, should shine unto them."
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:50.420]   Later on in the same chapter he says, "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:56.860]   has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.340]   face of Jesus Christ."
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.700]   You look into his face and you see the Father.
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.300]   He said it himself, "He who hath seen me hath seen the Father."
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:11.820]   I'll take that expression of it which we read at the beginning in Hebrews 1, 3, "Who being
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:18.460]   the brightness of his glory," of God's glory, "and the express image of his person."
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.580]   Well, you can't get beyond that.
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.140]   Language finishes at that point.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:31.500]   But what he does say is this, that this babe born in Bethlehem in that stable is the very
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.660]   image of the invisible God.
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:40.940]   Here's the greatest thing that's ever happened in this world, my friend.
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.860]   We're all so excited about the marvelous and wonderful things we are doing these days—advances
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:51.100]   of science, exploring the outer—all right, I don't want to detract from it, but I say
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:56.740]   put it by the side of this, and it's a mere nothing, nothing at all.
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.740]   Look at it.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.740]   Here it is.
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.740]   Look into that manger.
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:00.740]   Look at that babe.
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:10.980]   He is the image of the invisible God, the exact likeness of the eternal and everlasting
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.980]   Father.
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.660]   All right, wait a minute, but he goes on.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.380]   You see, you can take no risks in these matters.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:23.300]   These false teachers who sound so clever and so plausible, you've only to examine what
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:29.660]   they say, bring them to the Scriptures, and you'll soon be able to explore their self-histories.
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.260]   Who is the image of the invisible God?
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.780]   And then, "the firstborn of every creature."
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.780]   What does this mean?
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.100]   Well, this authorized translation here is not quite as good as it could be.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.660]   Indeed, it's almost misleading.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.100]   People have often misunderstood it.
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.060]   The firstborn of every creature.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.300]   They say, "Well, that just means that he is the first creature to be born.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.340]   He is the first of a succession of creatures."
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.020]   It actually means the exact opposite.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.700]   Let me say this for the New English Bible.
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.180]   It does this very well.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:07.180]   It says, "His is the primacy over all created things, and in its margin, he is born before
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.860]   all created things."
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:09.860]   That's much better.
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:15.860]   Or take other translations, "He is the one who has priority to and over all creation."
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:20.900]   Or take another, "He is the firstborn before every creature."
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:27.360]   Now, these are vital statements, of course, and we must be quite clear about them.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.860]   This word translated here, "firstborn," implies a priority.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.380]   We are interested in priorities.
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.100]   Very well, he has a priority.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.900]   It conveys the notion of priority and of sovereignty at the same time.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.740]   He is before and he is over.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:49.620]   The firstborn who has the primacy over all creation.
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:56.740]   Now this is a very vital statement, you see, because what it tells us is this, that he
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:03.220]   existed before all created things.
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:07.340]   He is the firstborn of all creation, every creature.
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:12.460]   Very well, if he is before everything that is created, it is obvious that he himself
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.500]   is not created.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.660]   And that at once puts him into a category on his own, and that gives the lie direct
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.840]   to all who argue that he is the highest and the greatest of all created beings.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.160]   He is not created.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.700]   He is before everything that is created.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:37.700]   That means that he is uncreated, and that means that he is therefore eternal.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.220]   Now this is the statement, therefore, that is made by the Apostle, who is the image of
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.740]   the invisible God.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:51.980]   The firstborn of every creature, who has primacy over all created things.
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:57.180]   But then put with that the 19th verse, we are looking at his person, "For it pleased
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.420]   the Father that in him should all fullness dwell."
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:06.300]   The word "the Father" is supplied here by the translators, "It pleased that in him should
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.860]   all the fullness dwell."
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.540]   All the fullness of what?
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.780]   And the answer is all the fullness of the Godhead.
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:20.660]   Now the Apostle, of course, says that quite explicitly in the next chapter in verse 9.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:29.120]   He says, "For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.260]   This is the way to approach Christmas.
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.660]   Go to that stable, look into the manger.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:39.800]   There's a helpless babe, yes, but remember, all the fullness of the Godhead is in that
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.980]   little body.
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.580]   He is the sum total of all the divine attributes and powers.
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.020]   That's what the Apostle claims for him.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:56.100]   That is what he says is the truth about him, that he has primacy over everything that is
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.100]   created.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.100]   Why?
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.820]   Well, because he is God, God the Son.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.500]   All the fullness dwells in him.
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.900]   The authorized translators are perfectly right, everybody agrees about that.
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:12.260]   The idea conveyed by the Apostle was that it pleased God the Father that in him should
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.660]   all this fullness dwell.
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.380]   He sends his own Son, in other words.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.380]   And the Son has all the fullness of the Godhead in him.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:23.780]   In other words, his claim is that he is to have the preeminence because he's not a creature
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.860]   like all the rest.
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:30.900]   He is not merely the first in time and rank of a succession that's to follow.
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.800]   That was called the Arian heresy of the early centuries.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.000]   It troubled the early church.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.420]   They denounced it as heresy and they put an end to it, but it comes back in different forms.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.700]   And as I've reminded you, it's coming back today.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:52.140]   So he is the eternal Son of God, co-equal, co-eternal with the Father.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:57.220]   He's not just the brightest and the greatest of the angels.
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.060]   He's before every angel.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.500]   Now I read that first chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews at the beginning in order that
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.740]   we should all be perfectly clear about this.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.380]   That's an extended exposition of the thing we're looking at here.
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.060]   He takes it up, you see, and he says, "To which of the angels did God at any time say
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.060]   this and that?
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:19.100]   To which of the angels did he ever say, 'Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?'"
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.100]   Never.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.780]   They're all created beings.
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.460]   The angels, the angelic hosts, have all been created.
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.740]   There was a time when they were not.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.340]   They've been brought into being, and they've been brought into being in order to be God's
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.340]   servants.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.540]   They are ministering spirits.
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:33.860]   He's not one of them.
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:39.340]   "Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever."
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.700]   There's no beginning to him.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.740]   "He's before the skies, the heavens, they'll all be rolled up as a cloth.
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.740]   He abides."
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.740]   Why?
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.500]   Well, because he always was, without beginning or end of days.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.340]   He's not a created being, not even an angel.
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.620]   He's beyond that.
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:01.980]   He is God's only begotten, beloved Son.
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:08.020]   He is God's only Son, eternally generated by the—I don't understand that, says somebody.
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.020]   Of course you don't.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.020]   Who does?
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.020]   How can men?
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.020]   This is a great mystery.
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.140]   We are simply confined to what has been revealed to us.
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.900]   And what has been revealed to us is this, that this Son is God, as the Father is God,
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:28.600]   as the Spirit is God, three persons, but one God and eternal.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   Very well.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.380]   There is the first reason.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:39.420]   He must be given the pre-eminence because he is who he is, and he is the eternal Son
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:48.820]   of God, begotten, not created, begotten, begotten of the Father, his only Son, his only begotten
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.820]   Son.
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.740]   "Very well," I say, "let's put him in the category alone.
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.740]   There's nobody like him.
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:54.740]   There never has been.
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:55.740]   There never can be.
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:56.740]   He's there alone.
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.000]   Give him the pre-eminence.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.900]   He's God in the flesh.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:09.460]   He's not man only, he's not angel, he's God in the flesh, God, the second person in the
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.860]   blessed holy trinity, come down on earth to dwell with us.
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:14.860]   Let us worship him.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:15.860]   Let us adore him.
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:19.740]   Let us say that he's alone, that he's unique, there's nobody like him.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:23.300]   Give him the pre-eminence because he is who and what he is.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.820]   But come, let me come to the second argument.
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:31.360]   "He is to have the pre-eminence also," says the Apostle, "because of his relation to the
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.360]   universe."
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:40.120]   Listen to him saying that, "For by him," he says, "were all things created that are in
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:46.040]   heaven, that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.040]   or powers.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:53.240]   All things were created by him and for him, and he is before all things, and by him all
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.060]   things consist."
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.840]   What a statement.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.040]   All I can do is to give you some headings about it, my friend, and to plead with you
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.720]   to go home and think about it and meditate upon it.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.560]   This is his relationship to creation.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.360]   And here's a second reason why he must be given the pre-eminence.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.360]   What does it say?
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.360]   Well, look at it like this.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:19.200]   "By him," he says, "all things were created."
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.360]   That really means "in him" and "through him."
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.080]   Now this is a statement, of course, with which we are all familiar.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.160]   However ignorant people may be today of the Scriptures, they all know the beginning of
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.640]   the Gospel of John.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:39.360]   "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.820]   The same was in the beginning with God," that's what I've been saying.
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:48.040]   Listen, "all things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.040]   made.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:55.640]   In him was life, and the life was the light of men."
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:00.360]   Did you notice it in the epistle to the Hebrews, the second verse of the whole epistle?
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:06.320]   "He hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:15.720]   all things, by whom also he made the worlds by him."
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   What does this mean?
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:22.780]   Well, this is something, you see, that proves the previous statement that I've made.
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:28.900]   It has substantiated our exposition of the firstborn of every creature.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:34.540]   Not only is he not a created creature, it is through him that every created creature
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.220]   has been created.
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.020]   He can't be the two things at the same time.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:45.740]   It is in him and through him that everything that is created has been created.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.940]   Don't ask me to explain it.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:54.340]   All I know is this, that when the Father came to create, he did it through him, by means
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.020]   of him.
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:00.860]   He was somehow the agency of creation.
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:04.260]   That is, you see, he was before creation when there was nothing.
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.900]   And when the Father decided to create, he said to the Son, "Now then, I'm going to
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.940]   do all this through you."
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.100]   He was with the Father before anything was created.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.540]   And the result is that everything that has come into being has come into being through
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:23.380]   him, and then he gives us this extraordinary classification.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:29.900]   Everything he says that is in heaven, everything that is on earth.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.700]   Everything that is visible, everything that is invisible.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.340]   No, you can't add to that, can you?
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.820]   That includes everything.
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:42.300]   Heaven, earth, visible, invisible.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:50.500]   Material things, immaterial things, substantial things, spiritual things, things belonging
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.900]   to time, things belonging to eternity.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:58.540]   Here they are, they were all made and created in him and through him.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:03.700]   The last universe, which we see and which we are exploring, all the flowers, the mountains,
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.740]   the rivers, the animals, man, everything, all was made in him.
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:13.620]   Ah yes, but there is an invisible realm, there are these angels, spirits, angelic beings,
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.300]   all they also were created in him and through him.
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.940]   And in order that we might be quite clear about this, and not imagine that he is but
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.620]   one of these angels and these great powers, he puts it like this.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:27.900]   In him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.900]   invisible.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.220]   What do you mean by invisible, says somebody?
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:34.980]   Well, I'll tell you, says Paul, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.780]   or powers.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:46.020]   And there is an exhaustive and all-inclusive term that takes into itself all the angelic
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:52.980]   hosts and powers, whether they be angels or archangels or whatever you like.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:29:00.220]   They were all made and created in him and through him.
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:04.900]   And then, knowing our propensity to listen to error and to lies and to think that it's
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.880]   better than the truth, he comes back at the end of verse 16 and says, "All things were
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.780]   created by him, through him."
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:17.820]   He starts by saying it, he ends by saying it.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:24.700]   I trust therefore, my dear friends, that it comes on to all of us, that everything in
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:34.380]   the whole cosmos was created through and in this blessed person.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:41.420]   But then you notice the apostle goes on and says this, "All things were created through
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:45.060]   him and for him."
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.060]   What does that mean?
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.940]   Well, I confess that I don't know exactly.
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.180]   I've read everybody I can read on it, and they don't know, but it seems to me that it
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:30:02.180]   means something like this, "All things were created through him and for him."
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.660]   People often ask me this question.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:09.700]   They say, "If you believe in God, and if you say God is the creator, why did he ever create
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.100]   the world?"
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.420]   I think this is the answer.
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:19.140]   He created it for his son.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.460]   God is the father.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:30.500]   And human fathers often do the same kind of thing that God did when he created everything.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:35.420]   The father likes to make something that will please his son.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.780]   Something for the son to have as his own.
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.220]   Something for the son to play with and to enjoy.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.340]   Something for himself.
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:46.500]   I believe the apostle is telling us here that God created the whole universe for his son,
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.720]   gave it to him as a gift.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.860]   It is in that sense that everything is made through him and everything is made for him.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.320]   Everything is made with that intent that it may minister to his glory.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:05.740]   It is in order that he might be manifested in his glory that God made the universe.
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:09.980]   It's the topmost point of spiritual speculation.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.540]   But in the case of the apostle, it wasn't speculation.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.940]   He was writing under divine inspiration.
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.940]   And there it is.
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:21.340]   All things were created by him and they were created for him.
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.620]   God made the cosmos for his son.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:29.700]   And you can see that it is through this cosmos that we have come to know what we do know
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.340]   about this son.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:37.220]   And this is the reason why we should give him the preeminence always and in all things.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:42.980]   But come let's go a step further.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.460]   The apostle again sums it all up in verse 17.
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:51.340]   And he says he is before all things.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.100]   All created things have come after him.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:57.220]   He was before them because he is uncreated, because he exists eternally in the bosom of
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.220]   the Father.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.220]   And he is before all things.
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.780]   And listen to this.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:05.860]   And by him all things consist.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.980]   What's that?
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.300]   I wonder whether there is anybody in this congregation who is feeling a little bit disappointed
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.860]   and unhappy tonight.
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:20.580]   Did you come here saying, "Well, now, of course, Christmas is generally pretty heavy,
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.060]   but of course, tonight is bound to be simple.
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.060]   Christmas spirit.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:29.320]   We're going to have something wonderful tonight about the babe of Bethlehem."
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.980]   Are you feeling like that, my friend?
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.180]   Well, I'm sorry for you if you are.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:38.760]   You see, that babe of Bethlehem means nothing to you if you don't know something about this.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.060]   What he's saying is this, that it is that babe in Bethlehem in that manger that keeps
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:47.340]   the whole universe together.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.940]   By him all things consist.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.620]   Let me give you the exact meaning of the word.
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:59.860]   It means this, to cohere, to hold together.
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:05.580]   This is the meaning of the unity and the solidarity of the whole universe, the cosmos.
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.140]   There's nothing more scientific than the birth of the babe in Bethlehem.
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.260]   Here is science for you, at its very best.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.980]   What is the great characteristic of this universe in which we find ourselves?
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.340]   Isn't it this cohesion?
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:22.300]   This universe in which you and I find ourselves is not a chaos, it's a cosmos.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:27.600]   And a cosmos means that everything hangs together, that everything is held together.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.060]   That's what makes scientific investigation possible, because there are rules, there are
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.060]   laws.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.340]   Look at that tremendous activity within the atom.
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:39.680]   It's yet all held together, so that until recently they said that an atom was indivisible.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.900]   It was because of this cohesion.
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:46.860]   But there's this tremendous power, this force, the ion, the electron, they're all playing
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.500]   and yet they're all held together.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.700]   What is it that holds them together?
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.620]   The answer Paul gives is Christ.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.540]   He holds the whole universe together.
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.620]   The whole universe is held together.
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.260]   Everything depends upon everything else.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:05.980]   There is this marvelous order, this system, this arrangement, this design, this repetition.
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:06.980]   Why?
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.660]   Well, it's an ordered universe, it's a cosmos, it's a chaos.
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:16.180]   That is why we must reject the most idiotic sophistry, the theory of those who tell us
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:20.280]   that all this has come into being by accident.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:25.300]   I say that an atom alone is enough to disprove that, the way it all holds together.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.620]   There's only one explanation.
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.260]   He is holding it together.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.940]   He sustains it all.
[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:34.820]   He is the explanation of the perfect order and the interdependence that we find everywhere
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:35.820]   in nature.
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:45.300]   Very well then, let's leave it at that and let's put it like this in my second principle.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:51.060]   He is to have the preeminence because of his relationship to nature.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:55.220]   He is before it all, he is sovereign over it all.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:58.780]   He brought it into being, he holds it all together.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:02.140]   Without him it would dissolve and collapse.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.900]   Very well, give him the preeminence, my friend.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:11.420]   There is eternal son of God, yes, and this is his relationship to the whole of creation,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:15.380]   the whole of nature, the entire cosmos.
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.980]   But we've got to go on.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:23.580]   Having said all that, he goes on to say, and he is the head of the body of the church,
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:30.940]   who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he may have the preeminence.
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:36.140]   This is the third reason then for giving him the preeminence, that he, as he is eternal
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:42.060]   son of God, as he is supreme and sovereign in the whole universe, he is also the head
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:45.060]   of the body which is the church.
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.180]   Now this is something different.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:51.180]   This is something additional.
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.220]   He always was the son of God.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:36:03.260]   It was in him creation took place, way back at the beginning, whenever it was.
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:08.180]   But here is something new, something additional.
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.820]   Now we are looking at something that doesn't belong to eternity but to time.
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:16.620]   There was a time when there was no church.
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.860]   But he is the head of the church, the body which is the church.
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:25.740]   Now, here is the peculiar message, of course, of Christmas.
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.460]   He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning.
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.460]   The beginning of what?
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.420]   The beginning of the church.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.700]   He has brought the church into being.
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.900]   There would be no church without him.
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.900]   Here is the reason then for giving him further preeminence.
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:47.380]   He is the real and the only explanation of the existence of the church.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:54.900]   This is the real meaning also of what happened, I say, at that first Christmas.
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.180]   He is the beginning of the church.
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.620]   He is the head of the church.
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.100]   He is the life of the church.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.700]   He is the power of the church.
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.420]   He is the subsistence of the church.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.420]   He is everything.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.540]   Now, what does he mean by this?
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:10.060]   Well, what he means is this.
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.300]   The church has come out of him.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.300]   There could be no church without him.
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.300]   How?
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.940]   Well, here it is.
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:26.900]   He came from heaven and from the glory into this world in order to form the church.
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.420]   You can't be a Christian without belonging to the church.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.100]   I didn't say a particular local church.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:37.220]   I said the church, which is his body.
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.340]   He saves the church.
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.900]   He saves his people.
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:44.580]   And he is the beginning, the source, the origin, the fount of the church and her life, and
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.580]   he sustains it.
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:49.540]   He is everything to the church.
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.660]   How has the church come into being?
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.780]   Here is a wonderful thing.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:58.100]   Here is a new humanity that's going to people the new earth and the new heavens which are
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.820]   coming.
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.060]   This is how God redeems humanity and human nature.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.900]   Old humanity has gone wrong in Adam.
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:06.900]   We've considered that.
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.900]   It's hopeless.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:11.700]   God's starting a new humanity, so he sends a new man.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.380]   He's the first of the new humanity.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.980]   There was none of this new humanity until the babe of Bethlehem was born.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.060]   There's a new man.
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.060]   There is a second man.
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.060]   Adam was the first.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.060]   Here's the second.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.300]   Adam was the first Adam.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.300]   Here's the last Adam.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.300]   Here's a new man.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.460]   There's never been anything like him before.
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.460]   He's the first in this succession.
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:34.060]   That's why he must have the preeminence in this respect.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.780]   But you see what it involved.
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.840]   It involved his being born like a babe in Bethlehem.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:46.180]   It involved the fact that the eternal creator should become a helpless babe and be made
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.460]   flesh.
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:55.020]   It not only involved his incarnation, it involved his passion, his death upon the cross.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.060]   It involved, likewise, his resurrection.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.740]   Now then, let me summarise it like this.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:06.660]   He is the first, the originator of this new humanity, this new succession of people.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:11.740]   There he is, the first, the babe.
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:17.900]   Here is the first man who has ever perfectly kept God's law and honoured it in its every
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.740]   detail.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:28.220]   Here is the only one who could bear the load of the guilt of the world's sin and really
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:33.860]   bear it in the sense that he could carry it away and still go on himself.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:34.860]   The only one.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.120]   He came to do that.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:43.980]   And as the apostle reminds us, who is the beginning, the first born from the dead.
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:50.260]   Here is the first who has passed through death and come out the other side.
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:54.600]   Many people have died before him, nobody had resurrected from the dead before.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.980]   He is the first born from the dead.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:02.940]   Here is the first to conquer death and the grave, finally, and rise triumphant over it
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.860]   so that it can't touch him any more.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.700]   The first.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:15.260]   And he ascended into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of God.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:22.980]   The first new man, the first to give God's law perfect obedience, the one and only person
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:30.340]   who could make atonement, the first born and begotten from the dead, the first to enter
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.780]   and take his seat at the right hand of God.
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:38.260]   He alone has done that.
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:42.900]   And he has done it, and he has done it for the church.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:48.720]   And therefore he is the head of the church, and he alone is the head of the church.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:53.220]   And for that he should be given the preeminence as the great apostle.
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:59.460]   Very well, you see, we review his whole coming and going in a flash, and we see that he and
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:03.660]   he alone could ever have done this, and he has done it, "Give him the preeminence and
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:08.660]   the glory," says the apostle.
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:18.340]   I add one word to this, "Give him the preeminence also because of his all-sufficiency."
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.460]   What do you mean, says someone?
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:27.120]   Well, I mean this, that in all things he might have the preeminence.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.500]   Don't put anybody near him, says Paul.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.380]   Don't add anybody to him.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.820]   He's done it all, he's done it alone.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:43.340]   He needs no assistance, he requires no help, his work does not need to be supplemented.
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:46.700]   That had to be said in these early days by Paul to the Colossians.
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.780]   It has to be said tonight, let me say it.
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:56.500]   This person, that babe of Bethlehem, who grew to be a man and who preached and worked miracles,
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:02.260]   who died on the cross, was buried and put in a grave, and who rose again and ascended,
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:07.500]   he did everything that needs to be done for our salvation.
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.040]   He left nothing undone.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.300]   He did it all, he did it alone.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:18.420]   Born alone, misunderstood, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief in his life, a lonely
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.420]   man.
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:25.000]   He died, he trod the winepress alone, nobody with him.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.660]   He did it all himself, no one could help him.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:33.780]   He arose alone, he ascended to heaven alone, and then he took his seat at the right hand
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.160]   of the Father in the glory.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:39.580]   He did it alone, he needs no help, he needs no assistance, he needs no supplement.
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:47.780]   I say it in his name and to his glory, Mary, his mother, can't add to what he's done.
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:52.700]   She is no co-redemptrix, he needs no co-redemptor.
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:57.220]   He is the redeemer, and he is it alone.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:01.680]   You needn't pray to Mary, go to him, he's done everything, he's all and all in himself.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:07.240]   Give him all the preeminence, by going to Mary you're taking from his preeminence.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.660]   Don't add the saints to him, don't pray to saints, pray to him.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.280]   He's all, he's everything, he's all sufficient.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:18.360]   He is one, he is everything, he's the beginning, he's the end, the alpha, the omega, the all
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.360]   and in all.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.520]   Don't add to him, you're detracting from him, he needs no assistance.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:29.140]   The all things are included in this preeminence.
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:34.680]   So shame upon you, Christian people, if you dabble with these modern cults and think they
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.080]   can help you, or add to you.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.000]   If you go to them for help, you're taking from his preeminence.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.040]   He's enough, he's alone, he's everything.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.600]   He is the all and in all in himself.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:52.360]   I say his all-sufficiency is the ultimate cause of why we should give him the preeminence
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:55.440]   in all things.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:01.520]   There is none other name under heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:06.720]   It's the only name, there is no other, there's no second, there never can be.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:12.440]   He's alone, God and man, he's done all, created everything, holds everything together.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:17.200]   The head of the church, he came, he lived, he died, he rose again, he's done it all,
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.520]   and he did it all alone.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:33.400]   And therefore says the apostle in all things, he must have the preeminence.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:39.040]   Very well my friend, I end with a question.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:44.640]   Are you giving him the preeminence?
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:50.680]   What can I give him, said the question, what have I got to offer?
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.800]   That's all he wants.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:59.840]   That you and I give him the preeminence in all things.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:06.000]   That we look at him and say, my Lord and my God.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.260]   That you're in no doubt about what happened at Bethlehem.
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:18.020]   That you say, yes, you are the eternal Son of God, the image of the invisible God.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:25.940]   And you were born miraculously of a virgin, the Word was made flesh.
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:31.420]   You go to him and fall at his feet and say, I don't regard you as a man, only a great
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:38.460]   teacher or a great exemplar, thou art God, who didst leave the courts of heaven and come
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:43.780]   on earth into this sinful, evil world for me.
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:50.920]   You give him the preeminence in his Godhead, you give him preeminence as your Savior.
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:57.660]   You give him the preeminence by saying that you're a vile, a hopeless, a lost, a damned
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:00.700]   sinner.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:06.840]   And that you believe that this Son of God came into the world in order to save you.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:12.220]   It means you say to him, I couldn't save myself, I can't save myself.
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.480]   I thought I could, I see now I cannot.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.140]   I thought my good works would do it, I see they cannot.
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:19.940]   Nobody else can help me, they can't save themselves.
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:22.500]   Thou must save and thou alone.
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:26.900]   Nothing in my hands I bring, simply to thy cross I cling.
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:28.380]   That's what you say to him.
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:36.980]   Could my zeal nor respite now, could my tears forever flow, all for sin could not atone.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.500]   Thou must save and thou alone.
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.100]   You tell him that and you say, I believe you've done it.
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.740]   I believe you loved me and gave yourself for me.
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.420]   I believe you came from heaven into this world for me.
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:52.860]   Vile, damned sinner that I was, you took unto you human nature and flesh, that you might
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:57.140]   die for me.
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.420]   I believe it.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:08.700]   I rely on nothing and on no one but on thee, who has done all this for me.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:12.260]   That's the way to give him the preeminence.
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:16.620]   And you turn to him and say, because you are who you are and because you've done what you've
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.060]   done, I give myself to thee.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:25.980]   You say with Count Zinzendorf, thou must done that for me.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:28.780]   What can I do for thee?
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:34.540]   And all he says is this, give me thine heart, O my son, my daughter.
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:38.380]   All I want is the praise of your heart such as it is.
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:44.820]   Give it him, my friends, give him the preeminence, live for him, praise him, tell others about
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:45.820]   him.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:51.140]   And as you do so, you'll give him great joy.
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:57.820]   You will be giving him the preeminence that is his by right of who he is and by right
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:03.820]   of creation and by right of sustaining and causing everything to go here, by right of
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:07.540]   what he's done in the incarnation and in his death and resurrection.
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:14.500]   It is his, and he'll have it, and the whole world will be compelled to give it to him.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:20.940]   But give it him voluntarily, give it to him willingly.
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.620]   Look at him in Bethlehem.
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.460]   Look at him in the silent years in Nazareth.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.060]   Look at him in his public ministry.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.480]   Look at him in his deeds and acts of kindness and of power.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:38.300]   Look at him bleeding and dying and expiring on the cruel cross.
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:41.660]   Look at him buried dead and the stone rolled on the grave.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:47.340]   Look at him rising, triumphant and glorious, ascending, seating himself at the right hand
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:56.820]   of the majesty on high, and fall at his feet and say, "Thou art preeminent, thou art alone,
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:02.540]   thou art above and beyond all others, thou art to me the lily of the valley, the bright
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:07.940]   the morning star, thou art the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:15.860]   Yea, let all that is within me bless and praise his holy name.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:29.580]   My friends, look at him, and in all things give him the preeminence, amen.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:33.500]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
