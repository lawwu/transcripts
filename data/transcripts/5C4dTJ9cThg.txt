[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.100]   - In the last podcast, we talked about Adam's singleness
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.620]   and why it was not good.
[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.100]   And of course, this raises the question
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.100]   of whether singleness itself is intrinsically bad.
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.340]   What would you say to singles,
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.000]   especially to those who may be called
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.540]   to a life of singleness, Pastor John?
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.580]   - No, I wrote two chapters on singleness
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.900]   in my book on marriage.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.500]   And the reason I did it is because I knew
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.760]   that if you're gonna celebrate marriage,
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.440]   you're gonna have single people reading it and saying,
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.440]   oh, so that's the great life, and I get the other life.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.780]   And my point there was, no, there are glories
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.760]   that can be shown in marriage
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.040]   that can't be shown in singleness, given.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.000]   There are glories that can't be shown in marriage,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.720]   but only in singleness, given.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.080]   If God has called you to a life of singleness,
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.960]   there are ways in and by that singleness
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.960]   to display the glory of God, which married people can't.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.280]   It does involve other people.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.720]   So my point stays the same.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.200]   God created the other.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.760]   And I said other partly because I knew
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.840]   that it's not just wife, it's not just husband,
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.760]   it is other human.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.940]   And single people are called into a life
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.920]   of receive one another as Christ received you
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.680]   so that with one voice you may glorify him.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.680]   That is talking about the true eternal family.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.180]   And one of the things I stressed in those chapters was,
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.060]   marriage is temporary, the church is eternal.
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.060]   So the relationships we form in the church
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.180]   with brothers and sisters who may be single last forever.
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.880]   The relationship between a man and a woman in marriage
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.840]   doesn't, Jesus went out of his way to say,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.800]   in the resurrection there is neither marrying
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.320]   nor giving in marriage, which is why my dad
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.560]   will not be a bigamist in heaven,
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.560]   even though he had successive wives.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.360]   36 years with my mom, 25 years with my stepmom.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.000]   He answered that question by saying,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.460]   there won't be any marriage or giving in marriage.
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.180]   So thank you Tony for the clarifying question.
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.180]   Yes, singleness doesn't mean one has embraced
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.140]   a lesser life because there are ways to display
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.540]   the corporate glory and the glory of dependence on God
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.560]   in unique ways in singleness that can't be done
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.840]   by husband and wife.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.700]   - Thank you Pastor John.
