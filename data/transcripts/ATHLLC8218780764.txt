[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.560]   - Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.520]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.520]   If you're new here, I'm your host Chris Hutchins
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.720]   and one of the areas I love optimizing the most is travel.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.120]   I've been to 60 plus countries and on every trip,
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.720]   I love meeting locals, trying to understand their culture,
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.200]   having authentic experiences and most of all,
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.680]   I love finding a way to eat all the best foods
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.000]   a place has to offer.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.720]   And hands down, one of my favorite travel destinations
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.140]   in the world is Japan.
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.880]   So I wanted to do another travel episode
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.440]   on just traveling there.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.140]   And while I've been there four times,
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.720]   there is no one better to join me
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.960]   than my previous guest, Brandon Presser,
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.220]   who's been there every year for the past 20 years,
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.640]   except 2021, including spending a month there last November.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.980]   He's also lived there twice
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.680]   and he's written three books on the country.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.800]   He is a true expert on Japan,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.360]   but he's also been to over a hundred countries
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.520]   and written well over 50 guidebooks.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.600]   So he is actually an all around travel pro as well.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.080]   We're gonna talk about why we both love the country so much,
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.180]   what makes it worth a visit, where you should go,
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.760]   what you should see and do, and my favorite,
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.680]   all the incredible foods you should be trying
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.760]   and our favorite spots to eat them.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.800]   I hope that by the time you finish this episode,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.260]   whether you've never been to Japan,
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.060]   have a trip on the horizon or have been before,
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.000]   you're gonna be inspired to go there soon
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.160]   and have a ton of amazing new things to check out
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.140]   when you get there.
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.540]   So let's get into it right after this.
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.120]   Do you all remember episode 122,
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.440]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.600]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.620]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.560]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.000]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.840]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.480]   from Anyday, I am a total convert
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.580]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.880]   for this episode.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.920]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.180]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.540]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.540]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.140]   The cookware is 100% plastic free
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.100]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.260]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.460]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.100]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.280]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection,
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.580]   so you should definitely check that out.

[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.460]   Brandon, thank you so much for being here a second time.
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.660]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.980]   You've traveled to so many countries.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.640]   What is it about Japan that keeps bringing you back?
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.380]   So the thing about Japan for me
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.980]   is that the more time you spend there,
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.100]   the more you realize you don't know the destination that well
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.660]   and every time I go back,
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.040]   there's always a new thing to explore.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.180]   There's always a theme that needs unpacking
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.420]   and it's one of those places that it's not like in New York
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.380]   where you get to live there for 10 years
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.620]   and then you get to say you're a New Yorker.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.380]   The more time you spend, the more you're like,
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.580]   wow, I'm not from here.
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.220]   This is coming from someone who's lived there twice
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.020]   and been there like well over a dozen times.
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.220]   So that's wild.
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.940]   What is so different about Japan?
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.940]   I've heard a lot of people call Japan a Galapagos economy.
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.860]   What that essentially means is that it's a country
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.180]   that has modernized and evolved
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.620]   away from the rest of the world.
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.120]   So a lot of the systems that are in place,
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.420]   a lot of the ways that we perceive the modern world
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.380]   are just slightly alternate universe
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.700]   and I think that's what makes Japan
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.860]   so interesting and special.
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.340]   - Can you give some examples?
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.260]   - Absolutely.
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.940]   One of the most important things to note
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.860]   about Japan and Japanese culture
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.060]   is that they have this proclivity
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.540]   for taking something from another country
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.500]   and then improving upon it.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.940]   And so ramen is the best example of that.
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.940]   So it's a Chinese dish,
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.260]   became really popular after World War II,
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.060]   was called Chinese noodles
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.820]   and then the recipe started to change
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.060]   and started to evolve.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.340]   And then it became ramen,
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.500]   which we all conceive of as distinctly Japanese.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.220]   And the other example is toilets brought by the West
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.760]   and as many of us know,
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.940]   they now can sing you happy birthday
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.300]   while you're using them
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.580]   and have all sorts of water features.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.420]   - Yeah.
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.240]   Have a Japanese toilet.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.660]   We've talked about how to get a deal
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.740]   on a Japanese toilet on this show before.
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.580]   And I totally agree.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.040]   It's funny, I've been to Japan a few times
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.880]   and people are like,
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.260]   "Oh, you gotta check out this place for pizza."
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.300]   And I'm like, "Why would I get pizza in Japan?
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.140]   "That seems crazy."
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.980]   It's like, "No, no, no,
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.940]   "because Japan takes everything
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.020]   "and tries to make the best possible version you can of it."
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.380]   There was a pizzeria in Napolitana da Yuki
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.140]   in I think Kyoto.
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.180]   And the person who started it
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.340]   is like went to Italy, trained,
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.660]   brought back everything
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.860]   and like has tried to master the pizza
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.340]   in every way possible.
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.660]   And the same is true about coffee
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.280]   and the list goes on forever.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.240]   Whenever my wife and I come back, we're like,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.900]   "Feel like we just came back from the future
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.140]   "in this world where everything was improved
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.400]   "and thought of in a rational and logical way."
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.300]   So I am so excited to dig in here.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.020]   I'm so excited to go back to Japan.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.980]   You are one of the people I know
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.620]   who's been since it reopened.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.340]   What was it like in a kind of post-pandemic world?
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.780]   - Well, much in the way that Japan always feels
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.620]   like this wonderful trip to the future.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.540]   And I often, when I return from Japan,
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.060]   have sort of reverse culture shock
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.140]   when I get back to the US,
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.580]   I'm like, "Oh, this country's so disappointing
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.220]   "relative to Japan."
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.220]   What was interesting about my trip to Japan this time
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.020]   was it felt a little bit like a visit to the recent past.
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.060]   Their relationship with COVID
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.020]   has been very different than in the US.
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.100]   Everyone is still masking,
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.100]   even outdoors, even on a hike,
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.740]   I would pass people who are still wearing
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.500]   their masks outside.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.220]   And we can kind of dig into why that is
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.140]   and how certain cultural things kind of inform that.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.980]   But there is a lot of COVID fear.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.960]   When I was there, a lot of people asked me,
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.580]   "Is this your first trip out of America since the pandemic?"
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.540]   And I think Japan was maybe my 15th country
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.220]   since we've torn away the veil of the pandemic.
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.140]   So in that sense, it was this odd revisiting
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.900]   of the trauma of the pandemic and the fear.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.900]   But what's also really interesting about Japan
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.880]   is we're now post-Olympics.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.460]   And that is something to really consider as well,
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.420]   'cause it was sort of the Olympics that never happened.
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.620]   There were high hopes for the Games.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.140]   The last time that Japan had the Olympics was in 1964.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.420]   And that was really fascinating
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.820]   'cause it was the first Olympic Games
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.700]   that were televised around the world.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.500]   And it was to signal that Japan
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.180]   was this fresh, newly modern country post-World War II,
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.620]   a lot of really interesting modern architecture
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.500]   happening as the backdrop.
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.020]   So they were kind of hoping to replicate that magic.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.440]   And of course, that never happened.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.300]   But how the Olympics actually are informing Japan
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.660]   is we're seeing a lot of little Western tweaks.
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.420]   English is a lot better than it was a few years ago.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.660]   And we're also seeing much more credit card use
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.860]   than we did before.
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.140]   Little things like that.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.460]   - But things are open.
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.540]   You are able to go see stuff, do stuff,
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.540]   eat stuff, drink stuff.
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.300]   So just because there might be a feel
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.300]   like you're back in the past,
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.420]   I would say you could go to Japan right now
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.660]   and have an amazing experience
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.860]   and do all the things you'd done before.
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.540]   - Absolutely, I highly recommend it.
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.360]   If you're okay still wearing a mask, out of courtesy,
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.940]   I would get on the plane tomorrow
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.980]   and you're gonna have an absolutely incredible experience.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.940]   Everyone's excited for people to be coming back.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.140]   Restaurants are fully operational.
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.180]   You know, if you saw in the news,
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.780]   a lot of travel articles that were like,
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.780]   "Go before the crowds, get back to Japan before the crowds,"
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.920]   that's fake news.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.940]   The crowds are back in full force
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.700]   and Chinese tourists are gonna start heading back
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.740]   now as well.
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.500]   And even without the Chinese tourists
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.100]   who make up about 40 to 50% of the tourism in Japan,
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.480]   everything was rammed.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.700]   All the favorite temples in Kyoto were packed with people.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.500]   You absolutely needed reservations at popular restaurants.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.220]   So everything's back in full swing.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.140]   - Okay, well, let's talk about that trip.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.900]   When I did my first episode to London, I just picked a city.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.380]   I was like, "Oh, that's pretty easy."
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.620]   I'm getting a little ambitious here.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.540]   We're gonna talk about an entire country.
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.960]   So instead of trying to go through every destination
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.140]   in the country, that would be impossible.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.740]   We would have to record for the next, I don't know, week
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.060]   or based on your experience, maybe for the next 20 years.
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.940]   But let's say someone's thinking
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.460]   about how to take that first trip for one, two weeks.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.940]   What would you give them the advice of how to go,
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.320]   where to go, all of that?
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.140]   - Yeah, so I would think about trip planning to Japan
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.460]   the way that I think about trip planning
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.540]   to every destination.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.380]   Think of your trip as a meal.
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.420]   Think about you have your appetizer,
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.340]   your main course, and your dessert.
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.440]   So the appetizer is like you're getting into the vibe
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.100]   of the destination, you're doing a little sampling,
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.840]   maybe tasting a few things.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.580]   Really, you're getting over the jet lag.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.020]   And so when you, by the time you transition
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.060]   to the main course, that's like the real showstopper.
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.380]   That's the meat.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.500]   And then the dessert is gonna be the thing
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.340]   where you really treat yourself.
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:52.100]   Save that really fun, cool thing until the end.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.660]   And I'm not someone who suffers from FOMO,
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:00.660]   but I am sort of crippled by the optimizer's dilemma.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.500]   Like I wanna make sure that I've had
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.140]   the best trip possible for me.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.820]   And Japan is one of those places
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.500]   where there's just so many different variations
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.820]   on the theme.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.040]   I think the two places that you absolutely have to hit
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.260]   are Tokyo and Kyoto.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.460]   And then you can kind of mix and match
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.900]   a variety of secondary destinations
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.620]   based on your personal interest.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.940]   I wouldn't be a slave to,
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.440]   well, everyone else is going here,
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.860]   or everyone else is going there.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.220]   I think critically about what is interesting to you
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.660]   about Japan.
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.020]   And we're gonna go through some of those different
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.440]   destinations and themes and kind of pick a mix from there
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.660]   and then end with your splurge,
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.460]   where you're kind of really soaking in
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.180]   maybe a traditional inn, a ryokan,
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.980]   having that quintessential Japanese hospitality experience
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.780]   where you're not leaving the hotel,
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.780]   but just basking in that incredible design, food,
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.500]   everything that we know from the country.
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.580]   - Hospitality.
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.580]   - That omotenashi, yeah.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.780]   - Just high level, what are a few of those places
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.100]   outside of Tokyo and Kyoto that you'd put on the list?
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.460]   - I would think that you would wanna get
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.260]   four elements on your trip.
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.260]   You wanna do new, old, mountain, sea.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.380]   Those are the four things that I think
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.580]   that you should check off your list
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.980]   for every trip to Japan,
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.620]   whether it's your first or whether it's your fourth.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.860]   And old and new can be in different cities.
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.060]   They are always looking ahead into the future
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:41.060]   while also cherishing their cultural and historical relics.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.980]   And then you need to remember that Japan
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.300]   is on the Pacific Ring of Fire.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.140]   There are still active volcanoes.
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.580]   The country's incredibly hilly, mountainous,
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.780]   and then you have these beautiful sea moments,
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:02.780]   bays, lakes, and putting that all together is just perfect.
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.700]   - Are there specific places you're like, get to them,
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.140]   but here's a cool place, there's a cool place
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.140]   to get people excited?
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.660]   - Yeah, so think of Japan as having four major islands
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.740]   and Tokyo and Kyoto are on the main island, Honshu,
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.740]   and I would absolutely add one of the other islands
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.580]   to your itinerary.
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.060]   So Kyushu in the south, you're getting active volcanoes,
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.620]   you're getting onsen culture, this hot spring culture.
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.220]   This is a really hot emerging destination
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.100]   that I absolutely recommend.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.420]   Can give you some specifics a little later on.
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.100]   Shikoku is the quietest of the four.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.340]   These are small villages, a lot of farming,
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.100]   and that is where you're gonna really have
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.300]   that rural experience where you can go stay with a family
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.300]   and really embed in the culture in a very different,
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.420]   humble way, and then you have Hokkaido in the north.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.900]   Think of Japan as a lowercase J,
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.620]   Hokkaido is the dot at the top,
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.820]   and that is really famous internationally
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.500]   as a skiing destination, but I would challenge you
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.940]   to consider it as just a beautiful, natural destination
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.540]   and a place that's really worth going even in the summer
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.900]   for those mountains on steroids,
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.020]   these huge expanses of wilderness,
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.060]   but still with that Japanese sensibility.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:22.900]   - I love it.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.380]   Okay, we're gonna get to a lot of this.
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.700]   I'm very sad that I don't have a Japan trip on the horizon.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.620]   Best times, is there a time you think people
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.900]   should be planning their trip to Japan?
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.180]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.620]   I like to avoid the summer, and that is not necessarily
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.300]   because that's when you have the most crowds,
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.300]   but surely a lot of people in their summer holidays
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.740]   are gonna end up in Japan, but it is desperately humid.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.700]   When I used to live in Japan and I worked,
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.100]   my boss used to make me keep clothes at work
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.260]   so that after I would take the metro to the office,
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.860]   I would have fresh clothes to change into
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.780]   'cause I would inevitably be sweaty.
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.580]   July and August are upsettingly hot and humid,
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.700]   and so much of Japan, even though you're thinking about
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.500]   taking trains and all of this,
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.820]   so much is exploring by walking,
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.180]   so you wanna be comfortable.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.060]   Obviously, there's cherry blossom season
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.420]   that's world famous, and you're gonna get all of the crowds.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.420]   Is it worth the hype?
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.620]   Absolutely, it is totally stunning.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.580]   There are cherry blossoms all over the country.
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.700]   You don't necessarily need to be in Tokyo or Kyoto
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.540]   to see them.
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.580]   My favorite time to go is in the fall
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.340]   because in the way that cherry blossom season is revered,
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.580]   so is the fall in Koyo, as it's called, leaf peeping.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.900]   So you get these beautiful red Japanese maples.
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.100]   I think November for me is my favorite time to visit.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.100]   - We went in December 2019 with my family
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.140]   right before COVID came,
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.540]   and it was awesome because it wasn't that crowded,
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:51.820]   but it's not that cold.
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.820]   We didn't go to Hokkaido, it would've been cold,
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.500]   but in most of the rest of the country,
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.660]   it's not unbearably cold.
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.060]   It was a little cheaper because people aren't traveling
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.900]   in cold cities as much, but I had a great time.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.540]   It was a little easier to get into things.
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.100]   It wasn't that crowded.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.140]   Any other kind of high-level logistics?
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.820]   Do you think people need a guide?
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.460]   Someone wrote to me, and I'll ask you and share my opinion,
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.100]   but they were like, "Should they be nervous
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.260]   "if they only speak English?"
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.060]   Anything like that?
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.460]   - I think that the English has massively improved
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.780]   over the last 10 years,
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.660]   especially with the anticipated nudge of the Olympics.
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.420]   There were a lot of people that were taking English classes,
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.460]   and that has really changed.
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.060]   Does it compare to other countries?
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.380]   No, I think that there's still a lack of English
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.700]   compared to a place like Thailand, say.
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.980]   But I think you are gonna be fine going around on your own,
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.420]   and I think experiencing at least parts
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.740]   of your trip on your own is hugely rewarding,
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.780]   much more rewarding than in a lot of other destinations,
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.340]   simply because the quality of everything is so high
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.140]   that it's a destination that really lends itself
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.780]   to discovery.
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.020]   Walking into a random restaurant
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.940]   will probably be pretty darn good.
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.700]   - We've done Japan four times.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.820]   I speak like three words of Japanese,
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.140]   and we had no guides ever any of those times,
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.060]   so I typically tell people,
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.100]   "Look, you might need to speak a little slower.
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.060]   "You might need to point.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.140]   "You might need to just accept that you'd just be surprised."
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.260]   But I don't think there's a country in the world
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.820]   that I've found that you can't go to
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.060]   because you don't speak the language,
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.260]   so I don't think that should be a barrier for anyone,
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.700]   but I've gotten a bunch of emails asking if it is,
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.540]   so I wanted to make sure we cover it.
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.340]   And last, any tips you have,
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.700]   since you've been there so many times,
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.540]   to save money on setting everything up in advance?
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.980]   - Well, there's two things that I always think about
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.820]   when I'm planning a trip to Japan.
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:49.820]   I think we all wanna do a bit of pre-arrival research
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.460]   for some of our specifics.
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.780]   It's a country that is very crowded.
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.540]   It's a country that's getting a lot of tourists,
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.060]   so you do want to plan a little bit in advance
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.060]   as far as what you're gonna eat, where you're gonna stay.
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.540]   And one of the things that's very culturally different
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:09.100]   than Japan and the West is rating things,
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.620]   so giving stars on Google or on Yelp or things like that.
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:17.020]   In our culture, we're very hyperbolic.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.540]   We have a nice experience, we give it a five.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.340]   We have a bad experience, we give it a one.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.640]   Everything kind of always ends up netting out
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.780]   to be like a 4.2 or something like that at a place.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.380]   In Japan, you have a nice experience, you give it a three.
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.580]   So what can be really confusing at the onset
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.660]   is someone could tell you,
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.180]   "Oh my God, I love this restaurant.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.580]   "It's so great and cool," and you go onto Google
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.100]   to see the review that has been given,
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.860]   and its average is like a 3.6.
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:45.780]   And you're like, "What?
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.980]   "I would never eat at a place that's a 3.6."
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:52.980]   Well, in Japan, 3.6 is excellent.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.660]   And in the food category,
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.940]   I wanna send you right away to Tabalog.
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.700]   It's a website that is their Yelp,
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.740]   but it's taken very seriously.
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.540]   People use it prolifically,
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.540]   and with your translator button on,
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.020]   you can navigate it without any problems.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.660]   And you can search by type of food,
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.020]   and you can search by destination,
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.500]   and really make some informed decisions,
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.860]   bearing in mind that really stellar restaurants
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.740]   are gonna have a 3.8 or a 3.7.
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.480]   And then you can also use the rating
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.540]   to gauge where Japanese people are going
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.940]   and where tourists are going.
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.460]   And this goes for other things
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.140]   like hotels and sites and bars.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.700]   If it has kind of a low score,
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.300]   Japanese people are going there.
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.300]   If it has an inflated score,
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.180]   you know that it's more frequented by foreigners.
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.780]   - Funny, it's like you find a place on Google Maps,
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.780]   it's like 4.9, you're like, "Steer clear,
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.940]   "there's no way you got here."
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.300]   - Exactly, don't go here.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.340]   Only Americans are going there.
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.420]   - Oh, that's so funny.
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.660]   What about other things about the culture
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.540]   that people might wanna know about going there?
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.580]   How would you describe Japanese people
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.180]   and the culture and things people should be aware of?
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.800]   - Yeah, I wanna take a beat to talk about
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.940]   how we would relate to Japanese culture.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.500]   So a lot of people talk about
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.300]   how the Japanese hospitality is like no other,
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.180]   and there's this notion of a motonashi,
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.780]   which is service from the heart.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.180]   And I hear that buzzword a lot in luxury travel
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.140]   when I work with different hotels all over the world.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.620]   They wanna telegraph that they have
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.140]   this elevated sense of hospitality.
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.860]   But what you need to understand about Japanese culture
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:39.320]   is when you engage with a hospitality product,
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.280]   there's an unspoken social contract
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.560]   where you are also the deferential guest.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.600]   So the idea of the customer is always right
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.400]   doesn't really exist in Japanese culture.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.400]   You are expected to be as well-behaved
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.760]   and as nice as the restaurant staff will be to you.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.300]   And that is kind of a product of Japan
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:14.300]   being a culture of shame rather than a culture of guilt.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:19.140]   In the West, we think about Catholic guilt or Jewish guilt.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.820]   I think we all have a pretty good sense of what that means
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.460]   if we have all experienced it.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.380]   In Japan, it's more how everyone else is perceiving you.
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.540]   So you are kind of internalizing your own actions
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.740]   and making choices about your behavior
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.800]   based on how everyone else perceives you
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.620]   rather than that moral compass inside
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.300]   telling you what's right or wrong.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.420]   I know it's like a bit lofty,
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.180]   but you are working as a guest
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.580]   in the way that staff are working to serve you.
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.100]   - We were at a nice steakhouse in Tokyo once,
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.380]   and I remember one of us spilled
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.100]   our glass of wine on the table.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.220]   We'd been in Japan for a week
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.740]   and we had internalized this feeling you're describing.
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.580]   And it was like, oh my gosh,
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.820]   should we just leave the restaurant?
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.820]   Like, can we even stay here after that?
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.500]   We felt so horrible.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.140]   Everyone was kind of looking at us like,
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.660]   how could you do that?
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.540]   I feel like I know what you mean.
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.060]   Fortunately, we recovered, we apologized profusely,
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:13.900]   and it was okay.
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.220]   But I have experienced that feeling,
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.460]   and it's very different.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.540]   - You don't wanna be late.
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.480]   You don't wanna be late to your reservation.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.660]   You don't wanna be late to meet your guide.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.100]   And that's part of the social contract as well.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.620]   Also, you might find funny quirks
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.460]   where if you're staying at a luxury hotel
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.980]   and the staff wants to know
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.820]   what time you're gonna have breakfast in the morning,
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.340]   you could say, oh, I don't know, 9 a.m.
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:41.420]   But they might come back to you and say, 8.30 is better.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.720]   Don't be surprised if they are going to really hold you
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.860]   to that social contract and kind of tweak your experience.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.060]   But it's all so that they can serve you better.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.660]   - They're suggesting 8.30 'cause at nine it's crowded
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.100]   and you might not get the best table
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.640]   or your food might be slow or something like that.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.700]   And on the sense of punctuality,
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.100]   definitely don't be late to trains either.
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.140]   I can't remember the story,
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:09.020]   but it was like there was one train that left seconds late
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.420]   and they issued like a national apology.
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.100]   I'm sure you know this story better than me,
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.820]   but like things are not late.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.720]   - Yeah, so when I lived in Japan,
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.780]   I was working there and going to the office
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.660]   on days when a train would be late.
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.660]   By more than 10 seconds,
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.800]   they would issue you a little white slip of paper,
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.400]   if you needed it, that you could bring to your boss
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.240]   saying this is the reason that I'm late.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.740]   It is not my fault that I am late to work.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:40.640]   Everything is extremely on time to the point
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.720]   where I have had tourists reach out to me,
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.920]   friends reach out to me at Tokyo Station
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.600]   wanting to get on the bullet train.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.520]   They had bought tickets for their 9.30 bullet train
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.120]   to go to Kyoto, let's say.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.180]   And they're like, well, I'll get to the train station
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.560]   20 minutes before, but of course,
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.680]   Tokyo Station is one of the biggest stations in the world.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.840]   Takes about 20 minutes to get to your train
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.000]   and they missed it.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.980]   - So last thing on culture, is it easy to meet people?
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.960]   I think one of my favorite things traveling
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.320]   is meeting locals and I find in Japan,
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.680]   either I'm doing it wrong or it's harder to do.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.180]   - It's extremely difficult and I don't wanna oversimplify
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.120]   the nuance of cultures of shame
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.480]   versus cultures of guilt.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.720]   This is certainly nothing that we need to unpack
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.620]   more than that when we're trying to cram in
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.760]   a whole travel guide in about an hour.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.160]   But the idea is that because the social contract
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.740]   that you have with the people around you,
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.400]   it extends beyond hospitality.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.920]   It's why everyone is so polite on the trains.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.380]   It's why everyone walks on certain sides of the roads.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.280]   It's why Tokyo is the biggest city in the world
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:46.200]   but it feels more organized than any other city half its size.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.880]   The social contract sort of exists
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.400]   that you create this facade, this emote,
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.040]   where you have a side of yourself
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.120]   that you present to other people
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.500]   and then you have a more personal side
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.640]   and a more personal aspect to your personality.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.340]   So because there is this facade element,
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.360]   you are engaging with people in that manner.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.860]   Is it a fake facade?
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:10.700]   No.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:11.520]   Are they two-faced?
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.360]   No.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.600]   This is a true aspect of your personality
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.500]   but it's the presented aspect of your personality.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.860]   So it's hard to have that very American,
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.120]   this is how I really feel about something.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.120]   These are my real emotions.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.640]   Americans like to tell you when they're mad
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.200]   but they're screaming at you.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.280]   It's like, I get it that you're mad because you're yelling
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.320]   whereas the Japanese generally are much more nuanced
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.160]   in that nature.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.440]   So it's an interesting moment where two cultures
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.080]   are touching that may feel limited or inauthentic
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.000]   but it's just a different version
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.640]   of how we present ourselves.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.920]   - If you had a guide or you met someone
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.760]   that worked at your hotel and you're like,
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.880]   "Hey, do you wanna grab a drink tonight after work?"
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.800]   Would that be very surprising or shocking
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.720]   and met with a no?
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.900]   Or how might you go about introducing yourself to a local
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.120]   so you could get to know them
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.240]   and spend time in a casual setting?
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.160]   - Yeah, one of the things that I've discovered
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.700]   is there's actually a lot of opportunities
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.560]   to engage with people in structured ways
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.420]   that could end up leading to a friendship.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:19.040]   So a lot of towns all over Japan, including Tokyo,
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.800]   have free tours that you can sign up for.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.560]   And those tours are with young Japanese individuals
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.540]   who are motivated to take you around their neighborhood
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.880]   as an opportunity to practice their English
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.680]   or an opportunity to meet foreigners.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.520]   There are a lot of different websites that offer this
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.280]   and it's a great way to strike up a conversation
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.440]   with someone and use that tour opportunity
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.920]   to ask big questions because they are people
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.400]   that wanna engage with you.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.440]   And you can use it less as,
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.960]   "Oh, I wanna discover Shibuya in Tokyo and see cool things,"
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.000]   but more as an opportunity to have
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.320]   that budding friendship opportunity.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.400]   I would definitely try to do one of those.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.940]   - I love free walking tours.
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.680]   I think they're a great way to get your bearings,
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.460]   but especially in a culture where it's harder
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.040]   to meet someone just at a bar and strike up a conversation.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.400]   I think it's a great recommendation.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.680]   But you mentioned a few things in Tokyo.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.880]   I wanna make sure we get to what to do.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.920]   I think let's start here because I assume
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.120]   almost anyone going to Japan will probably,
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.600]   especially on their first trip, end up here.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.920]   It's one of the most amazing cities in the world.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.560]   How do you think about even trying to bring it all together
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.920]   and suggest people experience it?
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.760]   - One of the funny things that I've noticed about Tokyo
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.120]   is when you ask people where they're going on holiday,
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.200]   when they're referring to a European destination,
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.760]   they usually refer to it by city.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.960]   So, "Oh, I'm going to Paris on holiday.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.080]   "I'm going to London."
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.120]   When people talk about going to this country,
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.200]   they say Japan.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.360]   They don't say Tokyo for some strange reason.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.240]   I'm always trying to figure out why.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.840]   And I think it's because it's so far
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.240]   and it's a lot of people's first time
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.920]   they're gonna do things beyond Tokyo,
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.680]   which makes perfect sense.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.700]   But I really want you to spend more time in Tokyo
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.280]   than you think you need.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.840]   A trip that's three nights in Tokyo
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.000]   and three nights in Kyoto doesn't make sense to me.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.960]   It is a city that has 40 more times
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.600]   the population than Kyoto.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.880]   It's a city that's four times physically bigger than Kyoto.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.540]   So even just on pure numbers,
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.040]   you shouldn't weight Tokyo equal
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.320]   to anything else in the country.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.960]   It's a place that it has a Brooklyn.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.300]   Sure, do I need to go check out the Brooklyn?
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.600]   Sure, but there's like 12 Brooklyns.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   And it's just this infinitely large destination
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.820]   in all the best ways.
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:50.200]   And it can be really tough to dig in.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.000]   So my first thing that I always tell people
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.580]   when they're trying to figure out the city
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:59.940]   is to Google Yamanote Line Google Maps.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.120]   Don't go into Google Maps and Google it
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.240]   'cause it won't work,
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.640]   but just go to like your Google search bar
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.140]   and type Yamanote Line Google Maps.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.760]   And there's a bunch of people that have drawn
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.900]   the Yamanote Line within Tokyo.
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:18.900]   That is a Japan rail line that makes a circle
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:24.200]   around the central part of Tokyo.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:29.440]   Tokyo has 23 wards, which are kind of like boroughs.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.840]   And this line is like a really good way
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.120]   to conceive of the city geographically.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.360]   Now think of that as a clock.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.720]   Everything that when you hear that's like
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.260]   cool new neighborhood street fashion,
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.280]   even going back to like the early 2000s,
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.960]   like Harajuku girls and all of that,
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:54.960]   that happens at around seven to nine o'clock on the clock.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:00.860]   Then all of the older things like Shitamachi,
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.620]   all of the Sensoji Temple,
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.420]   a lot of sort of the older touch points
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:11.420]   happen around one and two o'clock on the clock.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.740]   And then you have the big stations
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.900]   like Shinjuku is at nine o'clock, Ginza,
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.560]   which has Tokyo Station just north of it,
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.980]   also a major hub, that's at like three o'clock.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.580]   That's a good place to start thinking
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.940]   geographically about the city.
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.020]   - Also, I will say, if you don't look at the Yamanote Line
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.620]   and you look at the entire subway map,
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.940]   it's just like sensory overload.
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.620]   It's very hard to understand.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.260]   There are multiple companies operating
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.940]   different rail lines in the city.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.940]   In some cities, I'm like, oh, look at the subway map.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.100]   It's a good way to orient yourself.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.780]   In Japan, I love the recommendation
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.660]   of just starting with the Yamanote Line
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.060]   because otherwise it could be pretty overwhelming.
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:54.900]   - Totally.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.860]   It really looks like fallen confetti in a way.
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.940]   It's all different colors.
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.020]   And what's curious about it is that unlike other cities,
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.780]   it is built from a few different companies.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:08.100]   So you have some municipal lines, the Tokyo Metro Line,
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.980]   then you have a second metro line,
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.100]   then you have suburban lines that were built
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:17.100]   from companies like a Sears or a Macy's.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.940]   So strangely, they share names
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.140]   with a lot of the department stores in Tokyo.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.540]   And you're gonna use one card
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.180]   to tap through many turnstiles
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.020]   if you're gonna go on a long trip
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.620]   all the way through the city.
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.660]   And 20 years ago, you used to have to get tickets
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.700]   for each one, which was an absolute nightmare.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.020]   So now, I believe it's still just the Suica card.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.820]   You used to have to get a physical one.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.100]   Since we won't go too much into travel logistics
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.140]   'cause it's pretty straightforward
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.220]   and the internet is full of information,
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.380]   I will just add that you can now get your Suica card
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.980]   on your iPhone or your phone in a digital wallet
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.540]   and you don't even need the physical card.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.740]   And you can reload it right there, it's super easy.
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.620]   I will say if you're on a budget,
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.020]   it is worth paying attention
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.980]   because I think it still is true, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.820]   that if you transfer from the, is it Toyose Line
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.660]   to the JR line, you're gonna pay multiple fares.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.780]   When you do a Google Maps search from A to B,
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.660]   it'll tell you how to get there and show you the prices.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.220]   And there might be a fast route
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.420]   and there might be a cheap route
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.340]   and they might be different
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.900]   because changing different lines
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.380]   may be on different companies and have multiple fares.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.460]   - That's a really good point.
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.820]   It's something that I think about when I'm there as well.
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.560]   If you're really focused on your budget
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.860]   and you're traveling, say, from the central part of the city
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:35.420]   to Shimokitazawa, which is a really trendy,
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.300]   perennially cool neighborhood,
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:42.700]   if you get off one station before Shimokitazawa
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.380]   at Yoyogi-Oehara, you save about two thirds
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.460]   of the fare to get there.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.700]   - And Google Maps is pretty good.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.020]   I don't know if there's a better app
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.460]   to find train from point A to point B.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.500]   I believe it also tells you the fares and everything.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.500]   That's what we used.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.800]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.300]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.900]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.540]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.940]   as you build your wealth.
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:13.220]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:16.060]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.220]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.300]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.740]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.140]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.100]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.420]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.540]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.900]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.620]   Now, the majority of Longangle members
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.420]   are first generation wealth,
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.500]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.660]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.980]   and learn from each other
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.580]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.860]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.200]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.620]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.780]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.760]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.240]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.680]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.340]   to your children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.780]   So many of these conversations
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.000]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.660]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.540]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.660]   I encourage you to check out Longangle,
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.780]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.900]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.420]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.380]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.460]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.300]   (air whooshing)
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.640]   This holiday season, I wanna give gifts to my loved ones
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.600]   that make them feel special and unique,
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.920]   just like the relationships we share.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.200]   If you feel the same way,
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.920]   you should be giving them StoryWorth,
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.380]   which is an incredible gift
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.120]   I've given to the people I care about,
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.440]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.240]   StoryWorth is an online service
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.560]   that helps you and your loved ones
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:54.040]   preserve precious memories and stories for years to come.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.940]   It's a thoughtful and meaningful gift
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.260]   that connects you to those who matter most.
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:01.040]   Each week, StoryWorth emails your relative or friend
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.280]   a thought-provoking question of your choice
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.320]   from a vast pool of options.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.140]   Each unique prompt asks a question
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.440]   you've never thought about,
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.440]   like what's the bravest thing you've ever done,
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.240]   or if you could see into the future,
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.320]   what would you want to find out?
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.480]   After a year, StoryWorth will compile
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.080]   all of your loved one's stories,
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.160]   including photos, into a beautiful keepsake book
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.920]   that you'll be able to share and revisit
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.840]   for generations to come, which, now that we have kids,
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.160]   I couldn't be more excited
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.860]   to start collecting these books to share with them.
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.860]   Reading the weekly stories helps connect you
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:35.220]   with loved ones no matter how near or far apart you are,
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.580]   and you'll be surprised at the things you learn,
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.120]   like how my dad might have gotten into trouble
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.860]   for landing a helicopter at Denny's
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.660]   back when he was in the military.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.720]   With StoryWorth, I'm giving those I love
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.260]   most a thoughtful, personal gift from the heart
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.660]   and preserving their memories and stories for years to come.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:54.820]   Go to allthehacks.com/storyworth
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.180]   to save $10 on your first purchase.
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:01.380]   That's allthehacks.com/storyworth
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.260]   to save $10 on your first purchase.
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.380]   So, we're still in Tokyo.
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.300]   I don't even know how we'd possibly get through all this,
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.980]   but I would love to leave people with some suggestions
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.340]   in the buckets of things to see and do,
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.100]   things to eat, maybe some nightlife.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.020]   Any thoughts on how we even start to make a dent here?
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:23.460]   Yeah, so when you look at the subway map,
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.700]   it's just an, oh my God, I don't know how to deal with this.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.180]   This city must be so massive.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.300]   You can walk through a lot of the city,
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.100]   and don't be allergic to walking.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.620]   What I love to do on my first day back in Japan
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:41.620]   is a triangle from Omotesando to Harajuku,
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:45.220]   and then down to Shibuya, and back again.
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.860]   You can do that triangle, and that's a really fun day.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.060]   You can take it super slow,
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.220]   and what you're getting in that area
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.820]   is a lot of the key touchpoints of the city.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:02.820]   You're getting a lot of the rodeo drive shopping.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:06.220]   Shopping in Japan, especially in Tokyo,
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.260]   is a social activity,
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.060]   because there's such limited public space,
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:14.020]   and people have such small apartments.
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:17.100]   Shopping is a hanging out endeavor,
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.460]   and this is a really major thoroughfare.
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.860]   Omotesando Dori, to do that.
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:27.180]   Off of that are little boutiques, and barber shops,
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.460]   and really cool things,
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.140]   those stores that we wish we all had in our hometowns.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.300]   And then you go all the way to Harajuku,
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:39.300]   the kind of bombastic hip hop meets little boat peep
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:44.540]   that still exists, and right beyond that is the Meiji Shrine,
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.220]   which is absolutely worth a visit.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.100]   And then you turn down and go to Shibuya,
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.460]   and we've all seen on "Lost in Translation"
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.980]   or in other movies, the Shibuya Crossing,
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.700]   the busiest pedestrian crossing in the world.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.300]   And then you can triangle your way back to Omotesando again.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.340]   I love going to one specific restaurant.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.580]   It is hugely popular with everyone.
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.300]   It is very well known.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.380]   It is worth the hype.
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.780]   It's called Maisen.
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:17.820]   It's tonkotsu, so a breaded pork cutlet.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:22.380]   It's 1,100 yen, which currently is about $7.
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:25.180]   For a full meal, you're gonna have to wait in line.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:29.260]   It's in an old onsen, so in an old bathhouse
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.840]   that's been refurbished.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.140]   You could start with that.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.940]   It's very close to Omotesando Station,
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.340]   and then spend the afternoon walking around
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:39.540]   or do the morning and end with lunch there,
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.740]   bearing in mind that if you wanna go into shops,
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.260]   they tend to open a little later than you would expect.
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:47.660]   So 11 o'clock, you'll have all the stores open.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:48.940]   - Yeah, I asked my wife, I was like,
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:50.180]   "What are some of your favorite tips?"
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.900]   And she's like, "Walk everywhere
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.440]   "so that you burn enough calories
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.340]   "that you can have four meals a day."
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:58.860]   - Absolutely, and I think what's really fun
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.780]   is Tokyo's not an expensive city.
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.980]   Everyone talks about how it's so incredibly expensive.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.780]   It's like New York or Paris.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.360]   It is not expensive at all.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.300]   The food is bizarrely inexpensive.
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.340]   Where you're gonna get dinged is on accommodation.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:19.180]   So if you wanna kind of avoid lines
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.300]   and you're really into the food,
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:26.300]   do a 10.45 first lunch and then a 2.45 second lunch.
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.740]   That way, you'll kind of keep things pretty efficient.
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.380]   I do that all the time.
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.140]   - And I will say there are a lot of places,
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.220]   especially if you're going for ramen or something
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.980]   that's not a make a reservation kind of place,
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.220]   where you just wait in line.
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.740]   That's just the way it works.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.560]   And if you're going with a big group,
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.440]   you're not gonna sit down with six people
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.980]   at a lot of these small restaurants.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.580]   And so you just line up.
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:49.300]   I remember it's like two people went in and ate together
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.220]   and then one person ate.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.300]   It might not be the most social meal
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.220]   when you're going to some of these small restaurants,
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.460]   but it will probably be one of the most delicious meals.
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.060]   - And one of the other things to keep in mind,
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.860]   especially in Tokyo,
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.980]   is don't be allergic to a chain restaurant.
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.940]   If you Google a restaurant that had been recommended to you,
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.860]   like a ramen place or a gyoza place,
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.780]   and oh my God, they have six locations.
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.660]   I feel like I don't wanna really do that.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.300]   Don't be dissuaded by a chain.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.940]   The chain is usually because
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.440]   hospitality spaces are so small.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.720]   They can only serve eight people at a time
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.360]   and having a second location
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.440]   just enables them to serve more people.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.840]   Also, the city is so big
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.640]   that if people are traveling an hour
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.920]   to go to their favorite ramen,
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.480]   while suddenly they have a location for it closer to them,
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.480]   it's usually a sign that something's very good
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.760]   rather than it being very corporate.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.600]   - Okay.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.440]   And while we're on food,
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.520]   what are a few things, dining etiquette,
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.180]   tipping, anything there
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.260]   that you wanna give people some overview?
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.100]   - Yeah.
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.140]   You absolutely don't wanna be late to your reservation.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.780]   As we kind of unpacked before,
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.820]   I would really scout Tabalog
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.660]   if you want some good food recommendations
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.600]   from Japanese people.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.020]   There is absolutely no tipping.
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.780]   This isn't even a question of
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.460]   if someone's doing something nice
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.860]   and they're particularly good to leave them a few yen.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.700]   No.
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:12.200]   It is a non-tipping culture
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.320]   to the point where oftentimes,
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.080]   at least in the past,
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.200]   it could be perceived as rude
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.440]   because you're sort of insinuating
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.200]   that this person needs more money.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.900]   I think we may conceive of server jobs
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.080]   as being interstitial.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.480]   Like, "Well, I wanna be a singer,
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.120]   "but I'm a server right now."
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.040]   People bring a certain devotion to their jobs in Japan,
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.160]   whatever they are.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:39.160]   And so people are lifelong servers or restaurateurs.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.760]   So you absolutely don't want to tip.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.360]   - And what about meal times?
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.240]   Like, I know that in French culture, it's normal.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.480]   Sit down for lunch, sit there for a few hours,
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.680]   relax, watch the people go by.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.860]   I feel like in Japan, and you're the expert,
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.500]   but you said it's not expensive.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.340]   Just to be clear,
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.120]   there are also very expensive restaurants.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.360]   Like, you can go to Japan
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.280]   and have a very delicious meal every day
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.040]   for every meal for a month and not spend that much.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.660]   You could also go to Japan
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.880]   and spend a ridiculous amount of money,
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.240]   but I've had the fortunate pleasure
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.720]   of going to like a Michelin starred sushi place
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.520]   and had dinner in less than an hour.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.760]   I would say Japan's not a place to linger
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.960]   after you've eaten a meal in my experience,
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.920]   but I assume you would second that or?
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.520]   - Yeah, and I would say also,
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.280]   it's again, not to harp on this idea of this social contract,
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.800]   but if you're eating at an inexpensive restaurant,
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.440]   if you're going for ramen,
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.040]   or if you're going for gyoza or one of those beef bowls,
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:41.160]   it's sort of like when you're done, you go.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.880]   If you have an empty bowl in front of you,
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.760]   you're sort of no longer welcome.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.000]   Some places will actually give you a time.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.520]   I have definitely been to restaurants where they say,
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.560]   you have one hour starting now to eat,
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.200]   and it's not meant to be rude.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.440]   It is part of that,
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.560]   well, we want to provide you the best service,
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.660]   and the person before you took only their hour.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.800]   So now you are also only going to take your hour.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.200]   There are venues that are where you go and socialize,
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.880]   izakaya, so bars that have bar food.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.640]   It's a lot less structured.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.960]   You go, a lot of times you don't need to make a reservation.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:18.920]   They have an empty table.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.480]   You sit down, you drink, you eat a little, you drink,
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.920]   you eat a little, but everything is very segmented.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.320]   And I would think of dining in Tokyo
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.480]   and in Japan in that manner.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.480]   Think in the United States,
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.840]   we have a lot of restaurants that are pan Japanese.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.040]   You can order sushi, you can order udon,
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.120]   you can order all these,
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.240]   maybe even Thai food at the same restaurant.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.040]   This is the opposite.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.340]   Every restaurant in Japan usually has one thing
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.280]   that they do exceptionally well,
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.360]   and they do it maybe 10 ways.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.000]   So you're going to a soba restaurant,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.960]   you're going to a udon restaurant, a tofu restaurant.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:59.960]   And so everything is much more specialized and specific.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.440]   - Yep, I found that.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.280]   If we went through,
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.680]   we could probably go through a long list,
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.880]   but are there some like maybe off the beaten path
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.520]   types of food specialties or culinary experiences
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.080]   where it's like, go seek out a place
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.240]   that has great X, Y, or Z?
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.240]   - Yeah, I think a lot of people, like you mentioned,
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.960]   are prone to doing a really expensive sushi experience.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.600]   Usually that will be omakase.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.840]   And I think a lot of us have heard the word omakase.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.400]   Really what that means is whatever you want.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.240]   It's actually what you say to the chef at your pleasure.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:36.240]   And what I would recommend doing before indulging in that
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.880]   is going to a kaiten sushi,
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:43.000]   going to a really inexpensive rotating sushi restaurant
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.920]   where they'll have like a little conveyor belt
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.080]   and different things are going to come in front of you
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.120]   and it's going to be very inexpensive.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:53.160]   And take the opportunity to try a few things
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.800]   before you go to the higher end restaurant
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.320]   because as things go higher end,
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.760]   it verges into delicacy territory
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:05.720]   where you are going to get a lot of fish sperm
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:10.560]   or raw octopus, things that have textures
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.480]   that aren't familiar to the Western palate.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.520]   So I would exercise your palate before you go
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.400]   because you don't want to not eat something
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.520]   in front of the chef that is cooking right in front of you
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.920]   at his pleasure, quote unquote.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.320]   - That's a great recommendation.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.760]   Okay, so maybe in the interest of time,
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.800]   are there a few favorite restaurants
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.920]   that you'd recommend people put on a list?
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.240]   I'm sure there's plenty.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.640]   - Oh gosh, yeah.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.400]   So ramen's a big question I get a lot of people wondering.
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.480]   I want to do a ramen meal while I'm there.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.440]   Well, ramen is everywhere now
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.000]   and we have really good ramen in the United States.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.120]   So rather than going to the Ippudo Mothership,
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.480]   even though we have Ippudo here or the Afuri Mothership,
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.600]   I would recommend trying something a little more offbeat.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.200]   So I love kagari ramen.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.560]   It's in Ginza, they have two locations.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.440]   It is a chicken ramen.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.680]   It's a very creamy chicken broth.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.720]   Describing it does not do it.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:08.880]   - It's so good.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.440]   I've been there, it's so good.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.300]   - It's unreal how good it is.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.120]   And why I like that is because
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.280]   you cannot get that anywhere else.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.500]   It is a ramen experience in a ramen place,
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:23.800]   but it is something truly elevated
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.880]   that you will have a hard time finding when you return home.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.800]   Yeah, the other place I'll throw out is Kikanbo,
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.860]   which is known for spice.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.280]   It's a spicy ramen place.
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.920]   You actually pick your ramen on two tiers of spice,
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.360]   both like chili hot spice
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.320]   and the kind of sansho pepper spice,
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.500]   which is kind of like a Sichuan peppercorn
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.400]   with that like numbing spice.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.660]   It's my favorite restaurant in all of Japan.
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:51.960]   And I'm sure if you don't like spicy food,
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.280]   it would not be your favorite.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.080]   And this is maybe overhyped,
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.260]   but Sukumen, like dipping ramen,
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.800]   which it's popping up at a few places in the States,
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   but it's kind of a different style of eating ramen.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:07.080]   And Rokurinisha in Tokyo Station always has a line,
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.760]   but is I think fantastic for trying that out,
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.920]   especially if you find yourself at Tokyo Station
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.440]   with some hours to kill.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.160]   - In the idea where I said that
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.320]   picking a chain is counterintuitive,
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.980]   eating at a train station seems counterintuitive as well,
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.620]   but you have to remember that
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:24.960]   there's a massive commuter culture in Tokyo
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.800]   and a lot of these small businesses under Tokyo Station
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:33.640]   or in and around it are catering to commuter crowds
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.440]   or businessmen at lunch.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.400]   So some of the best quick eats,
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.040]   you could build it into your itinerary.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:41.880]   If you're like, you know,
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.920]   I'm gonna catch the bullet train to Kyoto at one o'clock,
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.160]   go to Tokyo Station at 1130,
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.640]   go get gyoza at Minmin in the basement,
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.080]   or try one of the ramen places.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.000]   They even have incredible French pastries.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.560]   Pick one of those and then get on your train.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:58.440]   - Great tip.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.240]   The same I think is true about department stores.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.720]   I feel like the food court in a big department store
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.240]   or shopping center, in the US,
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:08.000]   it's like filled with the Panda Express and the McDonald's.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.240]   I've had some amazing meals at department store food courts.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.440]   - Department stores is one of those things that,
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.000]   like a toilet that was brought from the West
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.880]   and then vastly improved
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.520]   when it touched down on Japanese soil.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.480]   And so you're gonna see in the basement
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.880]   of a lot of the department stores,
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.680]   they have these huge, huge food courts.
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.320]   It's not what you think of like a mall food court.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.200]   It is all of these artisanal stalls,
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.040]   peppered throughout with incredible fare.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:39.320]   And a lot of that food that you're gonna find down there
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.280]   is both for an elevated lunchtime snack,
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:46.200]   but it also speaks to a culture of omiyage.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.200]   And omiyage is gift giving,
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.640]   something that you're gonna buy for your family
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.680]   when you get home, if you're on a holiday,
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:57.640]   or if you're going to meet someone at their house for dinner,
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.800]   we all bring a bottle of wine or something like that,
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:04.800]   but it is in the way that tipping is necessary in America,
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.520]   omiyage is necessary in Japan.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.480]   So you're gonna go down there
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:12.160]   and find these beautifully wrapped cookies.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.880]   It's omiyage to go.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:17.760]   And if you are gonna engage with local individuals,
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.680]   let's say you're gonna take one of these free tours
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.960]   we've been talking about, bring them omiyage,
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.480]   bring people you meet omiyage,
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.040]   buy key chains from your hometown
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.840]   or maple syrup if you're a Canadian
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.000]   or something that you can travel with,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.800]   or go to a department store and buy these omiyage
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.080]   and you'll go much further than other tourists
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.120]   as far as accessing local culture.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:41.960]   - I love that.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.920]   Any other food tips before we move on?
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.960]   - This is like the optimizers dilemma
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.080]   is I love Japanese food and it's such a broad category
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.720]   that all I wanna do is eat Japanese food while I'm there.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.760]   But man oh man, the best pizza in the world is in Tokyo
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.400]   and I know that sounds blasphemous,
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:04.400]   but Savoy in Azabejuban is my favorite pizza place
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:08.560]   on the planet, it's Neapolitan pies.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.280]   It is incredible.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.840]   I highly recommend it.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:15.640]   And I would think about trying other types of food
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:19.480]   while you're there after you've had your Japanese fix
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.880]   because they just do it so dang well.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.880]   And one of my favorite restaurants,
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.160]   totally under the radar,
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:30.080]   please like let's all keep this between ourselves is Tama.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.840]   It's Okinawan food.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.520]   You're still getting aspects of Japanese culture,
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:37.880]   but you're seeing how it blends with Taiwanese influence.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:41.760]   If you look at a map, Okinawa is much, much closer
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.280]   to Taiwan than it is Japan.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.200]   So you're gonna see how both cultures inform the cuisine.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.520]   Tama is very close to Shibuya, very small restaurant,
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.080]   super friendly staff, big smiles.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.360]   Just tell them, Omakase, just tell them,
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.240]   just bring me some stuff.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.600]   - The two other ones I'll leave.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.040]   There's a punk rock Itsukaya,
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.160]   I'm gonna butcher this name, Tatamichiya.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.240]   I'll put it in the show notes.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.960]   It's just such a cool spot.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.440]   It's good food, good vibes for me,
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.800]   just playing cool music.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.560]   My wife and I almost go every time.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.400]   And the other is gonna be a crazy one,
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.320]   but you'll probably hear lots of people tell you,
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.520]   go to 7-Eleven and just try all these different crazy snacks.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:25.440]   They have in these little plastic bags, pancakes.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.760]   They have all kinds of flavors,
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:27.760]   filled with red bean, filled with this,
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.640]   but they actually have a pancake that's very Americanized,
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:32.200]   which is like filled with maple syrup
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:33.200]   and a little bit of butter.
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.200]   And you can put it in the microwave at 7-Eleven
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.520]   and heat it up.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:39.080]   And I don't know how,
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.080]   but these plastic bag pancakes
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.960]   might be the most delicious pancakes on the planet
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:44.800]   at a 7-Eleven.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.480]   So one, just go to 7-Eleven.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.560]   There's so many crazy things.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.840]   I've heard the egg salad sandwiches are delicious,
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.880]   but not my thing.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.320]   - I could write a love poetry
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:56.760]   to those egg salad sandwich or tamago sando.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.960]   I was gonna say the convenience store,
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.240]   the konbini culture is really fascinating.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.320]   And to save time,
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.880]   we'll link to an article that I wrote
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.640]   about the 10 things you need to buy at a convenience store.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.600]   I fully recommend digging in.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.440]   - Awesome.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.280]   That's so great.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:14.040]   So everyone can go look at one of the many guidebooks
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:16.200]   you've probably written and see,
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.560]   oh, go to the Imperial Palace,
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.720]   go to the Meiji Shrine, that kind of stuff.
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.160]   What are some of your favorites
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.520]   that maybe aren't on the top 10 list?
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.280]   - Well, there are a lot of opportunities
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:30.280]   to climb a tower and see the cityscape from high above.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.800]   Absolutely worth doing.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.480]   Do not pay to do this.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.160]   If there's an opportunity where you need to pay
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.160]   to get in an elevator, don't pay.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:40.600]   The Tokyo Metropolitan offices in Shinjuku,
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.240]   you can go to the top for free.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.000]   It is rammed with tourists.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.640]   My recommendation would be to go to a high-end hotel.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:51.040]   All of their lobbies are lofted over office buildings,
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.720]   and you can get a cocktail in a much more relaxed atmosphere
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.160]   and have that city view.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.160]   The new Four Seasons in Otemachi, I think,
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:01.720]   has the best view of the Imperial Gardens.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.840]   And right behind it on a very clear day,
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.160]   usually in winter, you can see Mount Fuji.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:10.360]   There is no better view amongst the luxury hotels right now.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.640]   Now, as far as more off-the-beaten-path things,
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:17.600]   you're gonna exit the Yamanote line.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.960]   You're gonna take one of the spokes off of the wheel
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.640]   that are on the suburban rail lines,
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.160]   and you're gonna wanna go to neighborhoods
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.720]   like Shimokitazawa.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:32.720]   You're gonna wanna go to Kichijoji or Daikanyama.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.440]   Another popular one is Nakameguro.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:40.320]   And I even like Jyugaoka, which is even further.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.360]   These are more neighborhood-y,
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:46.760]   so a mix of small, traditional houses,
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.360]   and then some newer builds,
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.560]   everything really crammed together.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:55.120]   Little stores, boutiques, mom-and-pop shops
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.160]   next to more corporate things.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:00.360]   I know that I just rambled off five different neighborhoods.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.800]   Write 'em down, give 'em a Google.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.680]   You're gonna find everything that you want in those.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.440]   There's a really good donut shop
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:13.440]   just beyond Shimokitazawa called Haritsu
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.960]   that is in what seems like a little tea house,
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:18.160]   but they serve very modern donuts.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.880]   Give that a whirl.
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.040]   Promise you won't be disappointed.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.240]   - I'll throw one out.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.200]   They're always changing,
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.480]   but there's a company called TeamLab
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:30.320]   that does these really interesting, immersive experiences.
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.840]   The ones we did, Borderless,
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.520]   and one other one I can't remember, maybe Planets.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:36.080]   I don't know which ones are running now.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.240]   It seems that there's always one in Tokyo.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.440]   Highly recommended, kind of wild, interesting,
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.600]   immersive art with lights and maybe sounds,
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:45.680]   maybe textures.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.520]   They're always changing,
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.040]   but those were so awesome that we went to one,
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:49.880]   and the next day we were like,
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.600]   "We have to go to the other."
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.480]   - I'm a huge fan.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.400]   I went to one right before the pandemic
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.240]   and did it twice in that day.
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.080]   I was like, "I need to have
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.960]   "the whole adventure all over again."
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:05.640]   It's very sensory, a lot of textures playing with light.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.800]   There's water.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.000]   You do want to dress appropriately
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   for the one that you have to walk through water
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.440]   and with pants that you can easily pull up.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.040]   Highly recommend that as well.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.040]   That's out in Odaiba.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:18.000]   Odaiba was created in Tokyo Bay
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.640]   using garbage to build man-made islands.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:22.880]   Even though it's an indoor thing,
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:25.160]   you actually should plan that on a very nice day
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.240]   because once you're out there,
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.640]   it's really nice to walk around
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.040]   and take in the city from out there.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:33.280]   It's sort of this pleasure island,
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.440]   sort of Vegas-esque destination
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.280]   with a lot of really cool outdoor stuff.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.640]   - And while we're that direction,
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:39.720]   do you have a strong opinion
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:42.280]   on whether people should be going this,
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.840]   I'm gonna butcher it again, the fish market?
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:45.840]   Let's just leave it at--
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.000]   - Tsukiji. - Tsukiji.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.040]   - Well, so it's no longer in Tsukiji.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.560]   - If I remember right, it's still that direction, right?
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:52.400]   - Yes, it is. - Okay.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.880]   - So it's further out.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:57.520]   So Tsukiji was, is the biggest fish market
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:59.520]   in the world, and then it moved
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.400]   to a bigger location in Toyosu,
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:05.440]   and in the remains of Tsukiji
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:10.160]   are still a lot of little fresh fish,
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:13.920]   sashimi, sushi restaurants and bars.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:17.360]   As far as wanting to do the fish auction
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.280]   and different things like that,
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.320]   that's something that you need
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:22.560]   to talk to a private guide about.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.280]   They all have different kinds of access,
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.040]   and they all have different opinions on it,
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.920]   how you wanna leverage your jet lag
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:31.200]   to get up in the middle of the night to go see it.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.920]   But I think Tsukiji is really close to Ginza.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:37.520]   It's walkable to Ginza if you wanna go check it out
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:41.480]   and try that intro sushi that we were talking about before.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.000]   There's a chain of sushi called Sushi Zanmai,
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.560]   and they're really famous in Japan
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.540]   because the owner is this Colonel Sanders character,
[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:52.360]   come to life, who always famously makes
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:55.040]   the biggest bid at the fish auction.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.840]   He always buys the most expensive fish of the year.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:01.280]   And there's a lot of locations all over Tokyo,
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.700]   and that's a really good place to do your sort of intro
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:07.760]   to more adventurous sushi and sashimi.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.320]   - A couple others for me,
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:12.680]   the Design Sites 2121 Museum I thought was really cool.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:16.240]   Obviously it's a museum, so exhibits change.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.780]   And I'm dying to get your take
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:20.600]   on recommending robot restaurant.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.040]   - Well, there's a lot of different themed restaurants
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.880]   all over Japan and Tokyo.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:28.640]   Once as a kind of wink, I went to the Ninja restaurant
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.480]   for my birthday one year.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.000]   It was super fun and cheesy.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.280]   And of course, you know what you're signing up for.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:39.280]   I shy away from the quote unquote Japan is weird trip.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:45.440]   I don't think that you're getting a lot of true insight.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.880]   I think it would be sort of akin to going
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:53.800]   to like a baseball themed restaurant in America
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:57.840]   or something that is taking a piece of Americana
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.240]   and hyperbolizing it.
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:02.520]   And it's all just for show and for giggles.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:06.120]   Like that's not really my vibe.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:09.760]   You could design an entire itinerary of Japan is weird.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.780]   In the Akihabara neighborhood,
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:14.440]   there are these things called maid cafes
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:17.140]   where all the cafes have a different theme and you go
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:20.120]   and your server takes on a role.
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:22.680]   So there's one where you get to play the older brother
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.760]   and she plays the younger sister.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.560]   There's one where you get to be the prince
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.240]   and she's the princess.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:31.080]   That is sort of culturally curious,
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.720]   might be a little bit hard to access
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.240]   if you don't have Japanese.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:38.080]   But I don't love doing something
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:41.360]   for the sake of zoofying culture.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:44.880]   - Almost every memorable experience I have skews
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:48.260]   on the authentic side of eating at a small place
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:51.400]   with amazing food or going to see something interesting.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.280]   So I don't disagree.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.480]   - That's my soapbox moment for the episode.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:56.400]   (laughing)
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:59.680]   - Maybe one more is if your stay in Tokyo
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:03.720]   aligns with one of the sumo times of year
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:05.960]   that sumo wrestling happens in Tokyo.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:07.440]   I think that's an interesting experience,
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.160]   but it's a very specific time.
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:12.200]   It's not like baseball where there's a game like every week.
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:13.280]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.640]   That is sort of in the Eastern part of the city,
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.760]   sort of beyond like the two o'clock, three o'clock,
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:20.880]   if we're talking about the clock map.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:22.520]   Ryogoku, that area.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:24.240]   Again, this is something that you want to enable
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.960]   with a private guide.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:28.680]   I don't think you want to do the zoo aspect.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.920]   I think that there are ways to engage
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:33.640]   in a more culturally curious manner.
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.960]   I would honestly avoid the Skytree,
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.920]   which is also sort of out in that part of town.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:44.120]   It was built to economically stimulate that area of town,
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.440]   which is a bit older and not as modernized.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.200]   It's just a big tower in the sky
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.720]   with a bunch of shops around it.
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:55.240]   It's pretty far from where you're gonna be staying likely,
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:57.040]   because I would recommend trying to stay
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:01.680]   a little bit closer to the sort of six to nine o'clock
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:02.760]   part of the clock.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.320]   It's just not worth the schlep.
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:07.120]   - Let's do some quick hits on drinks,
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:09.040]   whether it's nightlife or coffee.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.880]   I'll do mine first to try to keep the speed going.
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.000]   There's a really cool coffee shop called Deus Ex Machina,
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.080]   which is like, can't remember the neighborhoods,
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:17.920]   but you can Google it.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.920]   I'll put it in the show notes,
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:22.800]   which is one of our favorite coffee shops in Tokyo.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:26.000]   And then for drinks and stuff, my favorite bars,
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.040]   I'm just gonna list them,
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:30.800]   are Bar Trench, Bar Tram, and Bar Benfidich.
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.640]   - Benfidich. - Yeah.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.160]   Again, the coffee, tea, nightlife areas.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.880]   - We'd go to Naka Meguro,
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.920]   which is like a very cool neighborhood.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:42.560]   That's where they have a massive multi-story
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:45.480]   Starbucks reserve that you walk by.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.080]   (laughing)
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.640]   And kind of ogle at the fact
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:52.640]   that there's a 90 minute wait to get in.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.880]   And then you go up the street
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.920]   to a place called Breakfast Club,
[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:01.240]   which is this Japanese version of an American diner
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:06.240]   run by these two cool kind of DJ guys
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:11.240]   who just have this really cool breakfast
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:15.240]   all day, every day vibe with diner coffee.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.920]   And it's just so much fun.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.240]   I love going there.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:24.240]   Great music, kind of breakfast meets bar.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.240]   As far as coffee goes,
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.280]   I made the mistake of putting it in The Lonely Planet
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.200]   about 12 years ago when I was working on the Japan Guide.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.240]   But in Shinkitazawa, you want to go to Bear Pond.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.880]   A little hole in the wall, massively popular.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.360]   Do not try to take a photo.
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.680]   They will be mad at you.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.040]   But excellent espresso.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.200]   Any thoughts on nightlife?
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.360]   I feel like I'm past my nightlife prime
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.080]   other than getting some good cocktails.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.080]   But anything you want to add to that category?
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.720]   Back in the day when I was a student,
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.880]   the Metro stops at around one
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.280]   and then starts back up at five.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.680]   At 12.50, you're like, okay guys, are we going home
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.360]   or are we going out all night
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.840]   and getting on the five o'clock train?
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.440]   And usually it meant going out all night
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.800]   and getting on the five o'clock train.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.160]   Back then, like 20 years ago,
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.280]   it was Shibuya and Roppongi
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.360]   where the big club place is.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.400]   And that's kind of changed and evolved.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.840]   Shibuya has had, there's sort of like a love hotel
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.960]   kind of seedy side to the back of Shibuya
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.160]   that is evolving right now
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.480]   and it's becoming a much more commercial
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.560]   and wholesome destination.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.360]   There are a lot of new high-end hotels that are going in.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.520]   If you want to give something an interesting try,
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:40.520]   I would try like a multi-course cocktail.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.560]   If you're really into cocktails,
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:47.880]   I'm very happy with highball or like a whiskey on the rocks.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:50.000]   If you're a cocktail person,
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.920]   there are a handful of different cocktail restaurants
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.640]   where you're doing like four cocktails over a couple hours
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.840]   and each one is very different
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.120]   and they're paced as though you're having a meal.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.640]   Just like we talked about pizza and coffee and everything,
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.760]   taking cocktails to the next level,
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.560]   there are some of the best cocktail bars
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.560]   and cocktails in the world in Japan.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.640]   I feel like you could pick anything and just say that
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.760]   and it would probably be true,
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.240]   but I have a lot of personal experience
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.920]   on the cocktail front to say that it is true.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.640]   There is this through theme also of intentionality.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.000]   Every business owner brings this incredible intentionality
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:25.920]   to their products.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:29.960]   Like Ben Fittich is incredible in that way
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.960]   where the bartender is making everything involved.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.320]   I've been to restaurants
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.600]   where the chef is even making the silverware
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.520]   that you're using.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.560]   So this incredible intentionality
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.920]   just permeates food and beverage.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.360]   And if you are a cocktail nerd, a mixology nerd,
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.400]   you're really not gonna find
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.400]   any other better cocktails on the planet.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.280]   - Yeah, I completely agree.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.480]   I have two questions.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:56.560]   One, I don't know the answer to.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.880]   I didn't have kids when I went,
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.560]   so you've written guidebooks,
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.400]   so I'm sure you've had to think about this.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.400]   What's the vibe like with bringing kids,
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.920]   bringing them to restaurants, that kind of stuff?
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.040]   - That's a really good question,
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.440]   especially because it's a country
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.000]   that we always see in the news
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.360]   that is shrinking in population.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.240]   So there are not a lot of kids out and about.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.280]   And also, how do you bring a kid who's very young
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.080]   and how do you control their behavior
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.800]   to abide by the social contract
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.760]   of being a good guest in different places?
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.360]   Well, I mean, not everyone is expecting
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.080]   your three-year-old child to be perfect.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:35.080]   Do you take that person to a $300 Omakase?
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.960]   No, because you're not bringing that person
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.960]   to that $300 Omakase at home either.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.880]   I have seen, because of the pandemic,
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.600]   maybe a lot more green spaces opening up.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.560]   There's a beautiful walk that you can do
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:49.600]   in Shimokitazawa now that they buried the track
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.160]   between three stations,
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:56.160]   and now that has been turned into really cool walking paths
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.000]   and gardens and shops.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.120]   I would try to keep kids sort of more in those areas.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.200]   And there's a lot of dining in that manner
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.480]   where you can eat out on a patio,
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:12.320]   and then it's a little bit less intense to have your kids.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.600]   I will say from all of my experiences in Japan,
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.400]   it's like lots of walking, moving around,
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.760]   eating four meals a day.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.200]   It would have been hard to do the kind of experiences
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.240]   I've done with kids.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:25.000]   I'm sure there's a different itinerary
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.760]   for a family-friendly trip,
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.880]   but I think for us, we're just like,
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.280]   maybe we're just gonna wait a few years
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.680]   till the kids are a little older.
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.560]   Not saying it's impossible.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:36.640]   I know the kind of Japan trip we love having,
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.680]   and I feel like we might not get it
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:41.600]   if we go with infants and toddlers.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.040]   - I agree, and I don't wanna discourage families
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.680]   from booking a family trip to Japan,
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.080]   but I would say that the trip that you think
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.880]   you want to have will be difficult to execute
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.040]   with a toddler.
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.800]   - Yeah, especially if that is cocktails
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.320]   and lots of street food.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:59.480]   Is there any last thing in Tokyo that we didn't mention
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.800]   or you're like, I gotta share this?
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.040]   Even if it's such a secret
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.640]   that we keep it out of the show notes.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:09.000]   - Well, I do have one ultra favorite restaurant.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.360]   I've probably celebrated about 10 birthdays in Japan,
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:16.000]   maybe 15, and many of them have happened at that restaurant,
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.760]   but you're gonna have to DM me on Instagram
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.600]   for the name of it.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.080]   Sorry. - Ooh, I like it.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:20.920]   I like it.
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.640]   - It's a yakitori restaurant,
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.480]   so it's chicken and vegetables rather on skewers.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.040]   Small place, great vibe, incredible drinks.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.480]   - I was gonna call this your best guest secret,
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.600]   and you're literally gonna keep it
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.000]   a little bit of a secret for the episode,
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.600]   but we'll link to your Instagram in the show notes.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.680]   It's just brandpress.
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:37.520]   I appreciate that.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.040]   I'm gonna send you a DM right after this.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.880]   Okay, we gotta move on to Kyoto.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.840]   There is an infinite amount of things
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.960]   that we could keep talking about in Tokyo.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:49.480]   Our next partner has a product I literally use every day.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.960]   I started taking AG1 from Athletic Greens
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.480]   because I wanted an easy way
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:55.400]   to get my daily nutritional insurance
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.360]   and optimize my immune system,
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.880]   and it's been in my routine for almost a year,
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.200]   because when you take one scoop of AG1,
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.720]   you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.040]   minerals, whole food source superfoods,
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:10.360]   probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.840]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:16.000]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.080]   and head to my office feeling focused
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.600]   and energized for the day,
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.120]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.880]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.560]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.320]   To make giving it a try easy,
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.400]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.280]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.760]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.600]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.240]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.920]   to take ownership over your health
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.880]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:58.040]   - 'Twas the season of Audi, and all along the roads,
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.840]   drivers were driving all the way home.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.760]   After long journeys, all arrived on the scene,
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.720]   greeting friends and family and in need of caffeine.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:10.560]   Laugh off the worries and frigid cold air.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.800]   The best part of the holidays is simply being there.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:18.160]   How we get there matters, but being there matters more.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:21.600]   Celebrate the season of Audi.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:25.720]   - I just wanna thank you, Quick,
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:28.040]   for listening to and supporting the show.
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.880]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.320]   and discounts from our partners,
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.880]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.

[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.480]   To go back to what you said earlier,
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.240]   I feel like every time we go to Japan,
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.200]   there are some countries
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.720]   where you'd come for your next trip
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.400]   and you'd skip the main city
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.280]   'cause you've been there before.
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.040]   Every time we're like, "Let's go back to Tokyo,
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.880]   "there's so much more to uncover."
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.920]   But we've gotta move on.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.120]   You said there's two places
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.480]   that everyone should consider going,
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.040]   it's Tokyo and Kyoto.
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:03.360]   How do you think about Kyoto being organized
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.160]   to the extent that's helpful?
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.600]   - Okay, so the first mistake that people make
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.680]   when they're doing a trip to Japan
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:10.760]   and they do Tokyo and Kyoto
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:14.560]   is they think Tokyo, new, Kyoto, old.
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.400]   Big mistake.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.880]   You're missing so many cool things in Tokyo
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.440]   by only focusing on the new,
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:22.940]   and you're missing so much of the essence of Kyoto
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:24.520]   by only focusing on the old,
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.640]   and that's places of worship and castles
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:28.480]   and stuff like that.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.960]   The other mistake that people make with Kyoto
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:34.520]   is that because they have old in their brain,
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.440]   they wanna stay at a traditional inn.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:40.280]   And part of staying at a ryokan
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.440]   is that you're gonna be served dinner
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.360]   and you're gonna be served breakfast,
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:48.040]   and it's all about fostering relaxation.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.640]   It really seems antithetical
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.360]   to the time that you're gonna spend in the city,
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:55.860]   which is gonna be just as excited about getting around
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:57.160]   and seeing all the temples
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:00.260]   and seeing all the cafes and experiencing the culture.
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:03.240]   So I would leave that traditional inn,
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:07.300]   that ryokan experience for the countryside
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:11.280]   and not marry it to your Kyoto experience.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.080]   Now, happy to indulge in all the oldness that is Kyoto.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.900]   It is the ancient capital.
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:19.580]   It is an incredible city
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:21.660]   with some of the oldest cultural relics
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:23.740]   that remain intact in the world,
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:26.940]   but at its core, it's also a place of learning.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.900]   It's a college town.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:31.980]   It's much smaller than Tokyo,
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:35.180]   and there's a thriving student culture there
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.940]   that is well worth tapping into,
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:39.740]   and that's tea shops, cafes,
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:43.700]   really cool clothing stores and boutiques,
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:47.980]   getting into handicrafts and these old family businesses.
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:51.660]   You should absolutely pick a handful of temples
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:54.460]   that you wanna see and appreciate that culture,
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:56.300]   but a lot of people treat those temples
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:58.220]   the way that people in Europe treat a church.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.980]   They go and they're just like, wow, opulence,
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:02.260]   the cathedral, super cool,
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:06.220]   without delving too much into the history aspect of it all.
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.340]   And it's okay if you're allergic to,
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:11.780]   oh, this temple was made in 1636, or da da da da,
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.260]   that's fine, I'm kind of allergic to that as well,
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:15.500]   but just make sure to bear in mind
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:20.500]   to have a broader experience in Kyoto than you might expect.
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.700]   You're gonna see a lot of people walking around
[01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.260]   in traditional attire.
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:27.980]   A lot of people come back from trips to Japan
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:31.220]   and they say, oh my God, I saw a geisha in Kyoto.
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:32.460]   You did not see a geisha.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:35.620]   You saw a Taiwanese traveler
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:38.700]   who rented her kimono for the day and they dress you up.
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.380]   This is a really popular thing for Korean,
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:44.940]   Singaporean, Taiwanese travelers to do.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.740]   The geisha culture that you hear about
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.900]   from members of a geisha in Gion,
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.460]   one of the geisha districts,
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:53.340]   is much more behind closed doors.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:55.980]   - And is that something that there's a way to learn,
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.060]   appreciate, and experience and understand it?
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:59.900]   Or is it one of the few things
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:02.300]   that is hard for Westerners to be a part of?
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.900]   - This is something that you're gonna have to plan
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:04.740]   while in advance.
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.140]   This is something that a lot of people
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:09.820]   have gained access to over years of building relationships.
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:14.820]   And there are pricey, personalized, luxury experiences
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:17.740]   where you can go spend time with a maiko,
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:20.300]   like a geisha in training, or a geisha,
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:23.500]   and have a really mind-expanding experience
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.060]   about what that culture looks like.
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:26.460]   I mean, it is on the decline.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:29.060]   It's not what it was a long time ago.
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:31.980]   This is something, a bit of former glory.
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:34.300]   But it is still there for you to consume.
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:35.620]   But the best way to do it would be
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:37.980]   to pick a luxury travel planner
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:40.380]   and book that experience through them
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.540]   as a one-on-one experience.
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:44.420]   - And this is something that we didn't mention earlier
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:45.740]   when we talked about restaurants,
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:48.660]   but I find that unlike many places in the world
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.140]   where it's just pop up, open table, make your reservation,
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.420]   search online for, book a tour,
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:56.380]   there are still a ton of restaurants and experiences
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:58.780]   that if you don't have a travel planner
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:02.020]   or a higher-end hotel concierge, you just can't do.
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:03.580]   Is that the experience you've seen?
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:04.980]   Or is there another way to access
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:07.860]   some of these restaurants or experiences?
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:09.300]   - That's pretty much right.
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:11.140]   And as someone who cut their teeth
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:13.020]   writing guidebooks for Lonely Planet,
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:16.980]   I am all about trying to enable as many opportunities
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:20.980]   for travelers and readers on their own that I can.
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:24.260]   But a lot of these things are guarded.
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:26.260]   So you will need a luxury travel planner
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:30.580]   who has made 20 or 30 years of inroads in the destination,
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:34.380]   who forged that relationship with the Geisha house
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:35.980]   to make that happen.
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:38.340]   So if that is something that's a priority to you
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:40.260]   and you wanna have the real experience,
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:42.140]   you are going to pay for it.
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.820]   I'll caution people, one option is,
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:47.460]   if you do wanna have one of those experiences,
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:49.820]   either book through a luxury travel provider
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:51.820]   or at a higher-end hotel,
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:53.420]   you don't have to do it the whole time.
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:54.780]   So I tell people, there are some restaurants
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:56.500]   that are very difficult to get a reservation at
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:00.340]   without a high-end travel organizer or concierge or hotel,
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.860]   but you could book one or two nights at that hotel.
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:04.700]   I was gonna say at the end,
[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:06.060]   we may be talking a bonus episode
[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:07.900]   about how to do that with points
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:10.140]   and then line up some of those things
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.940]   that you need support from.
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:13.580]   And then you could move to another hotel
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:16.020]   that's not as expensive if you don't.
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:16.900]   Keep all that in mind.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:18.340]   There are an unlimited number
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:21.380]   of great restaurants experiences you can have without that.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:23.420]   But for anyone listening who's trying to have
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:24.940]   one of those kind of coveted
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:27.020]   or higher-end exclusive experiences
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:29.500]   or dining at three Michelin star restaurant,
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.380]   it's not as simple as just going online and booking.
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:34.300]   - Yeah, I should say on background too,
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:38.060]   I was in Japan right as everything was shutting down in 2020
[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:39.420]   and the reason that I was there
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:42.460]   is I was doing a very intense audit
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:46.580]   of all of the hotels in Tokyo for Conde Nast Traveler,
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.260]   all the ones that were opening up
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:50.980]   in anticipation of the Olympics.
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:52.980]   Of course, that was completely curtailed
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:55.540]   and my editor was like, "Get home, get home.
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:57.340]   "They're closing the borders."
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:01.060]   So when it reopened, I went back to complete that audit.
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:05.100]   So I stayed at dozens of hotels in Tokyo
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.660]   and my editor, when I got home,
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:07.500]   she was like, "Okay, Brandon,
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:10.060]   "what did you see that was different
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:11.180]   "than before the pandemic?"
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.480]   And I said, "Well, you know what?
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:16.420]   "It's that all of these hotels now wanna be
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:20.380]   "the purveyor of your experience."
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.420]   Because in all of this time,
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:25.420]   hotels, they were really hurt during the pandemic,
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:26.940]   so they're trying to find different ways
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.780]   to bring in more revenue.
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:32.460]   So a lot of hotels were doing really compelling F&B,
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:33.460]   food and beverage,
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.820]   bringing in locals to eat at the restaurants
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:40.660]   in case the tourism dwindles again for some unknown reason.
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:41.980]   The other thing that's happening
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:46.340]   is hotels are offering tours.
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:49.500]   And I'm not talking about the group tour thing
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.820]   where a bunch of you are going around with a flag.
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:56.580]   Hotels like Aman in Tokyo have a secret concierge service
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.700]   where they will take you to local artisans
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:02.940]   to have personalized experience
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:06.540]   where they will cut you kimono and yukata robes,
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:09.860]   or they will hand etch chopsticks for you,
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:11.960]   or you can do fan design.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:16.100]   These are all exclusive opportunities that Aman offers.
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:18.140]   All of the hotels are getting into this.
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.180]   So even if you kind of cringe at the idea
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:23.620]   of having a travel planner, one of those travel services,
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.860]   squeeze out a little bit more from your concierge
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:27.780]   at these high-end hotels
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:31.800]   because they want to give you more than just a room.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.040]   And I would say the Aman is probably at the top of the mark,
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.140]   but we've stayed at the Hilton,
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:39.420]   which is not near Aman prices,
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:43.120]   but at a lot of the very big established hotels
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:46.140]   at that level, there are still incredible concierges.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:48.700]   The Hilton concierge was able to help
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:51.340]   with a number of reservations and activities
[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:54.180]   that would have been much harder for me to do myself.
[01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:56.060]   Obviously, some of the more exclusive things
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:59.040]   might be catered or offered at the higher-end hotels
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.560]   like the Aman, but I had a ton of success
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.540]   at even just the Hilton Tokyo.
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:04.380]   - Totally.
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:06.340]   So back in Kyoto, one of the things like sort of
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:08.300]   I mentioned in Tokyo, my first day,
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:12.060]   I like to do a triangle to connect three little areas.
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:14.580]   For Kyoto, my thing that I always do when I go
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:16.380]   is I rent a bicycle.
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:18.980]   And I usually cheat and rent one of those electric ones
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:20.540]   that helps you along the way.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:22.780]   Kyoto's very hilly.
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:26.480]   It's sort of hemmed between two mountains in a way.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.940]   It's very different than Tokyo
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.120]   in that it's very low-lying.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.200]   A lot of Japanese people say it's very European.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.980]   There's a river that flows through it.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:40.320]   But because traffic is much less
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:41.920]   and everything moves a little slower,
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.020]   it's really easy to get around on a bicycle.
[01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:48.380]   Just remember that you're on the left side of the road.
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:51.140]   And it's a great way to explore
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:55.500]   because it's such a small city relative to Tokyo.
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:17:00.380]   It's really hard to get lost.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:02.820]   You can go up and down different streets.
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:05.300]   You can pop in and out of different neighborhoods.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:09.720]   And you're never gonna be woefully far from your hotel.
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:12.100]   - When my wife and I went over 15 years ago
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:13.740]   to Japan for the first time,
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.220]   the first thing we did was we rented a bike
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:16.220]   from the train station.
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.500]   We just set our bags.
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.460]   I don't remember a lot of how the logistics of that happened
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:21.840]   but I do remember we rented the bike
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:24.420]   right at the train station and went and explored.
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:26.100]   And I think we came back and got our luggage
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.140]   'cause we had a late check-in.
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:27.980]   So I love that.
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:30.100]   I'm sure in the Lonely Planet for Kyoto,
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:32.620]   there's top 21 experiences that you should have.
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:35.380]   Let's skip those and maybe share some of your favorite
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:39.140]   things that people should do or see or eat or anything.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:41.000]   - One of the things I guarantee
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.140]   is not in any of the guidebooks yet
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:48.140]   is the Park Hyatt Kyoto just opened.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:51.300]   And so Park Hyatt Tokyo is the super famous
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.900]   Lost in Translation Hotel in Shinjuku,
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:56.980]   has the New York bar, always rammed with people.
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:18:01.300]   Park Hyatt Kyoto is very close to Kiyomizu-dera
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:04.980]   which is one of the most famous places of worship.
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:08.940]   Absolutely a must, kind of a worth the hype temple
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:11.260]   but it's right in the heart of the action
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:16.260]   and it's accessible to everyone because they have a bar,
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:18.580]   totally different than the one in Tokyo
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:21.620]   but this bar overlooks the city
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:25.740]   and the one very famous pagoda.
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:30.740]   And I couldn't hold a conversation when I was there
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:33.320]   because I was so mesmerized by the view.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:37.440]   It is just one of those, it costs you the price
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:41.640]   of a cocktail, it costs $18, price of a cocktail
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.720]   to have this incredible view.
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:49.180]   And because it's so new, no one's talking about it yet.
[01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:53.060]   So it's a very small bar with a very few amount of seats
[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:57.220]   but if you're going really soon, absolutely go and do this.
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:59.180]   The hotel is extremely expensive
[01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:02.540]   and is only for a certain type of traveler
[01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:05.200]   but this is something that I feel is pretty accessible
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:09.320]   to everyone and absolutely worth doing at sunset.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.080]   In the wintertime, that sunset is oddly early.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:16.220]   So if you're okay having a drink at 4.45 p.m.,
[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:17.700]   absolutely go for it.
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:21.100]   This was like my one revelation of Kyoto
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.420]   on this particular trip a few weeks ago.
[01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:25.460]   - Did my screen share just pop up?
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.300]   - You did.
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.740]   - Just shared a photo of having that cocktail
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:31.860]   at that bar with that pagoda in the background.
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:34.400]   We stayed at the Park Hyatt in Kyoto
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:37.220]   and you say very expensive but I will say,
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:39.400]   Chase transfers to Park Hyatt on points
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.960]   is maybe one of the best deals in the world.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.440]   So it is actually accessible
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.460]   if you can find the availability.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:45.580]   The hotel was amazing.
[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:49.140]   I will say we stayed there like weeks after it opened
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:51.620]   and it was very rough around the edges.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.260]   I have no doubt that the Park Hyatt
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:56.220]   has cleaned up those rough edges
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:58.460]   but we had some frustrating experiences
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.780]   for a hotel of that level.
[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:02.260]   But wow, the bar was amazing.
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:04.800]   We couldn't even get into the restaurant at the hotel
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.220]   which is next to the bar and had an awesome view.
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:08.180]   So I can't speak to it
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:10.120]   because even though we stayed there four nights,
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.420]   they were like, "Oh, sorry, we don't have any tables."
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:14.500]   It was such a strange thing to not be able to eat
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.700]   at the hotel restaurant on a few days notice
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:19.500]   but wholeheartedly recommend the hotel.
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:23.700]   It's so beautiful and very inaccessible with dollars
[01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:25.600]   but accessible with points.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:26.980]   Hyatt's great for that.
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:31.380]   A lot of people level up to the Grand Hyatt in Tokyo
[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:34.060]   which is cheaper than the Park Hyatt brand.
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:35.580]   It's sort of one level down.
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:38.300]   That hotel, decor wise, it's long in the tooth.
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:39.480]   The location is great.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.700]   You're really right in the middle of town
[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:44.140]   and it's a little splurge
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:46.940]   if you're more of a budget traveler
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.260]   and you have those points, go for the Grand.
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:52.820]   - So I'll share a couple things from Kyoto, from our trip
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:56.220]   that are just kind of quick hits that I really enjoyed.
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:59.900]   So bar rocking chair, I went one night
[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:01.900]   with my brother-in-law and we were like,
[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:03.100]   "Do we even have to leave?
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:05.780]   Should we just stay here, keep coming back?"
[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:06.620]   - I love that place.
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:08.060]   - It's such a cool bar.
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:09.300]   It was also very funny
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:11.940]   because my brother-in-law is like six five.
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:14.420]   He barely fit in part of that bar.
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:18.900]   There's a tea shop called Yugen which serves matcha
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:20.980]   and it was just wonderful.
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:22.940]   I say this about so many parts of Japan
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:25.780]   but a very beautifully designed matcha shop
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:27.180]   that I really loved.
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:29.420]   And then I already mentioned the pizza shop
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:31.940]   at the beginning and Coco Raya was just an itsukaya
[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:33.080]   that we went to and had a great time.
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:34.780]   I'm not gonna say it's the best itsukaya in the world
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:38.260]   but if you're looking for one, we had a great time there.
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:41.100]   - I'm gonna add a tea destination as well, Ippodo.
[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:45.100]   So not Ippudo like the ramen but Ippodo.
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.460]   They're really close to the Ritz-Carlton
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:51.100]   and they do tea tasting.
[01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:54.660]   So think of it exactly in like a wine tasting kind of way.
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.620]   You can sign up to do a tea tasting.
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:58.740]   The taste is incredible.
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.740]   The packaging is so beautiful.
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:04.540]   This is a good omiyage for someone that you really like
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:07.580]   back at home or someone that you're meeting in Japan.
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:10.580]   Has a very storied reputation in the country.
[01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:14.100]   One of the places that I wanna recommend is Monk.
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:17.780]   It's a restaurant that my editor at Bloomberg,
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:21.140]   she was in Japan with her husband a few years ago
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:23.700]   and she ate there and I was in Tokyo at the time
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.580]   and she called me and she was like,
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:27.420]   "Get your butt down to Kyoto.
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:28.500]   "You need to go to this restaurant
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.900]   "and you need to write about it."
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:34.060]   Basically what it is, takes the sort of multi-course
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:37.180]   kaiseki idea in Japanese cuisine
[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:40.180]   but it flips it Italian style.
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:43.580]   And instead of having a hearty rice dish,
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:46.220]   which usually punctuates the end of a kaiseki meal,
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:47.140]   it's a pizza.
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:49.780]   And I really like, let's not obsess about pizza in Japan.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:51.580]   People are gonna think we're weird.
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:55.140]   But it's run by Chef Imai
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:23:00.140]   and he brings this monastic discipline to his food
[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:02.980]   and I believe after our story ran,
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:07.540]   it found its way to a Netflix chef's table episode.
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:10.700]   It's well worth checking out
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:13.100]   and also give yourself a little bit of time
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:14.580]   to walk around that part of town.
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.940]   It's a little more residential,
[01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:17.020]   it's a little more out of the way,
[01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:19.220]   you're not gonna see other tourists over there.
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:22.100]   It's beautiful, there's a beautiful path
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:24.940]   that goes through the nature of that neighborhood too.
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:28.100]   So kind of bundle that experience together.
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:31.860]   - Any specific types of food that you're in Kyoto,
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:34.420]   Kyoto's the place to try X or Y?
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:35.460]   - Man, that's a good question.
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:38.580]   I did wanna give one suggestion
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:41.140]   that is along those lines but a little unexpected.
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:45.380]   It's gin, there's a gin tasting room called Kinobi.
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.940]   Kinobi kind of came out the gate,
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:50.620]   I wanna say about five, six years ago now.
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:53.100]   And as someone who writes about a lot
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:54.500]   of different destinations all over the world,
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:57.780]   I am constantly being pitched a local gin, constantly.
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:01.820]   Like people are making gin out of sawdust at this point.
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:05.420]   And I was fascinated by Kinobi,
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:09.500]   they're using a lot of the local botanicals.
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:14.500]   There's like Kyo-Yasai, basically the local Kyoto harvest,
[01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:17.300]   which really informs this gin.
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:20.180]   And I'm admittedly not a big gin person,
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.740]   I'm more of a brown spirits person.
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.880]   This is absolutely my favorite.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.680]   And in the quiet of the pandemic,
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:26.980]   they opened a tasting room.
[01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:29.740]   And it is well worth going to try.
[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:32.820]   And speaking of Kyo-Yasai and this local harvest,
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:35.700]   this is really what the area is all about.
[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:38.660]   And one of the best restaurants
[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:40.940]   that it's not gonna break the budget,
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:45.060]   it's called Yasai Hori, Hori is the name of the chef.
[01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:48.060]   There's a lot of indoor shopping arcades in Kyoto
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:51.140]   and it's off of one of those, really inconspicuous.
[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:55.660]   It has two tables and like eight bar tops.
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:58.700]   The only staff member is chef.
[01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:01.300]   And he's gonna do really honest food.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:05.340]   I think a lot of American food is overly sauced.
[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:06.740]   This is the antidote.
[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:10.700]   This is mushrooms on an open fire.
[01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:14.580]   This is avocado and red onion.
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:17.380]   This is very simple cuisine
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:21.920]   that the ingredients are just screaming flavor at you.
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.840]   - This is not a good thing to be talking about
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:24.940]   right before lunch.
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:27.260]   Like, do I eat here or just go to SFO
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:28.620]   and take a trip to Japan?
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:31.340]   It seems like we bring up a lot of food and drinking,
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.620]   but are there other things to spend the time
[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:36.380]   in between eating or drinking in Kyoto
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:37.680]   other than a few of the shrines
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.260]   that you think are worth highlighting?
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:44.180]   - You're not gonna find that Brooklyn-esque quality
[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:47.300]   that you do in Tokyo with certain neighborhoods
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:49.960]   that are just so effortlessly cool,
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:53.400]   but it's well worth picking a couple neighborhoods
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:56.900]   in Kyoto as well and just doing the back alley walks.
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:59.140]   You're just gonna see a lot of businesses
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:02.640]   that have been around for 300 or 400 years,
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:05.200]   places that sell very specific things
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.620]   like 11 types of scissors.
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:09.340]   There was a shop that I went to
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:11.980]   that sold needles for sewing
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:16.480]   that had little sculptures on the tip, on the eye,
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.860]   like a little frog that you had to look at
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:20.900]   through a magnifying glass.
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:22.540]   Little specific shops like this,
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:23.860]   and that you're only gonna find
[01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:27.300]   by doing a back alley walk in neighborhoods
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:30.420]   like Gion, in Sanjo, different places like that.
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:32.540]   - And culturally, is it okay if you see a little shop,
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:35.100]   even if you're not gonna buy a needle or a pair of scissors,
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:37.780]   to walk in and look around, is that okay?
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:38.620]   - Absolutely.
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:41.060]   You can go into any shop that's open,
[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:42.580]   thank them for their time,
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:45.020]   express interest in what they're doing.
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:47.220]   A lot of people are really proud
[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:48.360]   of the things that they're doing.
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:51.900]   I was in a small town on Lake Biwa on my last trip,
[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:55.580]   about an hour outside of Kyoto, called Hikone,
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:58.860]   and went for udon, and at the end of the meal,
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:00.980]   the man who ran the udon shop, his wife,
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:03.980]   was making origami, and when the bill was paid,
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:05.600]   she handed me an origami crane,
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:07.660]   and she was like, "Here, I made this."
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:10.100]   And she was just so proud of it, and I kept it.
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.580]   It's in my office now.
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:14.860]   You just find great pride in what everyone's doing,
[01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:17.580]   so engage with those people.
[01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:21.000]   Usually the people that are in the shop, it's their stuff.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.620]   - I will say, this translates to
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:24.380]   anytime you're getting anything,
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:27.540]   even if it's the concierge giving you their business card.
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:28.900]   I think in American culture, it's like,
[01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:30.220]   thanks, throw it in your pocket.
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:32.800]   And I find that anytime you're getting anything,
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:35.620]   just holding it and accepting it and appreciating it
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:38.780]   is a sign of respect that goes a long way,
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:42.740]   and is much more the standard of receiving things in Japan.
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:43.860]   - Yeah, if you're expecting someone
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:48.220]   to be an engaged shop owner, be an engaged customer.
[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:50.140]   This is, again, that give and take.
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:51.840]   You're part of the social dynamic.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.860]   Not everything is just coming to you.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:57.360]   - So, we said we were gonna not go as deep
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.840]   on other places as we did on Tokyo and Kyoto,
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.600]   but I do wanna highlight some of them,
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:05.100]   because I think people who have that extra few days
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:06.640]   where they wanna go see something more
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:07.920]   than just Tokyo and Kyoto,
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:10.600]   or people who are coming back and wanna see something else,
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:13.880]   you did a high level of the four islands
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:16.000]   and a little bit of the vibe on each,
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.920]   but what are some emerging destinations
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:21.760]   or interesting places that you'd suggest people go to?
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:24.920]   I really only have one, so I'll go first,
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.580]   which is we found this hotel,
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:29.560]   and it was kind of what you were describing,
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:32.340]   where we were looking for that kind of traditional,
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:34.640]   the eat breakfast and dinner in the hotel,
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:37.400]   not really go anywhere, relax experience.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.600]   And so we just took a trip to a region called Niigata,
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.960]   and we stayed at this amazing design hotel
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.720]   called Satoyamo Jujo,
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.880]   which I would say it's not quite a ryokan,
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:49.640]   but in that we weren't sleeping on tatami mats,
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:52.520]   and it wasn't that traditional, but it was amazing.
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.680]   And that town was known for soba,
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:57.700]   so we walked around town and walked by a school,
[01:28:57.700 --> 01:29:00.240]   and it was definitely not a popular destination
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:01.600]   in the season we went,
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:04.280]   but that was just an awesome hotel
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:06.560]   and relaxing experience for a couple days.
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:07.720]   And that's all I have,
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.560]   so I'm gonna turn the entirety
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:12.800]   of non-Tokyo, Kyoto, Japan over to you.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.520]   So I'll circle back on that idea
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.920]   of what are the ingredients for a perfect first
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.640]   or fourth trip to Japan,
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:22.040]   which is old and new, mountains and sea.
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:24.800]   And I think all of them are really easy to hit.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:28.140]   You can hit them all very close to Tokyo,
[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:31.040]   even if you only have a shorter trip.
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:34.200]   I spent quite a bit of time in Kyushu,
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:37.620]   in the southernmost main island this time around,
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:42.620]   because I am a major fan of onsen culture,
[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:43.720]   hot spring culture,
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:47.000]   and because the islands are so active volcanically,
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.400]   there is just hot water gurgling up everywhere,
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:53.160]   to the point where there are hotels in Tokyo
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:56.880]   that pipe in hot water from miles and miles and miles away
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:00.800]   to have that mineral water bath within the property.
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:05.800]   Kyushu is sort of the motherland of onsen culture,
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:09.000]   more so than places like Hakone,
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.480]   which you might have heard of a lot,
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:12.440]   because it's very close to Tokyo,
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.920]   so a lot of people go there.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:17.040]   Kyushu has an Oita prefecture,
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.800]   and I should say as an aside,
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:21.080]   prefectures are like states,
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:23.240]   and they all have different reputations,
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:27.640]   and they all have different local foods and vibes,
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:30.040]   and they all kind of compete against each other.
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:35.040]   Oita prefecture on Kyushu has two major onsen towns.
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:40.680]   One's called Beppu, and one's called Fuin.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:44.400]   Both have a ton of places to stay.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:47.320]   There's an international university in Beppu,
[01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:48.520]   and a lot of people that go there
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:50.000]   work in some of these hotels,
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.280]   so the level of English in Beppu is better than in Tokyo,
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.040]   which is very confusing.
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:58.160]   And you can choose from a variety of types of properties.
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:00.840]   There's an intercontinental in Beppu, for example,
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:03.720]   if you want the comfort of something familiar,
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:06.440]   or you can go all the way down to a very traditional inn
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:08.040]   while you're sleeping on tatami.
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:10.000]   If you've ever looked at a photo of Beppu,
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.480]   it looks like it's exploding.
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:14.560]   There's just steam coming up from every vent
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.840]   as you walk down the street.
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:17.720]   It's really cool.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.920]   Yufuin is in the mountains,
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:21.720]   and it's a little bit more rural.
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:24.280]   Major tourism destination as well,
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:28.640]   as far as onsen and hot springs culture goes.
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:32.640]   There is a very prescribed way that you soak in onsen.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:35.200]   You must wash yourself before you go in,
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:37.120]   and you must be naked,
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:39.400]   and if that's uncomfortable for you,
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:44.400]   IHG hotels have a variety of hot spring hybrid hotels
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.920]   all throughout the country.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:49.000]   I would just look at their Japan offerings.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.720]   They have a property in Hakone, for example,
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.680]   that you can go in your bathing suit,
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:55.680]   and you can go, if you're traveling
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.560]   with someone of the opposite gender,
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:00.520]   you can also go and bathe together.
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:01.760]   - I'm gonna give the opposite advice,
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.560]   which is if you're uncomfortable with it,
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.880]   try to get comfortable with it.
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:09.320]   - Oh yeah, I am all about the real onsen experience.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.280]   - You're right, I shouldn't just give the caveat.
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:14.880]   Absolutely dive in headfirst, pun intended.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:17.120]   This is absolutely something that you can try,
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.640]   and in the way that you always see in the news
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:21.440]   every once in a while, like so-and-so,
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.760]   oldest man in the world,
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:26.400]   what is his secret to living 'til 126?
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:30.600]   So many of these people are from Kyushu, from Beppu,
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.120]   and they all talk about how hot spring culture
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.880]   is so important to them,
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:38.760]   and it's so profound and widespread in Oita Prefecture
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:41.160]   that a lot of houses don't have running water
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:43.200]   because they have an onsen down the street,
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:45.040]   and every morning and every evening,
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:47.280]   they go and soak and they talk with their friends.
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:50.600]   There's a major social component to this as well.
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.400]   - That sounds like a place that I've never been
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:53.240]   and want to go.
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:56.680]   It left off Hakone 'cause we did go there on an early trip,
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:59.400]   and it's beautiful, Mount Fuji in the background.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:00.280]   It was wonderful.
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:03.120]   Any other thoughts on whether a day trip
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:05.160]   or a side trip from Tokyo or Kyoto,
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:07.620]   or even flight somewhere else, or train?
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:11.000]   - Yeah, I think you're on the right track
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.560]   with a trip out to Hakone.
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:15.280]   It's just this weird prescribed thing
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:17.640]   that a lot of operators have people do,
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:20.520]   and it's just become this sort of golden circle thing
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:22.520]   where you're like, "Okay, I'm gonna Tokyo and Hakone,
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:25.600]   "and then Kyoto, and we're done."
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:29.240]   Outside of Hakone, in the greater Fuji area,
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:31.760]   there are some incredible places to stay
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:36.240]   and some incredibly beautiful and natural environments.
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:38.880]   There's the five Fuji lakes.
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.560]   I would have a look into those.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:43.520]   Those are nestled right under the mountain,
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.700]   all have incredible views.
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:48.280]   That is something that's specifically different
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:50.840]   than the Hakone experience.
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:55.840]   I really like Shuzenji as a little town.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.920]   There's a really cool place to stay there,
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:01.680]   a couple cool places, ranging from budget to high end.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:05.560]   This is small town Japan, and it's really close to Tokyo.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:10.560]   North of Tokyo is Nikko, a major UNESCO site.
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:12.600]   A lot of people, for some reason,
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:15.280]   do it as a day trip from Tokyo.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.600]   Do not do it as a day trip.
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:20.000]   It is so far, you will be tired,
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.220]   and you're missing the beauty of it,
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:24.280]   which is the evening after all the crowds are gone.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.440]   You can go see the UNESCO protected sites,
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:29.800]   but for me, Lake Shuzenji is stunning,
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:31.240]   and there are a few really cool places
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.680]   to stay on the lake there.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:35.680]   Though a big question that I get is,
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:38.040]   how do I do Kyoto without going to Kyoto?
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:40.680]   Because the crowds, there's already conversations
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:44.800]   about how to curb overcrowding in Kyoto.
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:47.640]   So a lot of people are opting to go to Kanazawa
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:50.000]   instead of Kyoto.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.720]   Kanazawa, back in feudal times,
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.280]   different feudal entities measured their wealth by rice,
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:58.720]   how much rice they were making.
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:00.520]   Rice was currency.
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:03.800]   And after the stronghold in Kyoto,
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:07.280]   Kanazawa, the Maeda clan, were the second wealthiest.
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:10.920]   There's a lot of that old culture still intact.
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:13.680]   One of the most beautiful gardens in all of Japan,
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:15.640]   and the Japanese rank their gardens,
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:17.760]   and there are three that are considered the nicest,
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:19.760]   and one of them is in Kanazawa.
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:23.060]   This is that little Kyoto that you're gonna get
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:24.360]   with far less people.
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:27.500]   It's much smaller, but if you're allergic to crowds,
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:28.720]   this is the place for you.
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:31.880]   And Kaga Prefecture, the area around it,
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:36.040]   is also a teeming onsen destination.
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.040]   I have mixed feelings about Hokkaido.
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:40.840]   Grew up in Canada, I was born with skis on,
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:43.160]   love a good ski trip.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:46.080]   Hokkaido has japao, incredible powder.
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.840]   I have really mixed feelings about going to Japan
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:49.840]   for the skiing.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:52.680]   I think you can get great skiing in Canada.
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:55.320]   You can get great skiing in the US.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:36:00.120]   I think it's a bit of a shame to devote your Japanese holiday
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:03.640]   to something that you can do really well in other places.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:08.400]   So I'm a bit allergic to recommending a ski trip
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:09.680]   with your Japan trip.
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.360]   Instead, I would pick places that you're really getting
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:14.320]   culturally fulfilled.
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.520]   We love to ski.
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:18.480]   We have not done skiing in Japan for that reason.
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.080]   I think a part of us is like, "Oh, it'd be so interesting
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:24.920]   to do that, but how could we prioritize that over all..."
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:27.680]   I don't think I've ever been to all these amazing
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.520]   other prefectures, islands even.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:30.760]   We've stayed so central.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:33.480]   Gosh, I feel like there is an infinite more Japan
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:34.320]   for us to see.
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.520]   The fact that you feel the same way after 20 years
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:40.280]   makes me feel like it'll just be on the rotation constantly.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:42.840]   And it's probably the country we've been to the most
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.600]   other than of course, where we live.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:47.680]   Any other final thoughts, tips,
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:49.080]   things that you have on your notes
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:51.800]   that maybe we should have said earlier, but didn't,
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:53.200]   that are worth sharing?
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:54.520]   I think we're pretty...
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:56.320]   I have a couple of random ones.
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.240]   Okay, go.
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:00.520]   So one, shopping is fantastic,
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:05.520]   but if you are in any way very tall in the US,
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.840]   it is a very interesting experience.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.960]   I think I'm like a 2XL.
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:13.960]   I couldn't find any shoes and pants fit me like capris,
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.360]   and I'm only six feet tall.
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.040]   So keep that in mind when shopping,
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:21.160]   because it could be a difficult experience if you fall.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.160]   My brother-in-law basically couldn't buy anything
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.880]   because he was so tall.
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:27.120]   So that was one on the general side.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:29.000]   We didn't talk at all about Osaka,
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.240]   but I would say, as you mentioned
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.760]   before we started recording,
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:34.080]   it's known as the food city,
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:36.000]   but the entire country is a food country.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.200]   So you don't necessarily need to go there
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.200]   and go out of your way.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:42.880]   But if you are there, fantastic Okonomiyaki.
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.160]   I believe Osaka is kind of known for it.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.800]   That's a thing to hit up there.
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:49.280]   And there's a bar in Osaka called Bible Club,
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.960]   which was one of the coolest like speakeasy-ish bars
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:54.080]   I've ever been to.
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.240]   And I'd put that on your list.
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:59.040]   I would also just add that,
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:01.560]   this is maybe something that you don't want to hear.
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:06.000]   It is the best place to just indulge
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.480]   in the joy of exploration.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:11.800]   And it can be really hard for FOMOists,
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:14.560]   but you're not going to go wrong.
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:17.400]   You can go to New York City and go wrong.
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:20.440]   You could end up at an Olive Garden by accident.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:21.280]   You know what I mean?
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:23.360]   I always want to tell readers of my guidebook,
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:28.280]   go to Ebisu Station in Tokyo and go to Ebisu Yokocho.
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:29.120]   You can Google it.
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.120]   You'll find where it is.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:35.040]   It is like a little kind of street foodie indoor area
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:37.360]   and just pick one of the stalls.
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:39.480]   You're going to see, they all cook one thing.
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:41.400]   What's the thing that looks delicious to you?
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.960]   Rather than hyper-focusing on the one place
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:45.960]   that you have to go,
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:49.840]   there are tens of thousands of restaurants to choose from.
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.480]   So many of them are incredible.
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:55.240]   It's such a great destination to come home and say,
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:56.440]   I found this place.
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:58.160]   You get to have a little bit of ownership
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:59.560]   over your own experience.
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:00.920]   Certainly talk to your friends
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:01.880]   about the things that they've done.
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:04.200]   Certainly go to the places that we're recommending here,
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:07.160]   but take the opportunity to add serendipity
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:08.040]   into your schedule.
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:10.520]   It's the best country to do it.
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.040]   - I love that recommendation.
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:14.440]   Half of the recommendations I have
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.320]   are just places we randomly found.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.560]   Certainly the rest of them might be things
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:21.800]   that we found in books or on tabloid or anything.
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:23.720]   The one last thing I'm going to ask you
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:27.080]   is because someone wrote in and asked about Naoshima Island,
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.800]   do you have any thoughts on visiting there?
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:34.800]   - So the Satoshi Inland Sea has a lot of different islands.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:38.160]   And if you dip into the history of how that all came about,
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:39.560]   it's really fascinating.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:42.400]   It's a really compelling conservation project
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:46.920]   to redevelop a destination that was deemed undesirable.
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:49.160]   Rather than just having a pit stop,
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:52.920]   I would recommend going to a variety
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:55.480]   of the different islands in that area.
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:57.840]   It's a really upcoming destination,
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:01.240]   not just because of all the art that's there,
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:04.000]   but new and interesting hotels are being built.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:09.000]   There's a big push to keep populations in smaller places
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.200]   and not have everyone move to Tokyo or Osaka.
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.640]   There's a lot of government money that's being spent,
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:16.360]   and that is one of the destinations
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:18.640]   that's continuing to grow.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.160]   So I would expand your holiday there
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:23.320]   rather than it just being a beat.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.320]   - I haven't been there,
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:27.360]   so that's yet one more thing to put on the list
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:28.520]   for the next trip,
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.920]   which if we're going to try to do it without kids,
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:32.800]   it's going to be shorter than we wanted
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:34.520]   or farther away in the future.
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:37.000]   So this has been amazing.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.920]   As I think to the future of episodes like this,
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.440]   I'm going to start to wonder whether it makes sense
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.800]   to try to do a country.
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.160]   It was always a gamble whether we do countries or cities.
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:48.760]   So I appreciate you indulging in this crazy idea.
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:52.480]   And obviously you've written blog posts, articles,
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:55.120]   stories, guidebooks, all about Japan.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.840]   Where can people stay on top of everything you're doing
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.280]   and everything you're up to?
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:01.840]   - I write for a variety of different publications.
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.280]   So I keep an archive of those articles
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:05.920]   at brandonpresser.com.
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.000]   I'm active on my Instagram,
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.520]   shooting real-time photos of the destinations that I'm in.
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:13.720]   My handle is @brandpress,
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:16.440]   the first five letters of my first name and last name.
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:19.000]   And you can find all of my stories on Japan
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.480]   in every publication from Travel and Leisure,
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:24.640]   Bloomberg, Cunningham's Traveler, The Daily Beast,
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:25.640]   and so forth.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:28.320]   And I'll send them your way so that you can have a look.
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:29.160]   - That's awesome.
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:30.400]   We'll put some of those in the show notes.
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:33.000]   But I asked Brandon what would make this a huge win for him
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.120]   for coming on for an hour.
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:36.680]   And on the recording, Mark, we're almost at two.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:37.520]   And he said, "You know what?
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:38.960]   "I post a lot of cool stuff on Instagram.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:40.600]   "I'd love more people to see that."
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:43.160]   So if you're listening, go check out his Instagram.
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:46.440]   If you like to be inspired by awesome photos of travels,
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:47.760]   give him a follow.
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:50.400]   And if you wanna hear some crazy stories,
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.080]   when we had him on last time, we talked about his book
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.560]   about the wild pirate craziness
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:57.400]   of the history of the Pitcairn Islands.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:59.240]   Go back and listen to our episode.
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:01.160]   We not only talked about traveling,
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:03.360]   like a local and not just a tourist
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:04.960]   and some crazy other things about travel,
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:07.120]   but we talked about some of the crazy stories from that.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.240]   It's an awesome book.
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.960]   Definitely check that out too.
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:12.640]   Brandon, thank you for staying on for so long
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:14.280]   and being here today.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:15.120]   - It was my pleasure.
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:16.240]   There's so much fun.
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:20.800]   - Wow, I have never been so excited for a trip
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:22.240]   that I'm not even planning yet
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:25.080]   than I am right now for taking my next trip to Japan.
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:27.200]   And by the way, I've been there four times
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:29.120]   and I'm still so excited.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:31.440]   So I have no idea when we're gonna get to do it
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:33.640]   because I think we're still a little bit overwhelmed
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:36.440]   about traveling with two kids after going to Europe.
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:38.160]   But I am really, really excited.
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.000]   I hope you liked this episode.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.840]   I hope if you haven't been considering the trip to Japan,
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:44.080]   you are now.
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:45.400]   And if you're already considering it,
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.720]   I hope you're sold and you're ready to go.
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:49.320]   And I know I said that I wanna make sure
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:51.200]   these episodes include a section
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:53.120]   about how to get there with points and miles,
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.040]   how to book flights, where to get the best deals,
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:57.520]   where to stay in hotels
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:59.400]   and where the best deals for points are there,
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:02.000]   as well as any other deals and hacks I've learned
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:02.920]   or collected.
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:05.680]   So I'm gonna release a bonus episode on Friday
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:07.840]   that'll cover all of those things
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.600]   and I really hope you enjoy it.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.480]   But also, please let me know what you think
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:13.400]   of these travel episodes in general
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:14.760]   because I know it's a little bit different
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.000]   from what I've done in the past 100 episodes.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.720]   And I know that not everyone is looking to travel to Japan.
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:22.840]   So I am curious what you think, would love feedback.
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.720]   And I've got a couple of these planned,
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:26.000]   but I am really trying to decide
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.480]   whether I make this a monthly thing
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:29.880]   and also whether we try to tackle a country
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:31.880]   or just really go deep on a city.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:34.920]   So I've got another one I've recorded with Lee Rowan
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:36.640]   on everything about Italy.
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:39.160]   But after that, I really wanna try to decide what's best.
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:40.600]   So please let me know what you think,
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:43.880]   please send feedback and thank you so much for joining.
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:44.720]   See you Friday.
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:47.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:49.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:52.460]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:44:02.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
