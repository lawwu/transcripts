[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.560]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.520]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.520]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.720]   and one of the areas I love optimizing the most is travel.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.120]   I've been to 60 plus countries, and on every trip,
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.720]   I love meeting locals, trying to understand their culture,
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.200]   having authentic experiences, and most of all,
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.680]   I love finding a way to eat all the best foods
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.000]   a place has to offer.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.720]   And hands down, one of my favorite travel destinations
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.140]   in the world is Japan.
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.880]   So I wanted to do another travel episode
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.440]   on just traveling there.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.120]   And while I've been there four times,
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.700]   there is no one better to join me
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.920]   than my previous guest, Brandon Presser,
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.200]   who's been there every year for the past 20 years,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.600]   except 2021, including spending a month there last November.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.960]   He's also lived there twice,
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.640]   and he's written three books on the country.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.780]   He is a true expert on Japan,
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.320]   but he's also been to over 100 countries
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.480]   and written well over 50 guidebooks,
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.560]   so he is actually an all-around travel pro as well.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.040]   We're gonna talk about why we both love the country so much,
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.140]   what makes it worth a visit, where you should go,
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.720]   what you should see and do, and my favorite,
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.640]   all the incredible foods you should be trying
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.720]   and our favorite spots to eat them.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.760]   I hope that by the time you finish this episode,
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.220]   whether you've never been to Japan,
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.020]   have a trip on the horizon, or have been before,
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.960]   you're gonna be inspired to go there soon
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.120]   and have a ton of amazing new things to check out
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.120]   when you get there.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.500]   So let's get into it right after this.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.680]   Brandon, thank you so much for being here a second time.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.880]   - Thank you so much for having me.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.200]   - You've traveled to so many countries.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.860]   What is it about Japan that keeps bringing you back?
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.600]   - So the thing about Japan, for me,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.200]   is that the more time you spend there,
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.480]   the more you realize you don't know
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.320]   the destination that well.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.880]   And every time I go back,
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.280]   there's always a new thing to explore,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.400]   there's always a theme that needs unpacking,
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.720]   and it's one of those places
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.640]   that it's not like in New York,
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.600]   where you get to live there for 10 years
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.880]   and then you get to say you're a New Yorker.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.520]   The more time you spend, the more you're like,
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.800]   "Wow, I'm not from here."
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.440]   - This is coming from someone who's lived there twice
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.440]   and been there well over a dozen times, so that's wild.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.160]   What is so different about Japan?
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.840]   - I've heard a lot of people call Japan
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.780]   a Galapagos economy.
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.100]   What that essentially means is that it's a country
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.400]   that has modernized and evolved
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.880]   away from the rest of the world.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.360]   So a lot of the systems that are in place,
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.640]   a lot of the ways that we perceive the modern world
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.600]   are just slightly alternate universe.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.920]   And I think that's what makes Japan
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.080]   so interesting and special.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.560]   - Can you give some examples?
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.520]   - Absolutely.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.160]   One of the most important things to note
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.080]   about Japan and Japanese culture
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.320]   is that they have this proclivity
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.520]   for taking something from another country
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.720]   and then improving upon it.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.200]   And so ramen is the best example of that.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   So it's a Chinese dish,
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.520]   became really popular after World War II,
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.320]   was called Chinese noodles.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.560]   And then the recipe started to change and started to evolve.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.520]   And then it became ramen,
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.680]   which we all conceive of as distinctly Japanese.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.440]   And the other example is toilets brought by the West.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.960]   And as many of us know,
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.500]   they now can sing you happy birthday while you're using them
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.700]   and have all sorts of water features.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.260]   - Yeah, have a Japanese toilet.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.860]   We've talked about how to get a deal on a Japanese toilet
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.940]   on this show before.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.780]   And I totally agree.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.260]   It's funny, I've been to Japan a few times
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.080]   and people are like,
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.500]   "Oh, you gotta check out this place for pizza."
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.540]   And I'm like, "Why would I get pizza in Japan?
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.380]   That seems crazy."
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.220]   And it's like, "No, no, no."
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.220]   Because Japan takes everything
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.220]   and tries to make the best possible version you can of it.
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.100]   There was a pizzeria in Napoletana Dayuki in,
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.340]   I think, Kyoto.
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.820]   And the person who started it went to Italy,
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.860]   trained, brought back everything,
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.540]   and has tried to master the pizza in every way possible.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.860]   And the same is true about coffee
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.480]   and the list goes on forever.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.460]   Whenever my wife and I come back, we're like,
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.180]   "I feel like we just came back from the future."
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.140]   In this world where everything was improved and thought of
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.600]   in a rational and logical way.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.500]   So I am so excited to dig in here.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.220]   I'm so excited to go back to Japan.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.740]   You are one of the people I know who's been
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.820]   since it reopened.
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.540]   What was it like in a kind of post-pandemic world?
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.980]   Well, much in the way that Japan always feels
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.820]   like this wonderful trip to the future.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.740]   And I often, when I return from Japan,
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.240]   have sort of reverse culture shock.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.560]   When I get back to the US, I'm like,
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.460]   "Oh, this country is so disappointing relative to Japan."
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.460]   What was interesting about my trip to Japan this time
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.300]   was it felt a little bit like a visit to the recent past.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.980]   Their relationship with COVID has been very different
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.300]   than in the US.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.380]   Everyone is still masking, even outdoors, even on a hike,
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.020]   I would pass people who are still wearing
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.780]   their masks outside.
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.500]   And we can kind of dig into why that is
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.420]   and how certain cultural things kind of inform that.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.260]   But there is a lot of COVID fear.
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.240]   When I was there, a lot of people asked me,
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.460]   "Is this your first trip out of America?"
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.820]   since the pandemic.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.740]   And I think Japan was maybe my 15th country
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.460]   since we've torn away the veil of the pandemic.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.380]   So in that sense, it was this odd revisiting
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.140]   of the trauma of the pandemic and the fear.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.140]   But what's also really interesting about Japan
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.100]   is we're now post-Olympics.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.660]   And that is something to really consider as well,
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.620]   'cause it was sort of the Olympics that never happened.
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.820]   There were high hopes for the Games.
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.380]   The last time that Japan had the Olympics was in 1964.
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.620]   And that was really fascinating
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.060]   'cause it was the first Olympic Games
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.940]   that were televised around the world.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.060]   And it was to signal that Japan was this fresh,
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.420]   newly modern country, post-World War II,
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.860]   a lot of really interesting modern architecture
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.740]   happening as the backdrop.
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.260]   So they were kind of hoping to replicate that magic.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.700]   And of course, that never happened.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.540]   But how the Olympics actually are informing Japan
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.900]   is we're seeing a lot of little Western tweaks.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.660]   English is a lot better than it was a few years ago.
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.900]   And we're also seeing much more credit card use
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.100]   than we did before.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.380]   Little things like that.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.700]   - But things are open.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.780]   You are able to go see stuff, do stuff,
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:35.780]   eat stuff, drink stuff.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.540]   So just because there might be a feel
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.580]   like you're back in the past,
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.540]   I would say was still,
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.660]   you could go to Japan right now
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.900]   and have an amazing experience
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.100]   and do all the things you'd done before.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.780]   - Absolutely, I highly recommend it.
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.580]   If you're okay still wearing a mask out of courtesy,
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.180]   I would get on the plane tomorrow
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.180]   and you're gonna have an absolutely incredible experience.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.180]   Everyone's excited for people to be coming back.
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.340]   Restaurants are fully operational.
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.420]   You know, if you saw in the news,
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.060]   a lot of travel articles that were like,
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.980]   go before the crowds, get back to Japan before the crowds,
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.140]   that's fake news.
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.180]   The crowds are back in full force
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.940]   and Chinese tourists are gonna start heading back
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.980]   now as well.
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.700]   And even without the Chinese tourists
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.340]   who make up about 40 to 50% of the tourism in Japan,
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.700]   everything was rammed.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.900]   All the favorite temples in Kyoto were packed with people.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.700]   You absolutely needed reservations at popular restaurants.
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.420]   So everything's back in full swing.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.340]   - Okay, well, let's talk about that trip.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.820]   When I did my first episode to London,
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.100]   I just picked a city.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.580]   And I was like, oh, that's pretty easy.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.820]   I'm getting a little ambitious here.
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.740]   We're gonna talk about an entire country.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.140]   So instead of trying to go through every destination
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.340]   in the country, that would be impossible.
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.940]   We would have to record for the next, I don't know, week
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.260]   or based on your experience, maybe for the next 20 years.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.140]   But let's say someone's thinking
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.660]   about how to take that first trip for one, two weeks.
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.180]   What would you give them the advice of how to go,
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.540]   where to go, all of that?
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.340]   - Yeah, so I would think about trip planning to Japan
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.660]   the way that I think about trip planning
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.740]   to every destination.
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.620]   Think of your trip as a meal.
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.660]   Think about you have your appetizer,
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.540]   your main course, and your dessert.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.660]   So the appetizer is like you're getting into the vibe
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.060]   of the destination.
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.060]   You're doing a little sampling, maybe tasting a few things.
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.820]   Really, you're getting over the jet lag.
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.300]   And so when you, by the time you transition
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.300]   to the main course, that's like the real showstopper.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.660]   That's the meat.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.740]   And then the dessert is gonna be the thing
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.580]   where you really treat yourself.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:37.380]   Save that really fun, cool thing until the end.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.940]   And I'm not someone who suffers from FOMO,
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.940]   but I am sort of crippled by the optimizer's dilemma.
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.780]   Like I wanna make sure that I've had
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.420]   the best trip possible for me.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.580]   And Japan is one of those places where there's
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.140]   just so many different variations on the theme.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.340]   I think the two places that you absolutely have to hit
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.540]   are Tokyo and Kyoto.
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.500]   And then you can kind of mix and match a variety
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.860]   of secondary destinations based on your personal interest.
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:14.700]   I wouldn't be a slave to, well, everyone else is going here
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.140]   or everyone else is going there.
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.460]   I think critically about what is interesting
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.820]   to you about Japan.
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.300]   And we're gonna go through some of those different
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.700]   destinations and themes and kind of pick a mix from there
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:32.100]   and then end with your splurge where you're kind of
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.420]   really soaking in maybe a traditional inn, a ryokan,
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.220]   having that quintessential Japanese hospitality experience
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.020]   where you're not leaving the hotel,
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:48.020]   but just basking in that incredible design, food,
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.780]   everything that we know from the country.
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:50.820]   - Hospitality.
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.820]   - That omotenashi, yeah.
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.020]   - Just high level, what are a few of those places
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.380]   outside of Tokyo and Kyoto that you'd put on the list?
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.460]   - I would think that you would wanna get four elements
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.500]   on your trip.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:06.500]   You wanna do new, old, mountain, sea.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.060]   Those are the four things that I think that you should
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.220]   check off your list for every trip to Japan,
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.860]   whether it's your first or whether it's your fourth.
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.100]   And old and new can be in different cities.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.300]   They are always looking ahead into the future
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:26.380]   while also cherishing their cultural and historical relics.
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.300]   And then you need to remember that Japan
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.620]   is on the Pacific Ring of Fire.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.460]   There are still active volcanoes.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.900]   The country's incredibly hilly, mountainous,
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.100]   and then you have these beautiful sea moments,
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:48.100]   bays, lakes, and putting that all together is just perfect.
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.020]   - Are there specific places you're like, get to them,
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.460]   but here's a cool place, there's a cool place
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.460]   to get people excited?
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:00.020]   - Yeah, so think of Japan as having four major islands.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:04.100]   And Tokyo and Kyoto are on the main island, Honshu,
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.100]   and I would absolutely add one of the other islands
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.940]   to your itinerary.
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.420]   So Kyushu in the south, you're getting active volcanoes,
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.980]   you're getting onsen culture, this hot spring culture.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.580]   This is a really hot emerging destination
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.460]   that I absolutely recommend.
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.780]   I can give you some specifics a little later on.
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.460]   Shikoku is the quietest of the four.
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.700]   These are small villages, a lot of farming,
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.460]   and that is where you're gonna really have
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.620]   that rural experience where you can go stay with a family
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.980]   and really embed in the culture
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.780]   in a very different, humble way.
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.740]   And then you have Hokkaido in the north.
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.220]   Think of Japan as a lowercase J.
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.940]   Hokkaido is the dot at the top.
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.140]   And that is really famous internationally
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.040]   as a skiing destination.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.580]   But I would challenge you to consider it
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.260]   as just a beautiful, natural destination
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.860]   and a place that's really worth going even in the summer
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.220]   for those mountains on steroids,
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.340]   these huge expanses of wilderness,
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.380]   but still with that Japanese sensibility.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.220]   - I love it.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.720]   Okay, we're gonna get to a lot of this.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.040]   I'm very sad that I don't have a Japan trip on the horizon.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.940]   Best times, is there a time you think people
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.260]   should be planning their trip to Japan?
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.500]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.960]   I like to avoid the summer.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.940]   And that is not necessarily
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.640]   because that's when you have the most crowds,
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.620]   but surely a lot of people in their summer holidays
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.080]   are gonna end up in Japan.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.060]   But it is desperately humid.
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.020]   When I used to live in Japan and I worked,
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.420]   my boss used to make me keep clothes at work
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.580]   so that after I would take the metro to the office,
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.180]   I would have fresh clothes to change into
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.100]   'cause I would inevitably be sweaty.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.900]   July and August are upsettingly hot and humid.
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.860]   And so much of Japan,
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.340]   even though you're thinking about taking trains
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.160]   and all of this, so much is exploring by walking.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.480]   So you wanna be comfortable.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.580]   Obviously, there's cherry blossom season that's world famous
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.760]   and you're gonna get all of the crowds.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.740]   Is it worth the hype?
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.960]   Absolutely, it is totally stunning.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.900]   There are cherry blossoms all over the country.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.060]   You don't necessarily need to be in Tokyo or Kyoto
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.880]   to see them.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.900]   My favorite time to go is in the fall
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.700]   because in the way that cherry blossom season is revered,
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.900]   so is the fall in Koyo, as it's called, leaf peeping.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.260]   So you get these beautiful red Japanese maples.
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.420]   I think November for me is my favorite time to visit.
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.420]   - We went in December 2019 with my family
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.460]   right before COVID came.
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.860]   And it was awesome because it wasn't that crowded,
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.140]   but it's not that cold.
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.120]   We didn't go to Hokkaido, it would have been cold,
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.820]   but in most of the rest of the country,
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.020]   it's not unbearably cold.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:43.860]   It was a little cheaper
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.940]   because people aren't traveling in cold cities as much,
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.200]   but I had a great time.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.840]   It was a little easier to get into things.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.420]   It wasn't that crowded.
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.460]   Any other kind of high level logistics?
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.120]   Do you think people need a guide?
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.760]   Someone wrote to me and I'll ask you and share my opinion,
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.600]   but they're like,
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.560]   should they be nervous if they only speak English?
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.340]   Anything like that?
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.720]   - I think that the English has massively improved
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.040]   over the last 10 years,
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.900]   especially with the anticipated nudge of the Olympics.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.660]   There were a lot of people that were taking English classes
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.720]   and that has really changed.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.320]   Does it compare to other countries?
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.660]   No, I think that there's still a lack of English
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.960]   compared to a place like Thailand, say.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.240]   But I think you are gonna be fine going around on your own.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.760]   And I think experiencing at least parts of your trip
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.040]   on your own is hugely rewarding,
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.040]   much more rewarding than in a lot of other destinations,
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.600]   simply because the quality of everything is so high
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.440]   that it's a destination that really lends itself
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.060]   to discovery.
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.300]   Walking into a random restaurant
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.220]   will probably be pretty darn good.
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.960]   - We've done Japan four times.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.120]   I speak like three words of Japanese
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.440]   and we had no guides ever any of those times.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.400]   So I typically tell people,
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.420]   look, you might need to speak a little slower.
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.400]   You might need to point.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.360]   You might need to just accept that you'd just be surprised.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.480]   But I don't think there's a country in the world
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.040]   that I've found that you can't go to
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.280]   because you don't speak the language.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.460]   So I don't think that should be a barrier for anyone,
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.920]   but I've gotten a bunch of emails asking if it is,
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.800]   so I wanted to make sure we cover it.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.560]   And last, any tips you have
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.920]   since you've been there so many times
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.760]   to save money on setting everything up in advance?
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.200]   - Well, there's two things that I always think about
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.040]   when I'm planning a trip to Japan.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:35.040]   I think we all wanna do a bit of pre-arrival research
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.680]   for some of our specifics.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.980]   It's a country that is very crowded.
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.720]   It's a country that's getting a lot of tourists.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.280]   So you do want to plan a little bit in advance
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.280]   as far as what you're gonna eat, where you're gonna stay.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.760]   And one of the things that's very culturally different
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.320]   than Japan and the West is rating things.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.800]   So giving stars on Google or on Yelp or things like that.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.240]   In our culture, we're very hyperbolic.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.760]   We have a nice experience, we give it a five.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.600]   We have a bad experience, we give it a one.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.880]   Everything kind of always ends up netting out
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:14.000]   to be like a 4.2 or something like that at a place.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.600]   In Japan, you have a nice experience, you give it a three.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.800]   So what can be really confusing at the onset
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.880]   is someone could tell you,
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.440]   "Oh my God, I love this restaurant.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.280]   "It's so great and cool."
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.700]   And you go onto Google to see the review
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.080]   that has been given and it's average is like a 3.6.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.040]   And you're like, "What?
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.220]   "I would never eat at a place that's a 3.6."
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:38.220]   Well, in Japan, 3.6 is excellent.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.880]   And in the food category,
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:46.160]   I wanna send you right away to Tabalog.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.920]   It's a website that is their Yelp,
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.000]   but it's taken very seriously.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.760]   People use it prolifically.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.780]   And with your translator button on,
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.240]   you can navigate it without any problems.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.880]   And you can search by type of food
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.240]   and you can search by destination
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.040]   and really make some informed decisions bearing in mind
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.080]   that really stellar restaurants
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.960]   are gonna have like a 3.8 or a 3.7.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.680]   And then you can also use the rating
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.720]   to gauge where Japanese people are going
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.120]   and where tourists are going.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.680]   And this goes for other things
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.320]   like hotels and sites and bars.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.900]   If it has kind of a low score,
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.500]   Japanese people are going there.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.500]   If it has an inflated score,
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.380]   you know that it's more frequented by foreigners.
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.980]   - Funny, it's like you find a place on Google Maps,
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:34.980]   it's like 4.9.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.100]   You're like, "Steer clear, there's no way you got here."
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.540]   - Exactly, "Don't go here, only Americans are going there."
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.620]   - Oh, that's so funny.
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.860]   What about other things about the culture
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.740]   that people might wanna know about going there?
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.500]   How would you describe Japanese people and the culture
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.380]   and things people should be aware of?
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.000]   - Yeah, I wanna take a beat to talk about
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.180]   how we would relate to Japanese culture.
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.740]   So a lot of people talk about
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.540]   how the Japanese hospitality is like no other,
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.420]   and there's this notion of a motonashi,
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.020]   which is service from the heart.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.420]   And I hear that buzzword a lot in luxury travel
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.380]   when I work with different hotels all over the world.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.840]   They wanna telegraph that they have
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.380]   this elevated sense of hospitality.
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.100]   But what you need to understand about Japanese culture
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.560]   is when you engage with a hospitality product,
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.520]   there's an unspoken social contract
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.800]   where you are also the deferential guest.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.840]   So the idea of the customer is always right
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.660]   doesn't really exist in Japanese culture.
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:44.660]   You are expected to be as well-behaved and as nice
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.820]   as the restaurant staff will be to you.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.580]   And that is kind of a product of Japan
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:59.580]   being a culture of shame rather than a culture of guilt.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:04.420]   In the West, we think about Catholic guilt or Jewish guilt.
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.100]   I think we all have a pretty good sense of what that means
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.720]   if we have all experienced it.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.640]   In Japan, it's more how everyone else is perceiving you.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.820]   So you are kind of internalizing your own actions
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.020]   and making choices about your behavior
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.060]   based on how everyone else perceives you
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.900]   rather than that moral compass inside
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.580]   telling you what's right or wrong.
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.700]   I know it's like a bit lofty,
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.440]   but you are working as a guest
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.860]   in the way that staff are working to serve you.
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.380]   - We were at a nice steakhouse in Tokyo once.
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.660]   And I remember one of us spilled
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.380]   our glass of wine on the table.
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.500]   We'd been in Japan for a week
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.020]   and we had internalized this feeling you're describing.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:45.860]   And it was like, oh my gosh,
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.060]   should we just leave the restaurant?
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.060]   Like, can we even stay here after that?
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.740]   We felt so horrible.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.380]   Everyone was kind of like looking at us like,
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.900]   how could you do that?
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.780]   I feel like I know what you mean.
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.580]   Fortunately, we recovered.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.060]   We apologized profusely and it was okay.
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.700]   But I have experienced that feeling and it's very different.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.780]   - You don't want to be late.
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.720]   You don't want to be late to your reservation.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.900]   You don't want to be late to meet your guide.
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.340]   And that's part of the social contract as well.
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.860]   Also, you might find funny quirks
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.700]   where if you're staying at a luxury hotel
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.220]   and the staff wants to know
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.060]   what time you're gonna have breakfast in the morning,
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.580]   you could say, oh, I don't know, 9 a.m.
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.660]   But they might come back to you and say, 8.30 is better.
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.960]   Don't be surprised if they are going to really hold you
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.100]   to that social contract and kind of tweak your experience.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.300]   But it's all so that they can serve you better.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.900]   - They're suggesting 8.30 'cause at nine it's crowded
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.340]   and you might not get the best table
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.900]   or your food might be slow or something like that.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.940]   And on the sense of punctuality,
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.340]   definitely don't be late to trains either.
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.380]   I can't remember the story,
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.260]   but it was like there was one train that left seconds late
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.660]   and they issued like a national apology.
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.380]   I'm sure you know this story better than me,
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.060]   but like things are not late.
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.940]   - Yeah, so when I lived in Japan,
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.020]   I was working there and going to the office
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.900]   on days when a train would be late,
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.420]   by more than 10 seconds they would issue you
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:16.220]   a little white slip of paper, if you needed it,
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.220]   that you could bring to your boss saying,
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.460]   this is the reason that I'm late.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.940]   It is not my fault that I am late to work.
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.820]   Everything is extremely on time to the point
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.920]   where I have had tourists reach out to me,
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.120]   friends reach out to me at Tokyo Station
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.780]   wanting to get on the bullet train.
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.700]   They had bought tickets for their 9.30 bullet train
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.300]   to go to Kyoto, let's say.
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.140]   And they're like,
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.260]   "Well, I'll get to the train station 20 minutes before."
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.500]   But of course, Tokyo Station's
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.860]   one of the biggest stations in the world.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.060]   Takes about 20 minutes to get to your train
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.220]   and they missed it.
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.180]   - So last thing on culture, is it easy to meet people?
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.140]   I think one of my favorite things traveling
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.500]   is meeting locals and I find in Japan,
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.900]   either I'm doing it wrong or it's harder to do.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.420]   - It's extremely difficult
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.980]   and I don't wanna oversimplify the nuance
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.700]   of cultures of shame versus cultures of guilt.
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.940]   This is certainly nothing that we need to unpack
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.780]   more than that when we're trying to cram
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.980]   in a whole travel guide in about an hour.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.380]   But the idea is that because this social contract
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.980]   that you have with the people around you,
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.620]   it extends beyond hospitality.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.160]   It's why everyone is so polite on the trains.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.620]   It's why everyone walks on certain sides of the roads.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.520]   It's why Tokyo is the biggest city in the world
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.060]   but it feels more organized
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.440]   than any other city half its size.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.100]   The social contract sort of exists
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.620]   that you create this facade, this emote,
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.280]   where you have a side of yourself
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.380]   that you present to other people
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.740]   and then you have a more personal side
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.900]   and a more personal aspect to your personality.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.580]   So because there is this facade element,
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.600]   you are engaging with people in that manner.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.100]   Is it a fake facade?
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:55.940]   No.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.760]   Are they two-faced?
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.600]   No.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.840]   This is a true aspect of your personality
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.740]   but it's the presented aspect of your personality.
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.100]   So it's hard to have that very American,
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.380]   this is how I really feel about something.
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.340]   These are my real emotions.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.860]   Americans like to tell you when they're mad
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.420]   but they're screaming at you.
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.200]   And it's like, I get it that you're mad
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.540]   because you're yelling,
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.540]   whereas the Japanese generally are much more nuanced
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.420]   in that nature.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.580]   So it's an interesting moment
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.460]   where two cultures are touching
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.340]   that may feel limited or inauthentic
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.260]   but it's just a different version
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.860]   of how we present ourselves.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.700]   - If you had a guide
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.900]   or you met someone that worked at your hotel
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:38.740]   and you're like,
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.140]   "Hey, do you wanna grab a drink tonight after work?"
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.060]   Would that be like very surprising or shocking
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:42.980]   and met with a no?
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.140]   Or how might you go about introducing yourself to a local
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.360]   so you could get to know them
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.500]   and spend time in a casual setting?
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.380]   - Yeah, one of the things that I've discovered
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.940]   is there's actually a lot of opportunities
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.780]   to engage with people in structured ways
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.660]   that could end up leading to a friendship.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.300]   So a lot of towns all over Japan, including Tokyo,
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:08.060]   have free tours that you can sign up for.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:12.800]   And those tours are with young Japanese individuals
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.780]   who are motivated to take you around their neighborhood
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.100]   as an opportunity to practice their English
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.900]   or an opportunity to meet foreigners.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.740]   There are a lot of different websites that offer this
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:27.500]   and it's a great way to strike up a conversation
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:31.660]   with someone and use that tour opportunity
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.200]   to ask big questions
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.620]   because they are people that wanna engage with you.
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.660]   And you can use it less as,
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:42.220]   "Oh, I wanna discover Shibuya in Tokyo and see cool things,"
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.300]   but more as an opportunity
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.540]   to have that budding friendship opportunity.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.620]   I would definitely try to do one of those.
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.180]   - I love free walking tours.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.940]   I think they're a great way to get your bearings,
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:53.960]   but especially in a culture
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.060]   where it's harder to meet someone just at a bar
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.300]   and strike up a conversation.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.640]   I think it's a great recommendation.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.900]   But you mentioned a few things in Tokyo.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.100]   I wanna make sure we get to what to do.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.100]   I think let's start here
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.540]   because I assume almost anyone going to Japan
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.820]   will probably, especially on their first trip, end up here.
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.140]   It's one of the most amazing cities in the world.
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.780]   How do you think about even trying to bring it all together
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.140]   and suggest people experience it?
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.980]   - One of the funny things that I've noticed about Tokyo
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.340]   is when you ask people where they're going on holiday,
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.420]   when they're referring to a European destination,
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.020]   they usually refer to it by city.
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.180]   So, "Oh, I'm going to Paris on holiday.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.300]   "I'm going to London."
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.340]   When people talk about going to this country,
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.460]   they say Japan.
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.580]   They don't say Tokyo for some strange reason.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.500]   I'm always trying to figure out why.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.060]   And I think it's because it's so far
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.500]   and it's a lot of people's first time
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.160]   they're gonna do things beyond Tokyo,
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.940]   which makes perfect sense.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.940]   But I really want you to spend more time in Tokyo
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.500]   than you think you need.
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.060]   A trip that's three nights in Tokyo
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.220]   and three nights in Kyoto doesn't make sense to me.
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.180]   It is a city that has 40 more times
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.840]   the population than Kyoto.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:11.120]   It's a city that's four times physically bigger than Kyoto.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.780]   So even just on pure numbers,
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.300]   you shouldn't weight Tokyo equal
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.540]   to anything else in the country.
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.180]   It's a place that it has a Brooklyn.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.540]   Sure, do I need to go check out the Brooklyn?
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.860]   Sure, but there's like 12 Brooklyns.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:29.860]   And it's just this infinitely large destination
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.980]   in all the best ways.
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.420]   And it can be really tough to dig in.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.240]   So my first thing that I always tell people
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.820]   when they're trying to figure out the city
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:45.180]   is to Google Yamanote Line Google Maps.
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.380]   Don't go into Google Maps and Google it
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.460]   'cause it won't work,
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.860]   but just go to like your Google search bar
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.380]   and type Yamanote Line Google Maps.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.980]   And there's a bunch of people that have drawn
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.140]   the Yamanote Line within Tokyo.
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:04.140]   That is a Japan rail line that makes a circle
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:09.460]   around the central part of Tokyo.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:14.700]   Tokyo has 23 wards, which are kind of like boroughs.
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.100]   And this line is like a really good way
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.380]   to conceive of the city geographically.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.620]   Now think of that as a clock.
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.260]   Everything that when you hear
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:30.540]   that's like cool new neighborhoods, street fashion,
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.560]   even going back to like the early 2000s,
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.220]   like Harajuku girls and all of that,
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:40.220]   that happens at around seven to nine o'clock on the clock.
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:46.140]   Then all of the older things like Shitamachi,
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.900]   all of the Sensoji Temple,
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.700]   a lot of sort of the older touch points
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:56.700]   happen around one and two o'clock on the clock.
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.000]   And then you have the big stations
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.020]   like Shinjuku is at nine o'clock.
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.800]   Ginza, which has Tokyo Station just north of it,
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.220]   also a major hub, that's at like three o'clock.
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.760]   That's a good place to start thinking geographically
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.180]   about the city.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.260]   - Also, I will say, if you don't look at the Yamanote Line
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.860]   and you look at the entire subway map,
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.180]   it's just like sensory overload.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.860]   It's very hard to understand.
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.620]   There are multiple companies
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.180]   operating different rail lines in the city.
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.180]   In some cities, I'm like, oh, look at the subway map.
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.360]   It's a good way to orient yourself.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.020]   In Japan, I love the recommendation
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.900]   of just starting with the Yamanote Line
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.300]   because otherwise it could be pretty overwhelming.
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.140]   - Totally.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.100]   It really looks like fallen confetti in a way.
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.180]   It's all different colors.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.260]   And what's curious about it is that unlike other cities,
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.020]   it is built from a few different companies.
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:53.300]   So you have some municipal lines, the Tokyo Metro Line.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.180]   Then you have a second Metro Line.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.300]   Then you have suburban lines that were built
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:02.300]   from companies like a Sears or a Macy's.
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.140]   So strangely, they share names
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.340]   with a lot of the department stores in Tokyo.
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.760]   And you're gonna use one card
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.380]   to tap through many turnstiles
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.240]   if you're gonna go on a long trip
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.840]   all the way through the city.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.860]   And 20 years ago, you used to have to get tickets
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.900]   for each one, which was an absolute nightmare.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:26.220]   - So now, I believe it's still just the Suica card.
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.020]   You used to have to get a physical one.
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.300]   Since we won't go too much into travel logistics
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.340]   'cause it's pretty straightforward
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.420]   and the internet is full of information,
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.580]   I will just add that you can now get your Suica card
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.180]   on your iPhone or your phone in a digital wallet
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.740]   and you don't even need the physical card.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:40.940]   And you can reload it right there.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:41.940]   It was super easy.
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.820]   I will say if you're on a budget,
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.220]   it is worth paying attention
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.380]   because I think it still is true.
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.220]   Correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.000]   that if you transfer from the, is it Toyosu line
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.840]   to the JR line, you're gonna pay multiple fares.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.960]   When you do a Google Maps search from A to B,
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.840]   it'll tell you how to get there and show you the prices.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.400]   And there might be a fast route
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.600]   and there might be a cheap route
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.500]   and they might be different
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.040]   because changing different lines
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.520]   may be on different companies and have multiple fares.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.640]   - That's a really good point.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.000]   It's something that I think about when I'm there as well.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.720]   If you're really focused on your budget
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.040]   and you're traveling, say, from the central part of the city
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.580]   to Shimokitazawa, which is a really trendy,
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.460]   perennially cool neighborhood.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:27.860]   If you get off one station before Shimokitazawa
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.580]   at Yoyogi Uehara, you save about two thirds
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.620]   of the fare to get there.
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.900]   - And Google Maps is pretty good.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.180]   I don't know if there's a better app
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.660]   to find train from point A to point B.
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.700]   I believe it also tells you the fares and everything.
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:41.700]   That's what we used.
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:46.060]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:46.900]   I get it.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.620]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.500]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.560]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.500]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.460]   and let our sponsor, Drizzly,
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:04.180]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.980]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.820]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.260]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.220]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:13.700]   or maybe you just want to celebrate
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.780]   that you got through another week.
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.900]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.420]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.180]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:25.300]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.940]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:29.500]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.500]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.540]   So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.360]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.420]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.060]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.540]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.620]   So, whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.460]   or go to drizzly.com.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.480]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.720]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:00.860]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.340]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.940]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.580]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.980]   as you build your wealth.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.240]   So, I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.100]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.260]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.340]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.780]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.180]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.140]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.460]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.580]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.940]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.660]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.460]   are first generation wealth,
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.540]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.700]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.640]   and learn from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.920]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.240]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.680]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.840]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.800]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.280]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.720]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.080]   to your children's education,
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.360]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.840]   So many of these conversations
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.040]   aren't happening anywhere else online,
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.720]   so if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.580]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.700]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.820]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.940]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.460]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.420]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:30.020]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.120]   So, we're still in Tokyo.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.060]   I don't even know how we'd possibly get through all this,
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.740]   but I would love to leave people with some suggestions
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.080]   in the buckets of things to see and do,
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.840]   things to eat, maybe some nightlife.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.760]   Any thoughts on how we even start to make a dent here?
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.220]   - Yeah, so when you look at the subway map,
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.380]   it's just an, "Oh my God, I don't know how to deal with this.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.940]   "This city must be so massive."
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.060]   You can walk through a lot of the city,
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.860]   and don't be allergic to walking.
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.340]   What I love to do on my first day back in Japan
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:07.340]   is a triangle from Omotesando to Harajuku,
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.980]   and then down to Shibuya, and back again.
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.620]   You can do that triangle, and that's a really fun day.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.800]   You can take it super slow,
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.940]   and what you're getting in that area
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.540]   is a lot of the key touchpoints of the city.
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:28.540]   You're getting a lot of the rodeo drive shopping.
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.940]   Shopping in Japan, especially in Tokyo,
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.000]   is a social activity
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.780]   because there's such limited public space,
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.740]   and people have such small apartments.
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.860]   Shopping is a hanging out endeavor,
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.220]   and this is a really major thoroughfare,
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.660]   Omotesando Dori, to do that.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:52.960]   Off of that are little boutiques, and barber shops,
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.220]   and really cool things,
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.940]   those stores that we wish we all had in our hometowns.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.060]   And then you go all the way to Harajuku,
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:05.060]   the kind of bombastic hip hop meets little boat peep
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.340]   that still exists.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.300]   And right beyond that is the Meiji Shrine,
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.020]   which is absolutely worth a visit.
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.860]   And then you turn down and go to Shibuya,
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.220]   and we've all seen on "Lost in Translation"
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.740]   or in other movies, the Shibuya Crossing,
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:24.460]   the busiest pedestrian crossing in the world.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.060]   And then you can triangle your way back to Omotesando again.
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.100]   I love going to one specific restaurant.
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.300]   It is hugely popular with everyone.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.020]   It is very well known.
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.100]   It is worth the hype.
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.460]   It's called Maisen.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:43.540]   It's tonkotsu, so a breaded pork cutlet.
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:48.100]   It's 1,100 yen, which currently is about $7.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.860]   For a full meal, you're gonna have to wait in line.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:54.980]   It's in an old onsen, so in an old bathhouse
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.540]   that's been refurbished.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:57.860]   You could start with that.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.620]   It's very close to Omotesando Station,
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.060]   and then spend the afternoon walking around
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.220]   or do the morning and end with lunch there,
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.460]   bearing in mind that if you wanna go into shops,
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.980]   they tend to open a little later than you would expect.
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:13.700]   So 11 o'clock, you'll have all the stores open.
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:14.660]   - Yeah, I asked my wife, I was like,
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.900]   "What are some of your favorite tips?"
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.620]   And she's like, "Walk everywhere
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.140]   "so that you burn enough calories
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.020]   "that you can have four meals a day."
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.580]   - Absolutely, and I think what's really fun
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:27.500]   is Tokyo is not an expensive city.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.700]   Everyone talks about how it's so incredibly expensive.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.500]   It's like New York or Paris.
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.100]   It is not expensive at all.
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:37.020]   The food is bizarrely inexpensive.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.060]   Where you're gonna get dinged is on accommodation.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:44.900]   So if you wanna kind of avoid lines
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.020]   and you're really into the food,
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:52.020]   do a 10.45 first lunch and then like a 2.45 second lunch.
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.460]   That way, you'll kind of keep things pretty efficient.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.100]   I do that all the time.
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.860]   And I will say there are a lot of places,
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.500]   especially if you're going for ramen
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.700]   or something that's not a make a reservation kind of place,
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:03.780]   where you just wait in line.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.460]   Like that's just the way it works.
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.300]   And if you're going with a big group,
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.180]   you're not gonna sit down with six people
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.700]   at a lot of these small restaurants.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.340]   And so you just line up.
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.060]   I remember it's like two people went in and ate together
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:15.980]   and then one person ate.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.020]   It might not be the most social meal
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.980]   when you're going to some of these small restaurants,
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.180]   but it will probably be one of the most delicious meals.
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.780]   - And one of the other things to keep in mind,
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.940]   especially in Tokyo is don't be allergic
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.540]   to a chain restaurant.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.900]   You know, if you Google a restaurant
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.700]   that had been recommended to you,
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.620]   like a ramen place or a gyoza place,
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.540]   and oh my God, they have six locations.
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.420]   I feel like I don't wanna really do that.
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.060]   Don't be dissuaded by a chain.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.840]   The chain is usually because hospitality spaces
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.220]   are so small.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.500]   They can only serve eight people at a time
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.140]   and having a second location
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.220]   just enables them to serve more people.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.780]   Also, the city is so big that if people are traveling
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.700]   an hour to go to their favorite ramen,
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.280]   while suddenly they have a location for it closer to them,
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.280]   it's usually a sign that something's very good
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.540]   rather than it being very corporate.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.220]   - Okay, and while we're on food,
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.340]   what are a few things, dining etiquette, tipping,
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.060]   anything there that you wanna give people some overview?
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.260]   - Yeah, you absolutely don't wanna be late
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.580]   to your reservation, as we kind of unpacked before.
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.620]   I would really scout Tabalog
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:23.460]   if you want some good food recommendations
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.380]   from Japanese people.
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.800]   There is absolutely no tipping.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.580]   This isn't even a question of
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:31.260]   if someone's doing something nice
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.660]   and they're particularly good to leave them a few yen.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.980]   No, it is a non-tipping culture
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:41.860]   to the point where oftentimes, at least in the past,
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.980]   it could be perceived as rude
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.220]   because you're sort of insinuating
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.980]   that this person needs more money.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.660]   I think we may conceive of server jobs
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.900]   as being interstitial, like,
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.860]   "Well, I wanna be a singer, but I'm a server right now."
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:58.780]   People bring a certain devotion to their jobs in Japan,
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.700]   whatever they are, and so people are lifelong servers
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:07.500]   or restaurateurs, so you absolutely don't want to tip.
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.140]   - And what about mealtimes?
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:12.020]   Like, I know that in French culture, it's normal.
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.260]   Sit down for lunch, sit there for a few hours,
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.460]   relax, watch the people go by.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.620]   I feel like in Japan, and you're the expert,
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.260]   but you said it's not expensive.
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.900]   Just to be clear, there are also very expensive restaurants.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.260]   Like, you can go to Japan and have a very delicious meal
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.540]   every day for every meal for a month
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.820]   and not spend that much.
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.420]   You could also go to Japan
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.620]   and spend a ridiculous amount of money,
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.980]   but I've had the fortunate pleasure
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.460]   of going to, like, a Michelin-starred sushi place
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.260]   and had dinner in less than an hour.
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.500]   I would say Japan's not a place to linger
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.700]   after you've eaten a meal, in my experience,
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.620]   but I assume you would second that, or?
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.780]   - Yeah, and I would say also, it's again,
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.980]   not to harp on this idea of the social contract,
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:57.500]   but if you're eating at an inexpensive restaurant,
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.140]   if you're going for ramen,
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:03.780]   or if you're going for gyoza or one of those beef bowls,
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.860]   it's sort of like, when you're done, you go.
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.580]   If you have an empty bowl in front of you,
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.500]   you're sort of no longer welcome.
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.740]   Some places will actually give you a time.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.220]   I have definitely been to restaurants where they say,
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:19.300]   you have one hour starting now to eat,
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.940]   and it's not meant to be rude.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.180]   It is part of that,
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.300]   well, we want to provide you the best service,
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.380]   and the person before you took only their hour.
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.540]   So now you are also only going to take your hour.
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.940]   There are venues that are where you go and socialize,
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:38.620]   izakaya, so bars that have bar food.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.380]   It's a lot less structured.
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.780]   You go, a lot of times you don't need to make a reservation.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.700]   They have an empty table.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.740]   You sit down, you drink, you eat a little,
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.180]   you drink, you eat a little,
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.740]   but everything is very segmented.
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.140]   And I would think of dining in Tokyo
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.260]   and in Japan in that manner.
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.300]   Think in the United States,
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.660]   we have a lot of restaurants that are pan-Japanese.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.860]   You can order sushi, you can order udon,
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:01.900]   you can order all these,
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.020]   maybe even Thai food at the same restaurant.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:05.860]   This is the opposite.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:09.140]   Every restaurant in Japan usually has one thing
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.100]   that they do exceptionally well,
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.180]   and they do it maybe 10 ways.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.820]   So you're going to a soba restaurant.
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:20.740]   You're going to a udon restaurant, a tofu restaurant.
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:25.740]   And so everything is much more specialized and specific.
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.260]   - Yep, I found that.
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.100]   If we went through,
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.500]   we could probably go through a long list,
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.700]   but are there some maybe off the beaten path
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.340]   types of food specialties or culinary experiences
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.900]   where it's like, go seek out a place
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.060]   that has great X, Y, or Z?
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.060]   - Yeah, I think a lot of people, like you mentioned,
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:44.780]   are prone to doing a really expensive sushi experience.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.420]   Usually that will be omakase.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.660]   And I think a lot of us have heard the word omakase.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.220]   Really what that means is whatever you want.
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:57.060]   It's actually what you say to the chef at your pleasure.
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:02.060]   And what I would recommend doing before indulging in that
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.700]   is going to a kaiten sushi,
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.780]   going to a really inexpensive rotating sushi restaurant
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.700]   where they'll have like a little conveyor belt
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.860]   and different things are going to come in front of you
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:15.900]   and it's going to be very inexpensive.
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.940]   And take the opportunity to try a few things
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:22.580]   before you go to the higher end restaurant
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.100]   because as things go higher end,
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.540]   it verges into delicacy territory
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:31.540]   where you are going to get a lot of fish sperm
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:36.340]   or raw octopus, things that have textures
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:39.260]   that aren't familiar to the Western palate.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:42.300]   So I would exercise your palate before you go
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.180]   because you don't want to not eat something
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:48.340]   in front of the chef that is cooking right in front of you
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.700]   at his pleasure, quote unquote.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.100]   - That's a great recommendation.
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.540]   Okay, so maybe in the interest of time,
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.580]   are there a few favorite restaurants
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.700]   that you'd recommend people put on a list?
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.140]   I'm sure there's plenty.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.420]   - Gosh, yeah.
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.860]   So ramen's a big question.
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.220]   I get a lot of people wondering,
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.300]   I want to do a ramen meal while I'm there.
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.260]   Well, ramen is everywhere now
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.820]   and we have really good ramen in the United States.
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.940]   So rather than going to the Ippudo Mothership,
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:18.260]   even though we have Ippudo here or the Afuri Mothership,
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.420]   I would recommend trying something a little more offbeat.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.980]   So I love kagari ramen.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:24.940]   It's in Ginza.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.340]   They have two locations.
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.220]   It is a chicken ramen.
[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:31.420]   It's a very creamy chicken broth.
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:33.460]   Describing it does not do it.
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:34.620]   - It's so good.
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.180]   I've been there, it's so good.
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:39.060]   - It's unreal how good it is.
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:40.860]   And why I like that is because
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.020]   you cannot get that anywhere else.
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:46.260]   It is a ramen experience in a ramen place,
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:49.540]   but it is something truly elevated
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:53.620]   that you will have a hard time finding when you return home.
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.540]   - Yeah, the other place I'll throw out is Kikanbo,
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.580]   which is known for spice.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.020]   It's a spicy ramen place.
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:03.660]   You actually pick your ramen on two tiers of spice,
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.100]   both like chili hot spice
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:09.060]   and the kind of Sancho pepper spice,
[00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:11.220]   which is kind of like a Sichuan peppercorn
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.140]   with that like numbing spice.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:16.380]   It's my favorite restaurant in all of Japan.
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.700]   And I'm sure if you don't like spicy food,
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.020]   it would not be your favorite.
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.820]   And this is maybe overhyped,
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.020]   but Sukumen, like dipping ramen,
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:26.580]   which it's popping up at a few places in the States,
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.580]   but it's kind of a different style of eating ramen.
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:32.860]   And Rokuri Nisha in Tokyo Station always has a line,
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:35.540]   but is, I think, fantastic for trying that out,
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.700]   especially if you find yourself at Tokyo Station
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.220]   with some hours to kill.
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:40.580]   - In the idea where I said
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.100]   that picking a chain is counterintuitive,
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.780]   eating at a train station seems counterintuitive as well,
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.660]   but you have to remember
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:50.740]   that there's a massive commuter culture in Tokyo
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:55.580]   and a lot of these small businesses under Tokyo Station
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:59.420]   or in and around it are catering to commuter crowds
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:02.220]   or businessmen at lunch.
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:05.180]   So some of the best quick eats,
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:06.820]   you could build it into your itinerary.
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:08.500]   If you're like, I'm gonna catch the bullet train
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.700]   to Kyoto at one o'clock,
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.940]   go to Tokyo Station at 11.30,
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:16.420]   go get gyoza at Min Min in the basement,
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:17.860]   or try one of the ramen places.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.780]   They even have incredible French pastries.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:23.340]   Pick one of those and then get on your train.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.220]   - Great tip.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.020]   The same, I think, is true about department stores.
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.300]   I feel like the food court
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.420]   in a big department store or shopping center,
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.660]   in the U.S., it's filled with the Panda Express
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:33.780]   and the McDonald's.
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:37.020]   I've had some amazing meals at department store food courts.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.860]   - Department stores is one of those things
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.780]   that, like a toilet, that was brought from the West
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.660]   and then vastly improved
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:46.300]   when it touched down on Japanese soil.
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.260]   And so you're gonna see in the basement
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.660]   of a lot of the department stores,
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:52.460]   they have these huge, huge food courts.
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.100]   It's not what you think of like a mall food court.
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.980]   It is all of these artisanal stalls
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:01.820]   peppered throughout with incredible fare.
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:05.100]   And a lot of that food that you're gonna find down there
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.060]   is both for an elevated lunchtime snack,
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:11.980]   but it also speaks to a culture of omiyage.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.980]   And omiyage is gift giving,
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.420]   something that you're gonna buy for your family
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.460]   when you get home, if you're on a holiday,
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:23.420]   or if you're going to meet someone at their house for dinner.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.580]   We all bring a bottle of wine or something like that,
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:30.580]   but it is in the way that tipping is necessary in America.
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:34.300]   Omiyage is necessary in Japan.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:35.260]   So you're gonna go down there
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.940]   and find these beautifully wrapped cookies.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.660]   It's omiyage to go.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:43.540]   And if you are gonna engage with local individuals,
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.460]   let's say you're gonna take one of these free tours
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.740]   we've been talking about, bring them omiyage.
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:50.260]   Bring people you meet, omiyage.
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:53.820]   Buy key chains from your hometown
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.620]   or maple syrup if you're Canadian,
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:58.740]   or something that you can travel with,
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:01.580]   or go to a department store and buy these omiyage,
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:04.860]   and you'll go much further than other tourists
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.900]   as far as accessing local culture.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:07.740]   - I love that.
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.700]   Any other food tips before we move on?
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.740]   - This is like the optimizer's dilemma
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.420]   is I love Japanese food,
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:16.860]   and it's such a broad category
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.500]   that all I wanna do is eat Japanese food while I'm there.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:23.540]   But man oh man, the best pizza in the world is in Tokyo,
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.180]   and I know that sounds blasphemous,
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:30.180]   but Savoy in Azabu Juban is my favorite pizza place
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.500]   on the planet.
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.340]   It's Neapolitan pies.
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.060]   It is incredible.
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:37.620]   I highly recommend it.
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:41.420]   And I would think about trying other types of food
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:45.260]   while you're there after you've had your Japanese fix
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:48.660]   because they just do it so dang well.
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:51.940]   And one of my favorite restaurants totally under the radar,
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:55.900]   please let's all keep this between ourselves, is Tama.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.660]   It's Okinawan food.
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:00.300]   You're still getting aspects of Japanese culture,
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:03.660]   but you're seeing how it blends with Taiwanese influence.
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:04.580]   If you look at a map,
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:09.580]   Okinawa is much, much closer to Taiwan than it is Japan.
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.980]   So you're gonna see how both cultures inform the cuisine.
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:16.300]   Tama is very close to Shibuya, very small restaurant,
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.860]   super friendly staff, big smiles.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.540]   Just tell them, "Omakase."
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:23.020]   Just tell them, "Just bring me some stuff."
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.380]   - The two other ones I'll leave.
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.820]   There's a punk rock Itsukaya,
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.940]   I'm gonna butcher this name, Tatamichiya.
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.020]   I'll put it in the show notes.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.740]   It's just such a cool spot.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:35.460]   It's good food, good vibes.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.580]   For me, just playing cool music.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.340]   My wife and I almost go every time.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:42.180]   And the other is gonna be a crazy one,
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.980]   but you'll probably hear lots of people tell you,
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:45.540]   "Go to 7-Eleven and just try
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.300]   all these different crazy snacks."
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:51.220]   They have in these little plastic bags, pancakes.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.540]   They have all kinds of flavors,
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:53.500]   filled with red bean, filled with this,
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:56.420]   but they actually have a pancake that's very Americanized,
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:57.940]   which is like filled with maple syrup
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:58.980]   and a little bit of butter.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.980]   And you can put it in the microwave at 7-Eleven
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.260]   and heat it up.
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.820]   And I don't know how,
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:06.860]   but these plastic bag pancakes
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:09.740]   might be the most delicious pancakes on the planet
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:10.580]   at a 7-Eleven.
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.260]   So one, just go to 7-Eleven.
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.340]   There's so many crazy things.
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:15.620]   I've heard the egg salad sandwiches are delicious,
[00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.660]   but not my thing.
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:19.100]   - I could write of love poetry
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:22.540]   to those egg salad sandwich or tamago sando.
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.740]   I was gonna say the convenience store,
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.020]   the konbini culture is really fascinating.
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:28.100]   And to save time,
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.660]   we'll link to an article that I wrote
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.420]   about the 10 things you need to buy at a convenience store.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:34.380]   I fully recommend digging in.
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.660]   - Awesome, that's so great.
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:39.980]   Okay, so everyone can go look at one of the many guidebooks
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:42.140]   you've probably written and see,
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.500]   oh, go to the Imperial Palace,
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.660]   go to the Meiji Shrine, that kind of stuff.
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.100]   What are some of your favorites
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.460]   that maybe aren't on the top 10 list?
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:52.860]   - Well, there are a lot of opportunities to climb a tower
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:56.980]   and see the cityscape from high above.
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:58.740]   Absolutely worth doing.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.380]   Do not pay to do this.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.100]   If there's an opportunity where you need to pay
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:04.100]   to get in an elevator, don't pay.
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.540]   The Tokyo Metropolitan offices in Shinjuku,
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.180]   you can go to the top for free.
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.940]   It is rammed with tourists.
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.580]   My recommendation would be to go to a high-end hotel.
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:16.940]   All of their lobbies are lofted over office buildings,
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:20.660]   and you can get a cocktail in a much more relaxed atmosphere
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:22.060]   and have that city view.
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.060]   The New Four Seasons in Otemachi, I think,
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.660]   has the best view of the Imperial Gardens.
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.780]   And right behind it, on a very clear day,
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:32.100]   usually in winter, you can see Mount Fuji.
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:36.300]   There is no better view amongst the luxury hotels right now.
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.580]   Now, as far as more off-the-beaten-path things,
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:43.540]   you're gonna exit the Yamanote line.
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:46.900]   You're gonna take one of the spokes off of the wheel
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.580]   that are on the suburban rail lines,
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.100]   and you're gonna wanna go to neighborhoods
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:53.660]   like Shimokitazawa.
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:58.660]   You're gonna wanna go to Kichijoji or Daikanyama.
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:02.380]   Another popular one is Nakameguro.
[00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:06.260]   And I even like Geogakka, which is even further.
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.340]   These are more neighborhood-y,
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:12.740]   so a mix of small, traditional houses,
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.340]   and then some newer builds,
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:16.540]   everything really crammed together.
[00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:21.100]   Little stores, boutiques, mom-and-pop shops
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:23.100]   next to more corporate things.
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:26.340]   I know that I just rambled off five different neighborhoods.
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.780]   Write 'em down, give 'em a Google.
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:31.660]   You're gonna find everything that you want in those.
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:34.420]   There's a really good donut shop
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:39.420]   just beyond Shimokitazawa called Haritsu
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:41.940]   that is in what seems like a little tea house,
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:44.140]   but they serve very modern donuts.
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:45.860]   Give that a whirl.
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:48.020]   Promise you won't be disappointed.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:49.220]   - I'll throw one out.
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.180]   They're always changing,
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:52.500]   but there's a company called TeamLab
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:56.300]   that does these really interesting, immersive experiences.
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.820]   The ones we did, Borderless,
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.460]   and one other one I can't remember, maybe Planets.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.060]   I don't know which ones are running now.
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.180]   It seems that there's always one in Tokyo.
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.780]   Highly recommended.
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.620]   Kind of wild, interesting, immersive art
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:11.660]   with lights and maybe sounds, maybe textures.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:12.500]   They're always changing,
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:15.020]   but those were so awesome that we went to one,
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.580]   and the next day we were like, "We have to go to the other."
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:19.460]   - I'm a huge fan.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:22.380]   I went to one right before the pandemic
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.220]   and did it twice in that day.
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:25.060]   I was like, "I need to have
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.940]   the whole adventure all over again."
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:31.620]   It's very sensory, a lot of textures playing with light.
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:32.780]   There's water.
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:33.980]   You do want to dress appropriately
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:35.980]   for the one that you have to walk through water,
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:38.420]   and with pants that you can easily pull up.
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.020]   Highly recommend that as well.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.060]   That's out in Odaiba.
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:43.980]   Odaiba was created in Tokyo Bay
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:47.620]   using garbage to build man-made islands.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:48.860]   Even though it's an indoor thing,
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.180]   you actually should plan that on a very nice day,
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.260]   because once you're out there,
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:53.660]   it's really nice to walk around
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:56.780]   and take in the city from out there.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:59.020]   It's sort of this pleasure island,
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:01.180]   sort of Vegas-esque destination
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:03.020]   with a lot of really cool outdoor stuff.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:04.380]   - And while we're that direction,
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.500]   do you have a strong opinion
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:08.060]   on whether people should be going to,
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.580]   I'm gonna butcher it again, the fish market.
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:11.620]   Let's just leave it at-
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:12.740]   - Tsukiji. - Tsukiji.
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.780]   - Well, so it's no longer in Tsukiji.
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:17.300]   - If I remember right, it's still that direction, right?
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:18.140]   - Yes, it is. - Okay, okay.
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:19.620]   - So it's further out.
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:24.540]   So Tsukiji was, is the biggest fish market in the world,
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:27.140]   and then it moved to a bigger location in Toyosu,
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:31.180]   and in the remains of Tsukiji
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:35.900]   are still a lot of little fresh fish,
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:39.660]   sashimi, sushi restaurants and bars.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:43.100]   As far as wanting to do the fish auction
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.020]   and different things like that,
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.060]   that's something that you need
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:48.300]   to talk to a private guide about.
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.020]   They all have different kinds of access,
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.780]   and they all have different opinions on it,
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.660]   how you wanna leverage your jet lag
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:56.940]   to get up in the middle of the night to go see it.
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:00.660]   But I think Tsukiji is really close to Ginza.
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:03.260]   It's walkable to Ginza if you wanna go check it out
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:07.220]   and try that intro sushi that we were talking about before.
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.740]   There's a chain of sushi called Sushi Zanmai,
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.300]   and they're really famous in Japan
[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:15.280]   because the owner is this Colonel Sanders character,
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:19.780]   come to life, who always famously makes the biggest bid
[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:20.780]   at the fish auction.
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:23.580]   He always buys the most expensive fish of the year.
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:27.020]   And there's a lot of locations all over Tokyo,
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:30.420]   and that's a really good place to do your sort of intro
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:33.500]   to more adventurous sushi and sashimi.
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.060]   - A couple others for me,
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:38.420]   the Design Sites 2121 Museum I thought was really cool.
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.980]   Obviously, it's a museum, so exhibits change.
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:43.500]   And I'm dying to get your take
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.300]   on recommending Robot Restaurant.
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.740]   - Well, there's a lot of different themed restaurants
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.620]   all over Japan and Tokyo.
[00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:54.380]   Once, as a kind of wink, I went to the Ninja restaurant
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.220]   for my birthday one year.
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:57.740]   It was super fun and cheesy.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:00.020]   And of course, you know what you're signing up for.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:05.020]   I shy away from the "Japan is weird" trip.
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:11.180]   I don't think that you're getting a lot of true insight.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:14.620]   I think it would be sort of akin to going
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:19.540]   to like a baseball-themed restaurant in America
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:23.580]   or something that is taking a piece of Americana
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.980]   and hyperbolizing it.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:28.500]   And it's all just for show and for giggles.
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.860]   That's not really my vibe.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:35.540]   You could design an entire itinerary of "Japan is weird."
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.540]   In the Akihabara neighborhood,
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:40.220]   there are these things called maid cafes
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:42.220]   where all the cafes have a different theme,
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:45.860]   and you go and your server takes on a role.
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.420]   So there's one where you get to play the older brother
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:50.540]   and she plays the younger sister.
[00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:52.340]   There's one where you get to be the prince
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:54.020]   and she's the princess.
[00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.820]   That is sort of culturally curious.
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.500]   Might be a little bit hard to access
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.020]   if you don't have Japanese.
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:03.820]   But I don't love doing something
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:07.100]   for the sake of zoo-ifying culture.
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:10.100]   - Almost every memorable experience I have
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:14.020]   skews on the authentic side of eating at a small place
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:17.180]   with amazing food or going to see something interesting.
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.100]   So I don't disagree.
[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:22.220]   - That's my soapbox moment for the episode.
[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:25.500]   - Maybe one more is if your stay in Tokyo
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:29.540]   aligns with one of the sumo times of year
[00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:31.780]   that sumo wrestling happens in Tokyo,
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.260]   I think that's an interesting experience,
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.980]   but it's a very specific time.
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:38.020]   It's not like baseball where there's a game every week.
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:39.100]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:41.460]   That is sort of in the eastern part of the city,
[00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:44.580]   sort of beyond the two o'clock, three o'clock,
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:46.700]   if we're talking about the clock map.
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:48.300]   Ryogoku, that area.
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.020]   Again, this is something that you wanna enable
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.740]   with a private guide.
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:54.460]   I don't think you wanna do the zoo aspect.
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:56.700]   I think that there are ways to engage
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:59.420]   in a more culturally curious manner.
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:02.740]   I would honestly avoid the Skytree,
[00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:05.700]   which is also sort of out in that part of town.
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:09.900]   It was built to economically stimulate that area of town,
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:13.220]   which is a bit older and not as modernized.
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:14.980]   It's just a big tower in the sky
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:16.500]   with a bunch of shops around it.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:21.020]   It's pretty far from where you're gonna be staying likely,
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.820]   because I would recommend trying to stay
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:27.460]   a little bit closer to the sort of six to nine o'clock
[00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:28.540]   part of the clock.
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:30.100]   It's just not worth the schlep.
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:32.860]   - Let's do some quick hits on drinks,
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:34.820]   whether it's nightlife or coffee.
[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:37.660]   I'll do mine first to try to keep the speed going.
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:40.780]   There's a really cool coffee shop called Deus Ex Machina,
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.820]   which is like, can't remember the neighborhoods,
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:43.660]   but you can Google it.
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:44.700]   I'll put it in the show notes,
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:48.620]   which is one of our favorite coffee shops in Tokyo.
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:51.820]   And then for drinks and stuff, my favorite bars,
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:52.860]   I'm just gonna list them,
[00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:56.580]   are Bar Trench, Bar Tram, and Bar Benfidich.
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:58.420]   - Benfidich. - Yeah.
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:00.980]   Again, the coffee, tea, nightlife areas.
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:02.740]   - We'd go to Nakameguro,
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:04.740]   which is like a very cool neighborhood.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:08.380]   That's where they have a massive multi-story
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:12.900]   Starbucks reserve that you walk by (laughs)
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.460]   and kind of ogle at the fact
[00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:18.420]   that there's a 90-minute wait to get in.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.660]   And then you go up the street
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:22.740]   to a place called Breakfast Club,
[00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:27.020]   which is this Japanese version of an American diner
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:32.020]   run by these two cool kind of DJ guys
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:36.460]   who just have this really cool
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:41.060]   breakfast-all-day-everyday vibe with diner coffee.
[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:43.700]   And it's just so much fun.
[00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:45.020]   I love going there.
[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:46.580]   Great music.
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:50.180]   Kind of breakfast-meets-bar.
[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:53.020]   As far as coffee goes,
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:56.060]   I made the mistake of putting it in The Lonely Planet
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.980]   about 12 years ago when I was working on the Japan Guide.
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:03.020]   But in Shimokitazawa, you want to go to Bear Pond.
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:04.260]   A little hole in the wall.
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:05.660]   Massively popular.
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:08.140]   Do not try to take a photo.
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:09.460]   They will be mad at you.
[00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:11.820]   But excellent espresso.
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:12.980]   Any thoughts on nightlife?
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.140]   I feel like I'm past my nightlife prime,
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.820]   other than getting some good cocktails.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.820]   But anything you want to add to that category?
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:21.460]   Back in the day when I was a student,
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:23.620]   the metro stops at around one
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:25.020]   and then starts back up at five.
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:29.380]   At 12.50, you're like, "Okay, guys, are we going home
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:31.060]   "or are we going out all night
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:32.580]   "and getting on the five o'clock train?"
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:34.180]   And usually it meant going out all night
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:35.580]   and getting on the five o'clock train.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:37.940]   Back then, like 20 years ago,
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:40.060]   it was Shibuya and Roppongi
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:42.140]   were like the big club places.
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:44.180]   And that's kind of changed and evolved.
[00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:47.620]   Shibuya has had, there's sort of like a love hotel
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:49.740]   kind of seedy side to the back of Shibuya
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:51.940]   that is evolving right now
[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:54.260]   and it's becoming a much more commercial
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:55.340]   and wholesome destination.
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:59.140]   There are a lot of new high-end hotels that are going in.
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.300]   If you want to give something an interesting try,
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:06.300]   I would try like a multi-course cocktail.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.340]   If you're really into cocktails,
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:13.660]   I'm very happy with highball or like a whiskey on the rocks.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.780]   If you're a cocktail person,
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:19.700]   there are a handful of different cocktail restaurants
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:23.420]   where you're doing like four cocktails over a couple hours
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.620]   and each one is very different
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.900]   and they're paced as though you're having a meal.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:30.380]   Just like we talked about pizza and coffee and everything,
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:32.540]   taking cocktails to the next level,
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:34.340]   there are some of the best cocktail bars
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.340]   and cocktails in the world in Japan.
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.420]   I feel like you could pick anything and just say that
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:39.540]   and it would probably be true,
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:42.020]   but I have a lot of personal experience
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:44.700]   on the cocktail front to say that it is true.
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:47.420]   There is this through theme also of intentionality.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:50.780]   Every business owner brings this incredible intentionality
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.700]   to their products.
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:55.740]   Like Ben Fittich is incredible in that way
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:00.740]   where the bartender is making everything involved.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.100]   I've been to restaurants
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:06.380]   where the chef is even making the silverware
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:07.300]   that you're using.
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.340]   So this incredible intentionality
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:12.700]   just permeates food and beverage.
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:15.140]   And if you are a cocktail nerd, a mixology nerd,
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.180]   you're really not gonna find
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.180]   any other better cocktails on the planet.
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.060]   - Yeah, I completely agree.
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.260]   I have two questions.
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.340]   One, I don't know the answer to.
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.660]   I didn't have kids when I went,
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:25.340]   so you've written guidebooks,
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.180]   so I'm sure you've had to think about this.
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:29.180]   What's the vibe like with bringing kids,
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.700]   bringing them to restaurants, that kind of stuff?
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:32.820]   - That's a really good question,
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.220]   especially because it's a country
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.780]   that we always see in the news
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.140]   that is shrinking in population.
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:42.020]   So there are not a lot of kids out and about.
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.060]   And also, how do you bring a kid who's very young
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.860]   and how do you control their behavior
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.580]   to abide by the social contract
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:53.540]   of being a good guest in different places?
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.140]   Well, I mean, not everyone is expecting
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:56.860]   your three-year-old child to be perfect.
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:00.860]   Do you take that person to a $300 omakase?
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:02.740]   No, because you're not bringing that person
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:05.740]   to that $300 omakase at home either.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:07.660]   I have seen, because of the pandemic,
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:10.380]   maybe a lot more green spaces opening up.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:12.340]   There's like a beautiful walk that you can do
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:15.380]   in Shimokitazawa now that they buried the track
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:17.940]   between three stations.
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:21.940]   And now that has been turned into really cool walking paths
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:23.780]   and gardens and shops.
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:27.900]   I would try to keep kids sort of more in those areas.
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:31.980]   And there's a lot of dining in that manner
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:34.260]   where you can eat out on a patio
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:36.780]   and then it's like a little bit less intense
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:38.060]   to have your kids.
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:41.340]   I will say from all of my experiences in Japan,
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:44.140]   it's like lots of walking, moving around,
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:45.260]   eating four meals a day.
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:47.980]   Like, it would have been hard to do the kind of experiences
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:49.020]   I've done with kids.
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:50.780]   I'm sure there's a different itinerary
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.540]   for a family-friendly trip,
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:54.660]   but I think for us, we're just like,
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.060]   maybe we're just gonna wait a few years
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:57.460]   till the kids are a little older.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.340]   I'm not saying it's impossible.
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:02.420]   I know the kind of Japan trip we love having,
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:04.460]   and I feel like we might not get it
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:07.380]   if we go with infants and toddlers.
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:09.820]   - I agree, and I don't wanna discourage families
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:11.460]   from booking a family trip to Japan,
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.860]   but I would say that the trip that you think
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:16.660]   you want to have will be difficult to execute
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:17.820]   with a toddler.
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:20.580]   - Yeah, especially if that is cocktails
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.100]   and lots of street food.
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:25.260]   Is there any last thing in Tokyo that we didn't mention
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.580]   or you're like, I gotta share this?
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:27.820]   Even if it's such a secret
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:30.420]   that we keep it out of the show notes.
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:34.780]   - Well, I do have one ultra-favorite restaurant.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:38.140]   I've probably celebrated about 10 birthdays in Japan,
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:41.780]   maybe 15, and many of them have happened at that restaurant,
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.540]   but you're gonna have to DM me on Instagram
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:44.380]   for the name of it.
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:45.820]   Sorry. - Ooh, I like it.
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:46.660]   I like it.
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.380]   Okay. - It's a yakitori restaurant,
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:51.220]   so it's chicken and vegetables, rather, on skewers.
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:54.820]   Small place, great vibe, incredible drinks.
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:56.260]   - I was gonna call this your best guest secret,
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.380]   and you're literally gonna keep it
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:58.780]   a little bit of a secret for the episode,
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:01.380]   but we'll link to your Instagram in the show notes.
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.460]   It's just brandpress.
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:03.300]   I appreciate that.
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:04.820]   I'm gonna send you a DM right after this.
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.660]   Okay, we gotta move on to Kyoto.
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:08.620]   There is an infinite amount of things
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.740]   that we could keep talking about in Tokyo.
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:15.260]   Our next partner has a product I literally use every day.
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.740]   I started taking AG1 from Athletic Greens
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:19.260]   because I wanted an easy way
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:21.180]   to get my daily nutritional insurance
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:23.140]   and optimize my immune system,
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:25.640]   and it's been in my routine for almost a year,
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.940]   because when you take one scoop of AG1,
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:30.460]   you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.780]   minerals, whole food source superfoods,
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:36.100]   probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.620]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.780]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:43.820]   and head to my office feeling focused
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:45.340]   and energized for the day,
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.860]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:50.620]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:54.300]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.080]   To make giving it a try easy,
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:59.160]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.040]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:04.520]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:09.400]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:14.040]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.680]   to take ownership over your health
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.640]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.200]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to

[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.120]   To go back to what you said earlier,
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.900]   I feel like every time we go to Japan,
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:43.380]   there are some countries where you'd come for your next trip
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:45.060]   and you'd skip the main city
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:45.940]   'cause you've been there before.
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.740]   Every time we're like, let's go back to Tokyo,
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:49.540]   there's so much more to uncover.
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.560]   But we've gotta move on.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.140]   You said there's two places that everyone
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.700]   should consider going, it's Tokyo and Kyoto.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:59.020]   How do you think about Kyoto being organized
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.820]   to the extent that's helpful?
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.260]   Okay, so the first mistake that people make
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.340]   when they're doing a trip to Japan
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.340]   and they do Tokyo and Kyoto is they think
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:10.220]   Tokyo, new, Kyoto, old.
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:11.060]   Big mistake.
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.540]   You're missing so many cool things in Tokyo
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:15.100]   by only focusing on the new.
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:18.580]   And you're missing so much of the essence of Kyoto
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:20.180]   by only focusing on the old.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:23.280]   And that's places of worship and castles
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.160]   and stuff like that.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.600]   The other mistake that people make with Kyoto
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:30.160]   is that because they have old in their brain,
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:33.080]   they wanna stay at a traditional inn.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.920]   And part of staying at a ryokan
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.080]   is that you're gonna be served dinner
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.000]   and you're gonna be served breakfast
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.680]   and it's all about fostering relaxation.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:46.140]   It really seems antithetical to the time
[01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:48.000]   that you're gonna spend in the city,
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.520]   which is gonna be just as excited
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.800]   about getting around and seeing all the temples
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.920]   and seeing all the cafes and experiencing the culture.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.880]   So I would leave that traditional inn,
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:02.960]   that ryokan experience for the countryside
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:06.940]   and not marry it to your Kyoto experience.
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:11.720]   Now, happy to indulge in all the oldness that is Kyoto.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.560]   It is the ancient capital.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.240]   It is an incredible city
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.320]   with some of the oldest cultural relics
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.400]   that remain intact in the world.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.600]   But at its core, it's also a place of learning.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.560]   It's a college town.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.680]   It's much smaller than Tokyo
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:30.860]   and there's a thriving student culture there
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:32.600]   that is well worth tapping into.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.400]   And that's tea shops, cafes,
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:39.380]   really cool clothing stores and boutiques,
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:43.640]   getting into handicrafts and these old family businesses.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:47.360]   You should absolutely pick a handful of temples
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:50.160]   that you wanna see and appreciate that culture.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.020]   But a lot of people treat those temples
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:53.920]   the way that people in Europe treat a church.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.760]   They go and they're just like,
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:57.980]   "Wow, opulence, the cathedral, super cool,"
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:01.920]   without delving too much into the history aspect of it all.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:04.000]   And it's okay if you're allergic to,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.520]   "Oh, this temple was made in 1636," or da-da-da-da.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.960]   That's fine, I'm kind of allergic to that as well.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.200]   But just make sure to bear in mind
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:16.200]   to have a broader experience in Kyoto than you might expect.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.400]   You're gonna see a lot of people walking around
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.940]   in traditional attire.
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:23.640]   A lot of people come back from trips to Japan
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.880]   and they say, "Oh my God, I saw a geisha in Kyoto."
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.160]   You did not see a geisha.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.320]   You saw a Taiwanese traveler
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:34.380]   who rented her kimono for the day and they dress you up.
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.040]   This is a really popular thing
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:40.600]   for Korean, Singaporean, Taiwanese travelers to do.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.400]   The geisha culture that you hear about
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.580]   from members of a geisha in Gion,
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:46.140]   one of the geisha districts,
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.040]   is much more behind closed doors.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.880]   - And is that something that there's a way
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.720]   to learn, appreciate, and experience and understand it?
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.580]   Or is it one of the few things
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:57.960]   that is hard for Westerners to be a part of?
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.600]   - This is something that you're gonna have to plan
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.440]   while in advance.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.800]   This is something that a lot of people
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.480]   have gained access to over years of building relationships.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:09.520]   And there are pricey, personalized,
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:12.360]   luxury experiences where you can go spend time
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:14.680]   with a maiko, like a geisha in training,
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:19.200]   or a geisha and have a really mind-expanding experience
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.760]   about what that culture looks like.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.160]   I mean, it is on the decline.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.760]   It's not what it was a long time ago.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.720]   This is something, a bit of former glory,
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:30.020]   but it is still there for you to consume.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.340]   But the best way to do it would be
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.700]   to pick a luxury travel planner
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:36.120]   and book that experience through them
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.280]   as a one-on-one experience.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.160]   - And this is something that we didn't mention earlier
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.480]   when we talked about restaurants,
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:44.400]   but I find that unlike many places in the world
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.840]   where it's just pop up, open table,
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.160]   make your reservation, search online for, book a tour,
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.120]   there are still a ton of restaurants and experiences
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.480]   that if you don't have a travel planner
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.760]   or a higher-end hotel concierge, you just can't do.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.320]   Is that the experience you've seen,
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.720]   or is there another way to access
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:03.600]   some of these restaurants or experiences?
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.040]   - That's pretty much right.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.880]   And as someone who cut their teeth
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.760]   writing guidebooks for Lonely Planet,
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:12.700]   I am all about trying to enable as many opportunities
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:16.720]   for travelers and readers on their own that I can,
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.980]   but a lot of these things are guarded.
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:22.000]   So you will need a luxury travel planner
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.280]   who has made 20 or 30 years of inroads in the destination,
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.120]   who forged that relationship with the Geisha house
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.680]   to make that happen.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.040]   So if that is something that's a priority to you
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.960]   and you wanna have the real experience,
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.840]   you are going to pay for it.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:38.880]   - I'll caution people.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:43.160]   One option is if you do wanna have one of those experiences,
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:45.520]   either book through a luxury travel provider
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.520]   or at a higher-end hotel,
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.120]   you don't have to do it the whole time.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.480]   So I tell people, there are some restaurants
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.200]   that are very difficult to get a reservation at
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:56.060]   without a high-end travel organizer or concierge or hotel,
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:59.580]   but you could book one or two nights at that hotel.
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:00.420]   I was gonna say at the end,
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:01.760]   we may be talking a bonus episode
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.620]   about how to do that with points,
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:05.880]   and then line up some of those things
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.640]   that you need support from,
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.240]   and then you could move to another hotel
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.680]   that's not as expensive if you don't.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.600]   Keep all that in mind.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.040]   There are an unlimited number
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.040]   of great restaurants experiences you can have without that,
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.080]   but for anyone listening who's trying to have
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.640]   one of those kind of coveted
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.680]   or higher-end exclusive experiences
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.200]   or dining at three Michelin star restaurant,
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.080]   it's not as simple as just going online and booking.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.960]   - Yeah, I should say on background too,
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.720]   I was in Japan right as everything was shutting down in 2020
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.080]   and the reason that I was there
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.160]   is I was doing a very intense audit
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:42.260]   of all of the hotels in Tokyo for Conde Nast Traveler,
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:43.960]   all the ones that were opening up
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.680]   in anticipation of the Olympics.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.680]   Of course, that was completely curtailed
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.220]   and my editor was like, "Get home, get home.
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:53.040]   "They're closing the borders."
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.760]   So when it reopened, I went back to complete that audit.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.800]   So I stayed at dozens of hotels in Tokyo
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.360]   and my editor, when I got home,
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.900]   she was like, "Okay, Brandon, what did you see
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.840]   "that was different than before the pandemic?"
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.140]   And I said, "Well, you know what?
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:12.080]   "It's that all of these hotels now wanna be
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:16.040]   "the purveyor of your experience."
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.080]   Because in all of this time,
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:21.040]   hotels, they were really hurt during the pandemic,
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.600]   so they're trying to find different ways
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.400]   to bring in more revenue.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:28.120]   So a lot of hotels were doing really compelling F&B,
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.540]   food and beverage, bringing in locals to eat
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:34.800]   at the restaurants in case the tourism dwindles again
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.300]   for some unknown reason.
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:37.640]   The other thing that's happening
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:41.960]   is hotels are offering tours.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.140]   And I'm not talking about the group tour thing
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:47.480]   where a bunch of you are going around with a flag.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.240]   Hotels like Aman in Tokyo have a secret concierge service
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:55.360]   where they will take you to local artisans
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:58.580]   to have personalized experience
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:02.160]   where they will cut you kimono and yukata robes,
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.520]   or they will hand etch chopsticks for you,
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.600]   or you can do fan design.
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.720]   These are all exclusive opportunities that Aman offers.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.800]   All of the hotels are getting into this.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.800]   So even if you kind of cringe at the idea
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.280]   of having a travel planner, one of those travel services,
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:22.500]   squeeze out a little bit more from your concierge
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:25.280]   at these high-end hotels because they want to give you
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.440]   more than just a room.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:30.700]   And I would say the Aman is probably at the top of the mark,
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:32.780]   but we've stayed at the Hilton,
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:35.080]   which is not near Aman prices,
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:38.780]   but at a lot of the very big established hotels
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:41.780]   at that level, there are still incredible concierges.
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:44.340]   The Hilton concierge was able to help
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:46.980]   with a number of reservations and activities
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:49.940]   that would have been much harder for me to do myself.
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:51.700]   Obviously, some of the more exclusive things
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:53.500]   might be catered or offered
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.380]   at the higher-end hotels like the Aman,
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:59.200]   but I had a ton of success at even just the Hilton Tokyo.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.040]   - Totally.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.560]   So back in Kyoto, one of the things,
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.280]   like sort of I mentioned in Tokyo,
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.740]   my first day I like to do a triangle
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.760]   to connect three little areas.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.240]   For Kyoto, my thing that I always do when I go
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.080]   is I rent a bicycle.
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.680]   And I usually cheat and rent one of those electric ones
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.200]   that helps you along the way.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.460]   Kyoto's very hilly.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:22.160]   It's sort of hemmed between two mountains in a way.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:25.600]   It's very different than Tokyo
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.800]   in that it's very low-lying.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.880]   A lot of Japanese people say it's very European.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.640]   There's a river that flows through it,
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.000]   but because traffic is much less
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.600]   and everything moves a little slower,
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:41.680]   it's really easy to get around on a bicycle.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.080]   Just remember that you're on the left side of the road.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.800]   And it's a great way to explore
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:51.200]   because it's such a small city relative to Tokyo.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:56.040]   It's really hard to get lost.
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.480]   You can go up and down different streets.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.960]   You can pop in and out of different neighborhoods.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:05.400]   And you're never gonna be woefully far from your hotel.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.780]   - When my wife and I went over 15 years ago
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.440]   to Japan for the first time,
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:10.920]   the first thing we did was we rented a bike
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:11.920]   from the train station.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.200]   We just set our bags.
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:16.120]   I don't remember a lot of how the logistics of that happened,
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.520]   but I do remember we rented the bike
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.080]   right at the train station and went and explored.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.680]   And I think we came back and got our luggage
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:22.840]   'cause we had a late check-in.
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:23.840]   So I love that.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.960]   I'm sure in the lonely planet for Kyoto,
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.440]   there's top 21 experiences that you should have.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.320]   Let's skip those and maybe share some of your favorite things
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.960]   that people should do or see or eat or anything.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.280]   - One of the things that I guarantee
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.800]   is not in any of the guidebooks yet
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:44.840]   is the Park Hyatt Kyoto just opened.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.920]   And so Park Hyatt Tokyo is the super famous
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.760]   Lost in Translation Hotel in Shinjuku,
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.920]   has the New York bar, always rammed with people.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:57.120]   Park Hyatt Kyoto is very close to Kiyomizu-dera,
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:00.640]   which is one of the most famous places of worship.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.760]   Absolutely a must, kind of a worth the hype temple,
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:07.440]   but it's right in the heart of the action.
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.440]   And it's accessible to everyone
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.360]   because they have a bar totally different
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.400]   than the one in Tokyo,
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:17.560]   but this bar overlooks the city.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:21.440]   The one very famous pagoda.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.400]   And I couldn't hold a conversation when I was there
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.000]   because I was so mesmerized by the view.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.960]   It is just one of those cost you the price of a cocktail.
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:37.320]   It costs $18 price of a cocktail
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:41.400]   to have this incredible view.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.840]   And because it's so new, no one's talking about it yet.
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:48.680]   So it's a very small bar with a very few amount of seats,
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:52.840]   but if you're going really soon, absolutely go and do this.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.840]   The hotel is extremely expensive
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:58.160]   and is only for a certain type of traveler,
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.360]   but this is something that I feel
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:02.040]   is pretty accessible to everyone
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:04.960]   and absolutely worth doing at sunset.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.720]   In the wintertime, that sunset is oddly early.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:11.840]   So if you're okay having a drink at 4.45 p.m.,
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.320]   absolutely go for it.
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.720]   This was like my one revelation of Kyoto
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.040]   on this particular trip a few weeks ago.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.080]   Did my screen share just pop up?
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:21.920]   You did.
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.480]   Just shared a photo of having that cocktail at that bar
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.480]   with that pagoda in the background.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:30.040]   We stayed at the Park Hyatt in Kyoto
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.480]   and you say very expensive,
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.040]   but I will say Chase transfers to Park Hyatt on points
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.600]   is maybe one of the best deals in the world.
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.080]   So it is actually accessible
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.080]   if you can find the availability.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.200]   The hotel was amazing.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:44.760]   I will say we stayed there like weeks after it opened
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:47.240]   and it was very rough around the edges.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.880]   I have no doubt that the Park Hyatt
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.840]   has cleaned up those rough edges,
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:54.080]   but we had some frustrating experiences
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.400]   for a hotel of that level.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.880]   But wow, the bar was amazing.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.400]   We couldn't even get into the restaurant at the hotel,
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.840]   which is next to the bar and had an awesome view.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.800]   So I can't speak to it
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.720]   because even though we stayed there four nights,
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:08.040]   they were like, "Oh, sorry, we don't have any tables."
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.320]   It was such a strange thing
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.320]   to not be able to eat at the hotel restaurant
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.440]   on a few days notice,
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.200]   but wholeheartedly recommend the hotel.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:19.440]   It's so beautiful and very inaccessible with dollars,
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.320]   but accessible with points.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.680]   Hyatt's great for that.
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:27.120]   A lot of people level up to the Grand Hyatt in Tokyo,
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.760]   which is cheaper than the Park Hyatt brand.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.320]   It's sort of one level down.
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:34.040]   That hotel, decor wise, it's long in the tooth.
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.200]   The location is great.
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:38.400]   You're really right in the middle of town
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.800]   and it's a little splurge
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.600]   if you're more of a budget traveler
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.920]   and you have those points, go for the Grand.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:48.480]   - So I'll share a couple things from Kyoto from our trip
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:51.880]   that are just kind of quick hits that I really enjoyed.
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.520]   So bar rocking chair.
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.760]   I went one night with my brother-in-law
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.600]   and we were like, "Do we even have to leave?"
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.440]   Like, "Should we just stay here, keep coming back?"
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:02.280]   - I love that place.
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.720]   - It's such a cool bar.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.000]   It was also very funny
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.600]   because my brother-in-law is like six, five.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.080]   He barely fit in part of that bar.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:13.120]   There's a tea shop called Yugen,
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:16.640]   which serves matcha and it was just wonderful.
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.560]   I say this about so many parts of Japan,
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:21.440]   but a very beautifully designed matcha shop
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.800]   that I really loved.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.720]   And then I already mentioned the pizza shop at the beginning
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:27.560]   and Coco Raya was just an itsukaya
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.720]   that we went to and had a great time.
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.440]   I'm not gonna say it's the best itsukaya in the world,
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:33.920]   but if you're looking for one, we had a great time there.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:38.000]   I'm gonna add a tea destination as well, Ippodo.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.760]   So not Ippudo, like the ramen, but Ippodo.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:43.160]   They're really close to the Ritz-Carlton
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:46.760]   and they do tea tasting.
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:50.320]   So think of it exactly in like a wine tasting kind of way.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.280]   You can sign up to do a tea tasting.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.440]   The taste is incredible.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.440]   The packaging is so beautiful.
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.640]   This is a good omiyage
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.920]   for someone that you really like back at home
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:03.280]   or someone that you're meeting in Japan.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.280]   Has a very storied reputation in the country.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.760]   One of the places that I wanna recommend is Monk.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:13.440]   It's a restaurant that my editor at Bloomberg,
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.840]   she was in Japan with her husband a few years ago
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:19.360]   and she ate there and I was in Tokyo at the time
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.240]   and she called me and she was like,
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.080]   "Get your butt down to Kyoto.
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:24.160]   "You need to go to this restaurant
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.560]   "and you need to write about it."
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:29.720]   Basically what it is takes the sort of multi-course
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:32.840]   kaiseki idea in Japanese cuisine,
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:35.840]   but it flips it Italian style.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.200]   And instead of having a hearty rice dish,
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.880]   which usually punctuates the end of a kaiseki meal,
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.800]   it's a pizza.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:45.400]   And I really like, let's not obsess about pizza in Japan.
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.240]   People are gonna think we're weird.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:50.800]   But it's run by Chef Imai
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:55.800]   and he brings this monastic discipline to his food.
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.640]   And I believe after our story ran,
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:03.160]   it found its way to a Netflix Chef's Table episode.
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:06.360]   It's well worth checking out
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.760]   and also give yourself a little bit of time
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:10.240]   to walk around that part of town.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.640]   It's a little more residential.
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.680]   It's a little more out of the way.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.920]   You're not gonna see other tourists over there.
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:15.960]   It's beautiful.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:19.520]   There's a beautiful path that goes through the nature
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:20.600]   of that neighborhood too.
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:23.760]   So kind of bundle that experience together.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.560]   - Any specific types of food that you're in Kyoto,
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:30.160]   Kyoto's the place to try X or Y?
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.200]   - Man, that's a good question.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.320]   I did wanna give one suggestion
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.880]   that is along those lines, but a little unexpected.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.960]   It's gin.
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:41.120]   There's a gin tasting room called Kinobi.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.680]   Kinobi kind of came out the gate,
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:46.360]   I wanna say about five, six years ago now.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.360]   And as someone who writes
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:50.240]   about a lot of different destinations all over the world,
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:53.800]   I am constantly being pitched a local gin, constantly.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:57.520]   People are making gin out of sawdust at this point.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:01.120]   And I was fascinated by Kinobi.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:05.240]   They're using a lot of the local botanicals.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:10.240]   There's like Kyoyasai, basically the local Kyoto harvest,
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:13.040]   which really informs this gin.
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:15.880]   And I'm admittedly not a big gin person.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.440]   I'm more of a brown spirits person.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:19.600]   This is absolutely my favorite.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.400]   And in the quiet of the pandemic,
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.720]   they opened a tasting room
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.440]   and it is well worth going to try.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.520]   And speaking of Kyoyasai and this local harvest,
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.440]   this is really what the area is all about.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:34.360]   And one of the best restaurants
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.680]   that it's not gonna break the budget,
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:40.800]   it's called Yasai Hori, Hori is the name of the chef.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.800]   There's a lot of indoor shopping arcades in Kyoto,
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:46.880]   and it's off of one of those, really inconspicuous.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:51.400]   It has two tables and like eight bar tops.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:54.440]   The only staff member is chef.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:57.040]   And he's gonna do really honest food.
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:01.080]   I think a lot of American food is overly sauced.
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.480]   This is the antidote.
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:06.440]   This is mushrooms on an open fire.
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:10.320]   This is avocado and red onion.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.120]   This is very simple cuisine
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:17.640]   that the ingredients are just screaming flavor at you.
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:19.560]   - This is not a good thing to be talking about
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:20.400]   right before lunch.
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.000]   I'm like, do I eat here or just go to SFO
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.440]   and take a trip to Japan?
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.400]   (laughing)
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.120]   It seems like we bring up a lot of food and drinking,
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.360]   but are there other things to spend the time
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:32.160]   in between eating or drinking in Kyoto,
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.440]   other than a few of the shrines
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.000]   that you think are worth highlighting?
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.920]   - You're not gonna find that Brooklyn-esque quality
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.080]   that you do in Tokyo with certain neighborhoods
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.720]   that are just so effortlessly cool,
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:49.160]   but it's well worth picking a couple neighborhoods
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:52.680]   in Kyoto as well and just doing the back alley walks.
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:54.880]   You're just gonna see a lot of businesses
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:58.360]   that have been around for 300 or 400 years,
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.920]   places that sell very specific things,
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:03.320]   like 11 types of scissors.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:05.080]   There was a shop that I went to
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.680]   that sold needles for sewing
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:12.200]   that had little sculptures on the tip, on the eye,
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:14.580]   like a little frog that you had to look at
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:16.640]   through a magnifying glass.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:18.280]   Little specific shops like this,
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.600]   and that you're only gonna find
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:23.000]   by doing a back alley walk in neighborhoods
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.120]   like Gion, in Sanjo, different places like that.
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.240]   - And culturally, is it okay if you see a little shop,
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.800]   even if you're not gonna buy a needle or a pair of scissors,
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.480]   to walk in and look around, is that okay?
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:34.320]   - Absolutely.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.760]   You can go into any shop that's open,
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.280]   thank them for their time,
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:40.720]   express interest in what they're doing.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.920]   A lot of people are really proud
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.040]   of the things that they're doing.
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.600]   I was in a small town on Lake Biwa on my last trip,
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.280]   about an hour outside of Kyoto, called Hikone,
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:54.560]   and went for udon, and at the end of the meal,
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.680]   the man who ran the udon shop, his wife,
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:59.680]   was making origami, and when the bill was paid,
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.280]   she handed me an origami crane,
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.360]   and she was like, "Here, I made this."
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.800]   And she was just so proud of it, and I kept it.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:09.560]   It's in my office now, and you just find great pride
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:13.260]   in what everyone's doing, so engage with those people.
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:16.680]   Usually the people that are in the shop, it's their stuff.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:18.200]   - I will say, this translates
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.080]   to anytime you're getting anything,
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:23.200]   even if it's the concierge giving you their business card.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:24.560]   I think in American culture, it's like,
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.920]   "Thanks, throw it in your pocket,"
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:28.480]   and I find that anytime you're getting anything,
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.280]   just holding it and accepting it and appreciating it
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:34.440]   is a sign of respect that goes a long way
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:38.400]   and is much more the standard of receiving things in Japan.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:39.520]   - Yeah, if you're expecting someone
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:43.920]   to be an engaged shop owner, be an engaged customer.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:45.800]   This is, again, that give and take.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.520]   You're part of the social dynamic.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.520]   Not everything is just coming to you.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:53.040]   - So, we said we were gonna not go as deep
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.520]   on other places as we did on Tokyo and Kyoto,
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.280]   but I do wanna highlight some of them,
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:00.780]   because I think people who have that extra few days
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:02.320]   where they wanna go see something more
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.720]   than just Tokyo and Kyoto, or people who are coming back
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.280]   and wanna see something else,
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:09.560]   you did a high level of the four islands
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.680]   and a little bit of the vibe on each,
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.600]   but what are some emerging destinations
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:17.440]   or interesting places that you'd suggest people go to?
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:20.600]   I really only have one, so I'll go first,
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:23.280]   which is we found this hotel,
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.240]   and it was kind of what you were describing,
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:28.040]   where we were looking for that kind of traditional,
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.320]   the eat breakfast and dinner in the hotel,
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:33.080]   not really go anywhere, relax experience,
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:36.280]   and so we just took a trip to a region called Niigata,
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.660]   and we stayed at this amazing design hotel
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.400]   called Satoyamo Jujo,
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.560]   which I would say it's not quite a ryokan,
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.320]   but in that we weren't sleeping on tatami mats
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.200]   and it wasn't that traditional, but it was amazing,
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.360]   and that town was known for soba,
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:53.380]   so we walked around town and walked by a school,
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:55.920]   and it was definitely not a popular destination
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.280]   in the season we went,
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.960]   but that was just an awesome hotel
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:02.240]   and relaxing experience for a couple days,
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.420]   and that's all I have,
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:05.240]   so I'm gonna turn the entirety
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.480]   of non-Tokyo, Kyoto, Japan over to you.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.200]   So I'll circle back on that idea
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:12.600]   of what are the ingredients for a perfect first
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.320]   or fourth trip to Japan,
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:17.720]   which is old and new, mountains and sea,
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:20.480]   and I think all of them are really easy to hit.
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.840]   You can hit them all very close to Tokyo,
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:26.760]   even if you only have a shorter trip.
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:29.880]   I spent quite a bit of time in Kyushu
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:33.300]   in the southernmost main island this time around
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:38.300]   because I am a major fan of onsen culture,
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.560]   hot spring culture, and because the islands
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.680]   are so active volcanically,
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:46.080]   there is just hot water gurgling up everywhere,
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:48.840]   to the point where there are hotels in Tokyo
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:52.560]   that pipe in hot water from miles and miles and miles away
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:56.480]   to have that mineral water bath within the property.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:01.480]   Kyushu is sort of the motherland of onsen culture,
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:04.680]   more so than places like Hakone,
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.140]   which you might have heard of a lot
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:08.120]   because it's very close to Tokyo,
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:09.600]   so a lot of people go there.
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:12.720]   Kyushu has an Oita prefecture,
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.480]   and I should say, as an aside,
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.760]   prefectures are like states,
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:18.920]   and they all have different reputations,
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:23.360]   and they all have different local foods and vibes,
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.720]   and they all kind of compete against each other.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:30.720]   Oita prefecture on Kyushu has two major onsen towns.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:36.360]   One's called Beppu, and one's called Fuin.
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:40.080]   Both have a ton of places to stay.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:43.000]   There's an international university in Beppu,
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.200]   and a lot of people that go there
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.680]   work in some of these hotels,
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.960]   so the level of English in Beppu is better than in Tokyo,
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.720]   which is very confusing.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:53.840]   And you can choose from a variety of types of properties.
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:56.520]   There's an intercontinental in Beppu, for example,
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:59.400]   if you want the comfort of something familiar,
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:02.120]   or you can go all the way down to a very traditional inn
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.720]   while you're sleeping on tatami.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:05.680]   If you've ever looked at a photo of Beppu,
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:07.160]   it looks like it's exploding.
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:10.240]   There's just steam coming up from every vent
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:11.520]   as you walk down the street.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.400]   It's really cool.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.600]   Yufuin is in the mountains,
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.400]   and it's a little bit more rural.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.960]   Major tourism destination as well,
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:24.320]   as far as onsen and hot springs culture goes.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:28.320]   There is a very prescribed way that you soak in onsen.
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.880]   You must wash yourself before you go in,
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:32.800]   and you must be naked.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.080]   And if that's uncomfortable for you,
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:40.080]   IHG hotels have a variety of hot spring hybrid hotels
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:42.600]   all throughout the country.
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.720]   I would just look at their Japan offerings.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.400]   They have a property in Hakone, for example,
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:49.360]   that you can go in your bathing suit,
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.360]   and you can go, if you're traveling
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.280]   with someone of the opposite gender,
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:56.200]   you can also go and bathe together.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.480]   - I'm gonna give the opposite advice,
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:59.280]   which is if you're uncomfortable with it,
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.560]   try to get comfortable with it.
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:05.000]   - Oh yeah, I am all about the real onsen experience.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.960]   - You're right, I shouldn't just give the caveat.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:10.560]   Absolutely dive in headfirst, pun intended.
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.800]   This is absolutely something that you can try,
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:15.320]   and in the way that you always see in the news
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:18.440]   every once in a while, so-and-so, oldest man in the world,
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:22.080]   what is his secret to living till 126?
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:26.280]   So many of these people are from Kyushu, from Beppu,
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:28.800]   and they all talk about how hot spring culture
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:32.240]   is so important to them, and it's so profound
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:34.440]   and widespread in Oita Prefecture
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:36.840]   that a lot of houses don't have running water
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.880]   because they have an onsen down the street,
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.560]   and every morning and every evening they go and soak,
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:42.960]   and they talk with their friends.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:46.280]   There's a major social component to this as well.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.080]   - That sounds like a place that I've never been
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:48.920]   and want to go.
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:52.360]   It left off Hakone 'cause we did go there on an early trip,
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:55.080]   and it's beautiful, Mount Fuji in the background.
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:55.960]   It was wonderful.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:58.800]   Any other thoughts on whether a day trip
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.840]   or a side trip from Tokyo or Kyoto,
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:03.300]   or even flight somewhere else, or train?
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:06.680]   - Yeah, I think you're on the right track
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.240]   with a trip out to Hakone.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:10.960]   It's just this weird prescribed thing
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:13.320]   that a lot of operators have people do,
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.200]   and it's just become this sort of golden circle thing
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:18.160]   where you're like, "Okay, I'm going to Tokyo and Hakone,
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:21.280]   "and then Kyoto, and we're done."
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:24.920]   Outside of Hakone, in the greater Fuji area,
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.440]   there are some incredible places to stay
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:31.920]   and some incredibly beautiful and natural environments.
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:34.560]   There's the five Fuji lakes.
[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.240]   I would have a look into those.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.200]   Those are nestled right under the mountain,
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:41.380]   all have incredible views.
[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:43.960]   That is something that's specifically different
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:46.520]   than the Hakone experience.
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:51.520]   I really like Shuzenji as a little town.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:54.600]   There's a really cool place to stay there,
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:57.360]   a couple cool places, ranging from budget to high end.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:01.240]   This is small town Japan, and it's really close to Tokyo.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:06.240]   North of Tokyo is Nikko, a major UNESCO site.
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.280]   A lot of people, for some reason,
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:10.960]   do it as a day trip from Tokyo.
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:13.280]   Do not do it as a day trip.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:15.680]   It is so far, you will be tired,
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.900]   and you're missing the beauty of it,
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:19.960]   which is the evening after all the crowds are gone.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.120]   You can go see the UNESCO protected sites,
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:25.480]   but for me, Lake Shuzenji is stunning,
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:26.920]   and there are a few really cool places
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.360]   to stay on the lake there.
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.360]   Though a big question that I get is,
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.720]   how do I do Kyoto without going to Kyoto?
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:36.360]   Because the crowds, there's already conversations
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:40.480]   about how to curb overcrowding in Kyoto.
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.120]   So a lot of people are opting
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:45.680]   to go to Kanazawa instead of Kyoto.
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:48.400]   Kanazawa, back in feudal times,
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:52.960]   different feudal entities measured their wealth by rice,
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:54.400]   how much rice they were making.
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.200]   Rice was currency.
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:59.480]   And after the stronghold in Kyoto,
[01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:02.960]   Kanazawa, the Maeda clan, were the second wealthiest.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:06.600]   There's a lot of that old culture still intact.
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:09.360]   One of the most beautiful gardens in all of Japan,
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.340]   and the Japanese rank their gardens,
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:13.360]   and there are three that are considered the nicest,
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.460]   and one of them is in Kanazawa.
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:18.760]   This is that little Kyoto that you're gonna get
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.060]   with far less people.
[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:23.200]   It's much smaller, but if you're allergic to crowds,
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.400]   this is the place for you.
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:27.560]   And Kaga Prefecture, the area around it,
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:31.720]   is also a teeming onsen destination.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.720]   I have mixed feelings about Hokkaido.
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:36.520]   Grew up in Canada, I was born with skis on,
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.840]   love a good ski trip.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:41.760]   Hokkaido has japao, incredible powder.
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:44.520]   I have really mixed feelings about going to Japan
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:45.520]   for the skiing.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:48.360]   I think you can get great skiing in Canada.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:51.000]   You can get great skiing in the US.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.920]   I think it's a bit of a shame to devote your Japanese holiday
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:59.200]   to something that you can do really well in other places.
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:04.100]   So I'm a bit allergic to recommending a ski trip
[01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:05.160]   with your Japan trip.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:07.680]   Instead, I would pick places that you're really
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:09.880]   getting culturally fulfilled.
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:11.080]   - We love to ski.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:14.180]   We have not done skiing in Japan for that reason.
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:15.020]   I think a part of us is like,
[01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:16.800]   "Oh, it'd be so interesting to do that,
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:20.640]   but how could we prioritize that over all?"
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:21.480]   I don't think I've ever been
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:25.240]   to all these amazing other prefectures, islands even.
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.480]   We've stayed so central.
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:29.200]   Gosh, I feel like there is an infinite more Japan
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:30.040]   for us to see.
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.240]   The fact that you feel the same way after 20 years
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:34.240]   makes me feel like it'll just be
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.980]   on the rotation constantly.
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:38.560]   And it's probably the country we've been to the most,
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:40.320]   other than of course, where we live.
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:43.400]   Any other final thoughts, tips,
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:44.800]   things that you have on your notes
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.420]   that maybe we should have said earlier,
[01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:48.920]   but didn't, that are worth sharing?
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:52.040]   - I think we're pretty, I have a couple of random ones.
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:52.960]   - Okay, go.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.240]   - So one, shopping is fantastic,
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:01.240]   but if you are in any way very tall in the US,
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:03.560]   it is a very interesting experience.
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:05.680]   I think I'm like a 2XL.
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:09.680]   I couldn't find any shoes and pants fit me like capris,
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.080]   and I'm only six feet tall.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.760]   So keep that in mind when shopping,
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.880]   because it could be a difficult experience if you fall.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.860]   My brother-in-law basically couldn't buy anything
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:20.580]   because he was so tall.
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:21.760]   So that was one.
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:24.700]   On the general side, we didn't talk at all about Osaka,
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:26.960]   but I would say, as you mentioned
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:28.440]   before we started recording,
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:29.800]   it's known as the food city,
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:31.720]   but the entire country is a food country.
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:33.920]   So you don't necessarily need to go there
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.920]   and go out of your way.
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:38.580]   But if you are there, fantastic Okonomiyaki.
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:40.880]   I believe Osaka is kind of known for it.
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.520]   That's a thing to hit up there.
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:45.000]   And there's a bar in Osaka called Bible Club,
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.680]   which was one of the coolest like speakeasy-ish bars
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.960]   I've ever been to, and I'd put that on your list.
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:54.760]   - I would also just add that,
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:57.280]   this is maybe something that you don't wanna hear.
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:01.720]   It is the best place to just indulge
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:04.200]   in the joy of exploration.
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:07.520]   And it can be really hard for FOMOists,
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:10.280]   but you're not gonna go wrong.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:13.120]   You can go to New York City and go wrong.
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:16.180]   You could end up at an Olive Garden by accident.
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:17.020]   You know what I mean?
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:19.120]   I always wanna tell readers of my guidebook,
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:24.040]   go to Ebisu Station in Tokyo and go to Ebisu Yokocho.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:25.880]   You can Google it, you'll find where it is.
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:30.800]   It is like a little kind of street foodie indoor area,
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:33.120]   and just pick one of the stalls.
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.240]   You're gonna see they all cook one thing.
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:37.160]   What's the thing that looks delicious to you?
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:40.720]   Rather than hyper-focusing on the one place
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:41.720]   that you have to go,
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:45.580]   there are tens of thousands of restaurants to choose from.
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:47.240]   So many of them are incredible.
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:49.880]   It's such a great destination to come home
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:52.200]   and say, "I found this place."
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:53.920]   You get to have a little bit of ownership
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:55.320]   over your own experience.
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.680]   Certainly talk to your friends
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:57.640]   about the things that they've done.
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:59.960]   Certainly go to the places that we're recommending here.
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:02.920]   But take the opportunity to add serendipity
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:03.800]   into your schedule.
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:06.280]   It's the best country to do it.
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.800]   - I love that recommendation.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:10.200]   Half of the recommendations I have
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:12.080]   are just places we randomly found.
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:14.320]   Certainly, the rest of them might be things
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:17.540]   that we found in books or on tabloid or anything.
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:19.460]   The one last thing I'm gonna ask you
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:22.820]   is because someone wrote in and asked about Naoshima Island,
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:25.540]   do you have any thoughts on visiting there?
[01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:30.540]   - So the Satoshi Inland Sea has a lot of different islands.
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:33.900]   And if you dip into the history of how that all came about,
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:35.300]   it's really fascinating.
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:38.180]   It's a really compelling conservation project
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:42.700]   to redevelop a destination that was deemed undesirable.
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:44.960]   Rather than just having a pit stop,
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:48.700]   I would recommend going to a variety
[01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:51.260]   of the different islands in that area.
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:53.640]   It's a really upcoming destination,
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:57.040]   not just because of all the art that's there,
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.820]   but new and interesting hotels are being built.
[01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:04.820]   There's a big push to keep populations in smaller places
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:08.000]   and not have everyone move to Tokyo or Osaka.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.420]   There's a lot of government money that's being spent,
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:12.160]   and that is one of the destinations
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:14.420]   that's continuing to grow.
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:16.940]   So I would expand your holiday there
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:19.100]   rather than it just being a beat.
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:20.100]   - I haven't been there,
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:23.140]   so that's yet one more thing to put on the list
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:24.300]   for the next trip,
[01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:26.700]   which if we're gonna try to do it without kids,
[01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:28.580]   it's gonna be shorter than we wanted
[01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:30.320]   or farther away in the future.
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.780]   So this has been amazing.
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:34.700]   As I think to the future of episodes like this,
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:35.940]   I'm gonna start to wonder
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:38.540]   whether it makes sense to try to do a country.
[01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:40.920]   It was always a gamble whether we do countries or cities.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.540]   So I appreciate you indulging in this crazy idea.
[01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:47.380]   And obviously you've written blog posts,
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:50.900]   articles, stories, guidebooks, all about Japan.
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:53.620]   Where can people stay on top of everything you're doing
[01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:55.020]   and everything you're up to?
[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:57.620]   - I write for a variety of different publications.
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:00.060]   So I keep an archive of those articles
[01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:01.660]   at brandimpressor.com.
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:03.740]   I'm active on my Instagram,
[01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:07.260]   shooting real-time photos of the destinations that I'm in.
[01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:09.460]   My handle is @brandpress,
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:12.160]   the first five letters of my first name and last name.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.720]   And you can find all of my stories on Japan
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:17.120]   in every publication from "Travel and Leisure,"
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:19.240]   "Bloomberg," "Cutting Ass Traveler,"
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:21.360]   "The Daily Beast," and so forth.
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:24.040]   And I'll send them your way so that you can have a look.
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:24.880]   - That's awesome.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.120]   We'll put some of those in the show notes.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:28.720]   But I asked Brandon what would make this a huge win for him
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:29.840]   for coming on for an hour.
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.400]   And on the recording mark, we're almost at two.
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:33.240]   And he said, "You know what?
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:34.660]   "I post a lot of cool stuff on Instagram.
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:36.280]   "I'd love more people to see that."
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.880]   So if you're listening, go check out his Instagram.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:42.160]   If you like to be inspired by awesome photos of travels,
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:43.440]   give him a follow.
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:46.080]   And if you wanna hear some crazy stories,
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.760]   when we had him on last time, we talked about his book
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:51.240]   about the wild pirate craziness
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.080]   of the history of the Pitcairn Islands.
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:54.920]   Go back and listen to our episode.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:56.840]   We not only talked about traveling,
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:59.040]   like a local and not just a tourist
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.640]   and some crazy other things about travel,
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:02.820]   but we talked about some of the crazy stories from that.
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:03.940]   It's an awesome book.
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:05.640]   Definitely check that out too.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:08.320]   Brandon, thank you for staying on for so long
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.960]   and being here today.
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:10.800]   - It was my pleasure.
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:11.920]   That was so much fun.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:16.480]   - Wow, I have never been so excited for a trip
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:17.920]   that I'm not even planning yet
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:20.800]   than I am right now for taking my next trip to Japan.
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:22.880]   And by the way, I've been there four times
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.800]   and I'm still so excited.
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:27.120]   So I have no idea when we're gonna get to do it
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.320]   because I think we're still a little bit overwhelmed
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:32.120]   about traveling with two kids after going to Europe.
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:33.840]   But I am really, really excited.
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.680]   I hope you liked this episode.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:38.480]   I hope if you haven't been considering a trip to Japan,
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:39.720]   you are now.
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:41.060]   And if you're already considering it,
[01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:43.400]   I hope you're sold and you're ready to go.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:44.960]   And I know I said that I wanna make sure
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:46.840]   these episodes include a section
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:48.780]   about how to get there with points and miles,
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:51.680]   how to book flights, where to get the best deals,
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:53.180]   where to stay in hotels
[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:55.060]   and where the best deals for points are there,
[01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:57.640]   as well as any other deals and hacks I've learned
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:58.560]   or collected.
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:01.360]   So I'm gonna release a bonus episode on Friday
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.560]   that'll cover all of those things.
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.280]   And I really hope you enjoy it,
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:07.180]   but also please let me know what you think
[01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:09.080]   of these travel episodes in general,
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:10.440]   because I know it's a little bit different
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:12.680]   from what I've done in the past 100 episodes.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:15.400]   And I know that not everyone is looking to travel to Japan.
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:18.560]   So I am curious what you think, would love feedback.
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:20.440]   And I've got a couple of these planned,
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:21.680]   but I am really trying to decide
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:23.180]   whether I make this a monthly thing
[01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:25.560]   and also whether we try to tackle a country
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.560]   or just really go deep on a city.
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:30.600]   So I've got another one I've recorded with Lee Rowan
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:32.320]   on everything about Italy.
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:34.840]   But after that, I really wanna try to decide what's best.
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.320]   So please let me know what you think.
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:39.600]   Please send feedback and thank you so much for joining.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:40.500]   See you Friday.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:43.080]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:45.660]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:48.240]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:58.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
