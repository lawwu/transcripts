[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.500]   - In the last podcast, you shared with us
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.620]   from Philippians chapter two,
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.040]   and the effect of murmuring on our mission in the world,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.660]   and what our complaining says about God.
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.760]   There's more to it from Matthew chapter five.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.060]   Continue explaining this for us.
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.860]   Explain to us this connection
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.940]   between salt, light, and complaining.
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.540]   - Well, I will probably say something
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.820]   by way of explanation, but really,
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.060]   what I feel is that the Lord wasn't done with me
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.580]   on the Lord's day when he showed me
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.180]   Philippians chapter two, verse 14,
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.060]   do all things without complaining and reasonings.
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.020]   And the reason it convicted me so much at that time
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.620]   was because it went on to say,
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.260]   you live in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation,
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.060]   and you shine as lights.
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.700]   And the light is doing all things without complaining.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.460]   Being the kind of person who's not a grumbler,
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.620]   and a murmur, and a complainer,
[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.620]   and a self-justifying arguer with people
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.140]   while you have every right to complain.
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.740]   And so he showed me all that.
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.620]   He broke me because of my bent to complaining.
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.460]   And then he wasn't done with me,
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.560]   and he took me to Matthew five.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.660]   Blessed are you when others revile you,
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.140]   and persecute you, and utter all kinds of evil
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.340]   against you falsely.
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.740]   Now that's where you start complaining, right?
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.540]   If somebody, like if my wife says something
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.540]   that wasn't true, I'm frustrated, I'm angry, I'm irritated,
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.620]   and then I start to reason in my mind
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.500]   how I should talk about this,
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.060]   and just everything starts to churn inside of me
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.060]   in terms of self-defense and outcomes,
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.300]   complaining, and if I don't deal with it,
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.060]   it just can go on and on.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.180]   So that's what happens, whether it's at home,
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.900]   or at work, or on a blog, or somewhere,
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.460]   you get persecuted, or somebody says something falsely
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.780]   against you, you complain, you murmur, you grumble,
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.500]   and here's what Jesus says.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.980]   When that happens, when you're treated badly,
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.220]   rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.020]   So men persecuted the prophets who were before you,
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.020]   and I thought, this is Philippians 2:14 stated positively.
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.220]   Philippians 2:14 said, "Do all things without grumbling,
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.620]   "that you may shine as a light in the midst
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.100]   "of a crooked and first generation."
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.200]   And here it says, "Rejoice and be glad,"
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.580]   which is the opposite of complaining and grumbling.
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.700]   Rejoice when you experience something
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.800]   that would make ordinary people complain.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.580]   And then, the arrow, just like last time,
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.020]   the arrow went deeper because I went on and read,
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.860]   just what, three verses later, four verses later,
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.100]   "You're the light of the world."
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.300]   And I thought, I've never seen that before.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.320]   In Philippians 2, "Do all things without murmuring,
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.920]   "and you'll shine like a light in the midst
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.140]   "of a crooked and perverse generation."
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.940]   Matthew 5, "Rejoice and be glad
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.760]   "when you're persecuted and slandered,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.220]   "for you're the light of the world,
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.420]   "a city set on a hill."
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.220]   Now I know, verse 16 says, "Let your light so shine
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.460]   "that men may see your good deeds."
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.500]   But I wanna say, doesn't he mean they're not just good deeds,
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.220]   I mean, the world can do good deeds.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.820]   It's good deeds without murmuring.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.280]   It's good deeds without complaining.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.720]   It's good deeds rejoicing
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.860]   when those good deeds aren't appreciated,
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.620]   when those good deeds are misinterpreted,
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.380]   when those good deeds are criticized.
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.940]   Rejoice in that day.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.860]   "The Lord wasn't done with me yet."
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.700]   In other words, there was more to do,
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.180]   both by way of illumination.
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.580]   If you've never seen this, John,
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.500]   that the light of the world,
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.580]   the light of the church is a freedom
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.460]   from complaining and grumbling and murmuring,
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.500]   and instead, a joy.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.500]   And here was the new precious gift
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.100]   of how to fight the battle,
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.740]   "For great is your reward in heaven."
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.220]   I had seen from Philippians that when I was murmuring,
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.620]   I was putting out my light
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.240]   about the brightness of God's power
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.300]   and the brightness of his wisdom
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.300]   and the brightness of his kindness.
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.660]   And now I saw, when I'm complaining,
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.540]   I'm putting out the brightness of his reward.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.900]   I'm saying, "Well, the payoff for this experience right now
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.900]   "that I'm having, this slander, isn't very good."
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.340]   And Jesus is saying, "Oh, yes, it is very good."
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.940]   (laughs)
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.140]   Your reward in heaven for enduring
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.340]   what you're going through right now
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.420]   with not complaining but rejoicing
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.180]   will be off the charts glorious.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.220]   And so my battle right now, Tony,
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.220]   is to not just believe that God's been kind to me in the past
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.560]   which he has by dying for me and forgiving me,
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   but that he intends a reward for every patient act,
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.180]   every non-complaining act,
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.120]   he intends a reward that's just unspeakably great.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.440]   Very, very true.
