[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.400]   - Do you think on the autonomous vehicle space,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.340]   it's possible to solve the problem of full autonomy
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.240]   without significant investment in infrastructure?
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.600]   - Well, that's really hard to speculate.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.160]   I think it's not a yes, no question,
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.920]   but how long does it take question?
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.360]   15 years, 30 years, 45 years.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.160]   Clearly with infrastructure augmentation,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.500]   whether it's road, city, or whole city planning,
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.680]   building a new city,
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.520]   I'm sure that will accelerate the day of the L5.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.480]   I'm not knowledgeable enough,
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.120]   and it's hard to predict even when we're knowledgeable
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.260]   because a lot of it is speculative.
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.640]   But in the US, I don't think people would consider
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.440]   building a new city the size of Chicago
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.120]   to make it the AI/autonomous city.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.080]   There are smaller ones being built, I'm aware of that.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.200]   But is infrastructure spend really impossible
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.900]   for US or Western countries?
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.920]   I don't think so.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.120]   The US highway system was built.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.160]   Was that during President Eisenhower or Kennedy?
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.360]   Eisenhower, yeah.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.440]   So maybe historians can study
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.480]   how did President Eisenhower get the resources
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.980]   to build this massive infrastructure
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.760]   that surely gave US a tremendous amount of prosperity
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.880]   over the next decade, if not century.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.040]   (silence)
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.200]   (silence)
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.360]   (silence)
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.520]   (silence)
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.680]   (silence)
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.840]   (silence)
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.000]   (silence)
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
