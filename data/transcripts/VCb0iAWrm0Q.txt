[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   The fascinating thing about Lee Kuan Yew is he took three important decisions right at the beginning for Singapore.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.760]   Each one of them now seems obvious. Each one at the time was deeply contested.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.400]   Number one, he said, everyone's going to speak English in Singapore.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.000]   Now, there are lots of people who said to him at the time, no, no, we need to have our own local language.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.280]   You know, we need to be true to our roots and everything.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.440]   He said, no, English is the language of the world and we're all going to speak English.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.680]   Secondly, he said, we're going to get the best intellectual capital from whatever exists in the world and we're going to bring it to Singapore.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.120]   And again, people said, no, we should stand on our own two feet.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.000]   And you're also bringing in the British who we just, you know, we've got all these disputes with.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.800]   And he said, no, I'm going to bring in the best from wherever they are and they're going to come to Singapore.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.960]   And the third thing he did was he said there's going to be no corruption.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.880]   And one of the ways we're going to do that is we're going to make sure our political leaders are well paid,
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.880]   which the Singapore leaders are the best paid in the world, and there's going to be zero tolerance of corruption.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.280]   Those are the three decisions that were instrumental in building Singapore today.
