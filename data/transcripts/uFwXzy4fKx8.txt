[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Look at Christ and what do you see in Him? The answer to that question
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.200]   determines everything, as Pastor John explained why in his message at Passion
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:23.440]   to 20,000 students in Atlanta on January 3rd, 2015. Here's what he said.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:32.320]   My guess is that for many of you, this language is not the way you grew up
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:42.880]   talking about the gospel. I don't know that you are familiar with anyone saying
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:51.960]   "When Christ died for me, the best thing he purchased for me is the greatest gift
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.600]   of the love of God, namely God's gift of the beauty of God to satisfy my soul
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.280]   forever." I don't know how many of you ever talked that way, or when you got saved
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.400]   think "That's what happened." So here's why I'm preaching on this. I want
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.380]   you, true Christian, to know that happened to you and you've experienced that. Nobody
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.120]   may have ever taught you the language to use to define what God really did in
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.960]   your life, and then there's others of you who've been playing this game called
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.120]   religion because it's a cool group on your campus and you've never seen it. I'm
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.800]   talking a foreign language to you right now. I don't even know what you mean by the
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.200]   beauty of God. I want you to see. So I've got three answers to this last question.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.000]   What difference will it make in your life? Here's number one. If you believe,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.520]   which passion does and I do, that the greatest good of the gospel is the gift
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.920]   of the beauty of God for your everlasting enjoyment. If you believe
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:20.320]   that, implication number one is your saving faith is not at root a decision
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:31.880]   about Christ's truth but a sight of Christ's glory. Say it again. First
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:41.280]   implication is at root -- this is important -- at root your faith, your saving faith
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:50.080]   is not a decision about the truth of Christ. At root it is a seeing of the
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:03:03.180]   beauty of Christ, the all-satisfying, all- compelling beauty of Christ. When you are
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.200]   confronted with infinite, all-satisfying beauty, the question is not "So what's
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:25.560]   your decision?" The question is "What do you see?" Do you see Christ in the gospel
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.800]   as beautiful? More beautiful, more glorious, more satisfying than anything
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.120]   else? That's the question. That is the root question. When you are presented
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:49.200]   with infinite beauty, all-satisfying beauty, the question is not "So what's your
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:58.840]   decision?" Picture yourself in an art class and the teacher holds up a
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:12.760]   beautiful painting and you look at it and find it boring and the teacher says
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:26.860]   to you "So?" Make up your mind. Decide. Is it beautiful or is it boring? Your proper
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:40.120]   response to the teacher is "It doesn't work like that. You show me a painting, I
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.480]   think it's boring, and you're telling me decide. Decide. It's not what you do when you
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.720]   see something. You don't decide. You just either see it as boring or you see it as
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.200]   beautiful. You don't decide. Just see it as beautiful. If you tell me I'm supposed to
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.640]   write on the test, it's beautiful, I can do that, but there's a name for that. It's
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.680]   called lying or hypocrisy."
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:24.040]   You can't decide yourself into seeing as beautiful what you think is boring. It
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:32.720]   doesn't work like that. You would be right to respond to her that way or him.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:45.520]   Deciding isn't what gets you there. I was 18 once. You know how long ago that was?
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:06:00.240]   50 years. And I sang a song. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:12.720]   to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. No turning back. No turning back. I
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:24.400]   sang that. I loved that. I meant that. And I'm singing it now and meaning it. It's a
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:42.000]   good song. However, I have learned something. Beneath and before I could
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:51.160]   ever decide to lay my life down in the discipleship of Jesus Christ, I had to
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:58.780]   see Him. Otherwise, I'm playing with Him. Does somebody get an arm on my back? It
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:09.920]   might be called hell. Might be called approval of parents. They're just making me do
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.280]   this, but I haven't seen anything. I haven't seen anything beautiful. I haven't seen anything
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:29.560]   infinitely worthy of my affections. But I had seen. I had. So when I sang it, I meant it.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.800]   Beautiful. That clip was taken from John Piper's conference message titled "Why do
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:41.040]   Christians preach and sing at Passion in Atlanta?" to 20,000 students on January
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.080]   3rd, 2015. The full message, both audio and video, can be found at DesiringGod.org.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.120]   And if you have a favorite clip from a John Piper sermon, old or new, email us
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.600]   the name of the sermon and a timestamp of when and where the clip occurs in the

[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.880]   the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:11.080]   Tomorrow, a podcast listener wants to know if John Piper had a chance to meet
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.000]   Jonathan Edwards, what questions would he ask him? I'm your host Tony Reinke. I'll
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.320]   see you tomorrow.
