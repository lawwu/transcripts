[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Well, why did God need part of Adam to make Eve when he made Adam from the dust?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.560]   It's a Bible question from a female listener to the podcast.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.600]   We don't have her name, but we have her question.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.680]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.520]   I was just wondering why God chose to do surgery on Adam to remove one of his ribs to craft
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.640]   Eve, when as God, he could have just made Eve entirely from dust in the same way he
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.640]   made Adam.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.440]   I am very intrigued by this fact in Genesis and wonder if you have any thoughts to explain
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.360]   why it was done this way and if it carries any particular meaning that he did it in such
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.360]   a way.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.360]   Thank you."
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.760]   Well, it is intriguing, and there are things to see in the text that we might miss that
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.720]   would make it even more intriguing if we didn't read more slowly.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:01.840]   So let's read the passage that she's referring to, and then I'll point out some maybe surprising
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.840]   conclusions.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.600]   "Then the Lord God said," I'm reading in Genesis 2, verse 18 to 25.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:19.400]   "Then the Lord God said, 'It is not good that man should be alone.'"
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:27.440]   So God is going to finish his creation so as to make it completely good.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.760]   That's the setup at the beginning of the paragraph.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.200]   I'm going to make this completely good.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.840]   It's not yet finished.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.280]   I will make him a helper fit for him.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.840]   That word fit means suitable, proper, corresponding to.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:54.200]   Verse 19, "Now out of the ground the Lord God had formed," or formed, "every beast."
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:03.160]   I think it's important to notice that he's looking for a helper fit for Adam to complete
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:11.200]   his creation, and he starts by making from the ground animals of the field and every
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   bird of the heavens, and he brought them to the man.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.880]   That phrase is going to turn up again when he says he brought the woman to the man.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.440]   So hang on to that.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.600]   To see what he would call them.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.320]   So the man's going to name these animals in order to discern their nature, which means
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.440]   their fitness for being a suitable counterpart to him.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.880]   And he's going to wind up naming this woman as well.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.960]   So we've got this parallel betweenâ€”let's start with the animals and see what happens,
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.840]   and then move from there.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.040]   And whatever the man called every living creature, that was his name, its name.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.240]   The man names the beast, discerning its nature, its fitness to be his partner.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.520]   The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.000]   of the field.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.760]   But for Adam, there was not found a helper fit for him, the text says.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.800]   So his first step that he took was to produce a suitable helper in animals, and that totally
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.400]   failed.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.760]   We need to ask, why would God do that?
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.200]   Why would God enter on a process of making animals when he knew that's not going to work?
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.640]   That's not going to find a suitable partner.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.080]   So verse 21, "So the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept,
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:45.240]   took one of his ribs," the word can mean side, so not from his foot and not from his head,
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.000]   but from his side, "and closed it up in its place," closed up the flesh.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.800]   So he really did surgery.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.960]   He opened the skin and took out a rib and he closed it.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:04.480]   And the rib that the Lord had taken from the man he made, literally he built, into a woman
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.480]   and brought her to the man, just like it says he had brought the animals to the man.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:20.660]   And then the man said, "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.400]   She shall be called," and that's a reference back to the naming of the animals.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:34.080]   So I've found now an essence, a reality, a character, a being like me.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.580]   She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man.
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.840]   She shall be called Isha because she was taken out of Ish in the Hebrew.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.320]   Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.840]   they shall become one flesh.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.560]   The man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed."
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.440]   Now our friend asks about the significance of the woman being made from the man's side
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.120]   or rib and not from the ground.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.520]   And I would say that's not an incidental part of the text.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.880]   She's right to ask.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.560]   To see the significance, we need to follow what's happening.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.720]   First Adam is said to be alone, and that's not good.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.680]   So the text is designed to tell us how God makes his creation finally good, namely with
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.540]   Adam not being alone.
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:32.440]   But the next thing that happens is odd, namely making all the animals or the pointing out
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.440]   that God had made all the animals and brings them to the man.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.040]   So note three things.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.920]   One, he says explicitly that they were made from the ground.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.720]   Second, they were brought to the man for naming.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.680]   And third, his naming is connected with whether the animals are fit or suitable helpers for
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.680]   him.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:03.080]   So Adam, in naming the animals, is in fact identifying their nature, their fitness, or
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.800]   suitability for him as a kind of partner that would make creation finally and fully good.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.780]   And one might ask, why did God parade the animals before Adam in search of a helper
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.400]   fit for him since God knew he wouldn't find one?
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.900]   And my answer is, he did it precisely because he knew he wouldn't find one.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:33.640]   In other words, to make crystal clear to Adam, you will not find what I have designed for
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.360]   you in my mind.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.860]   You're not going to find it among the animals.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.680]   Don't even think that you could find what I have prepared among the animals.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:51.040]   The kind of helper that I have in mind for you, Adam, isn't that kind.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:07:00.000]   Verse 20, "But for Adam there was not found among all those animals a helper fit suitable
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.340]   for him."
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:08.480]   So having made that crystal clear, God puts Adam to sleep and really does surgery.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.720]   He opens his side, takes a rib, closes up the side, and then it says, "God built the
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.480]   rib from his side into a woman."
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:25.080]   And the word is ishah, and the generic word for Adam is ish, man, ish.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:31.060]   Then it says, and here he uses the very same words from earlier when he brought the animals
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.780]   to Adam to be named.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:40.420]   He says he brought her, he brought her to the man, and so we wait to see what he will
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.280]   name her.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:48.680]   That is, what nature he will find in her that corresponds to his own nature or not.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:54.980]   And here's what he says, "This at last is bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:01.320]   She shall be called ishah because she was taken out of ish."
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:09.380]   So unlike the naming of the animals, this creature's name shows she is of the very
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.400]   nature of the man.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.800]   The animals were not of the very nature, and that's probably why he took them out of
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.360]   the ground and took her out of me.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:28.660]   Adam said, "He took her from me, therefore I name her ishah because she was taken out
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.660]   of ish."
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.300]   That is, she is the suitable helper.
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:39.060]   She fits, she corresponds, she is not an animal.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.620]   She's my unique kind.
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.060]   She's human like me.
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.940]   She's one flesh with me.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:56.300]   Therefore this concept of helper is not impersonal like an animal, like oxen can be helpers to
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.300]   farmers.
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.440]   She's different.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.920]   She will be essentially personal and human like me.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:13.260]   She is like me and yet perfectly unlike me so as to be the exact suitable counterpart
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.260]   for me.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:20.680]   And that I think is true not only anatomically for the sake of sexual relations, but far
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:32.180]   deeper than that in profound personal psychological ways they are each other's perfect God-designed
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.860]   complements.
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.420]   Together they are good.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.680]   Now it's good.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:47.000]   Creation is good that man and woman are now both created in the image of God of the same
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.340]   human nature, bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, and he could have said a lot more,
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.340]   I think.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:10:04.540]   Then the next verse takes this complementary perfect correspondence into marriage and says
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:11.920]   this, "Therefore, because they were made bone of bone and flesh of flesh, therefore
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.780]   this profound oneness of nature is going to be found in marriage.
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:22.380]   Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother, hold fast to his wife, they shall
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.380]   become one flesh."
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:31.660]   So he just said she is bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, and now in marriage they become
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.780]   one flesh.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:39.940]   The marriage union takes the unity of male and female to its deepest physical psychological
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:46.820]   personal level, and that becomes a picture, a drama, the New Testament says, of Christ
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.300]   and the church.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:58.460]   Now there's a lot more to say about the implications of man being made first, the woman being made
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:06.420]   from man and for his perfectly suited helper, and the woman becoming in Genesis 3.20 the
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:12.340]   mother of all the living, and Paul draws out these implications in 1 Corinthians 11, 8
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:19.460]   to 12, but for now I would say God's aim in not making the woman from the ground like
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:29.200]   the animals, but from Adam's rib, his side, was to make clear to him and to us that she
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:37.060]   is radically, gloriously, profoundly human like Adam over against all the animals who
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:42.100]   were utterly unsuited for man.
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.100]   Glorious fellow heirs of eternity and potential queens of heaven.
