[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   I'm Cal Newport and this is my first weekly update video.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.600]   Now the idea with this series is to give you a look inside my life as a professional writer,
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.680]   professor and podcaster.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.000]   I want to get into some of my own personal struggles to work deeply in an increasingly
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   distracted world.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:34.040]   So here's the plan for today's episode.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.680]   I want to start by giving you quick updates on the book I'm writing, what's happening
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.480]   with our podcast Deep Questions and my academic research.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.240]   After I'm done with those updates, for the first time ever, I'm going to reveal to you
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.640]   a look in this Deep Work HQ hideaway where I retreat to do a lot of my own deep thinking.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.840]   It's a hideaway above a storefront in downtown Tacoma Park.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.240]   So I'll give you a look around what's going on here.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.240]   Let's start by giving you an update on the book I'm writing.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.160]   So here's the background.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.080]   I'm under contract with the Portfolio Imprint of Penguin Random House to write a book titled
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.980]   Slow Productivity.
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.840]   The current subtitle is The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.800]   This will be my eighth book, believe it or not.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.480]   It'll probably fall somewhere between 70,000 to 90,000 words when all is said and done.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.380]   My current due date is March, but I'll tell you my plan is to get this done earlier.
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.920]   So right now, what am I trying to do with the book?
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.320]   Well, in the month of October, when I'm recording this, I have a chapter I'm trying to finish.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.500]   So I have synced up one chapter to this month.
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.080]   I'm more or less on track to actually get this writing done in time.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.120]   But I will say there have been some struggles.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.260]   The main issue I'm having with not only this book right now, but also with some of my New
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.800]   Yorker writing is second draft syndrome.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.240]   So I'm a big believer in take your time, figure out what you're going to write.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.360]   I like to walk, develop my outlines, take careful notes, gather my sources.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.040]   And then when I write, try to get it right the first time.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.000]   So after that, you're really just editing the language.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.920]   And I am finding myself section after section in this chapter, writing 1,000, 2,000 words,
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.920]   taking my time.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.920]   It'll take me two days.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.680]   So I'm doing careful prose and having to go back and extensively rewrite.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.000]   And it's always in these second rewrites that I get what I like.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.520]   And so I've been a little bit frustrated about this.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.140]   It's happening in my book.
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.040]   This happened with almost every one of my recent New Yorker pieces, especially when
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.320]   the longer form ones I write.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.120]   And I step back and say, no, no, no, I got to take another swing at it.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.080]   So that's a struggle, but I'm overcoming it.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.880]   Now, people are curious, what is my writing habit right now?
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.600]   Well, because I'm not teaching, I have flexibility on my schedule.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.320]   And so what I'm doing, my ideal writing schedule I've been implementing this fall so far is
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.880]   first thing every morning, six days a week.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.300]   Regular writing on Shabbat, Saturday.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.460]   Every other day, write two to four hours, depending on what my schedule allows.
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.580]   And that's been going well.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.440]   So this has been priority one is writing the book.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.260]   I'm hitting my benchmarks.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.260]   I'm not ahead of schedule.
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.260]   I'm not behind schedule.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.140]   I'm having the second draft issue, but I'm just upping my hours to compensate for it.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.140]   So progress is occurring.
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.620]   If you want to get a look at what my writing life encounters day to day, I'll show you.
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.760]   Here's my computer.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.100]   This is what I'm seeing two to four hours every day.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.900]   Scrivener triple pane.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.900]   I got whatever I'm writing, research outline notes next to it, footnote inspector next
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.380]   to that so I can keep my footnotes straight.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.400]   This is what I see hour after hour, day after day.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.500]   Progress is going.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.660]   So let me just conclude my discussion of my book by I'm loading up now in Scrivener the
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.780]   full word count of everything I've written so far.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.420]   35,961.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.420]   Progress is being made, but I'm going to have to keep at it.
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.660]   And look, if you want to read what I've been writing, we'll put a link in the description
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.180]   of this video to my New Yorker archive so you can see all the articles I've written
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.180]   for them.
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.460]   If you want to learn more about my books, calnewport.com.
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.460]   It's all right there.
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.340]   All right, let's do an update on the podcast.
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.860]   So as you may or may not know, I host a podcast called Deep Questions with Cal Newport recorded
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.540]   out of the studio right here in this hideaway, my Deep Work HQ.
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.100]   So what's going on with the podcast these days?
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.860]   Well, we're still doing one episode a week.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.920]   Longtime listeners know this is a change we made last spring.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.860]   We went from a two episode a week format to one episode a week format to focus on the
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.860]   content.
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.300]   We wanted to get the show better, get the numbers up on single episodes before we went
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.060]   back to doing two episodes a week.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.260]   So we're still doing that, but we're seeing our numbers start to rise at a rate that we
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.260]   like.
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.620]   The big change that's happening right now, and that my producer Jesse, who's right over
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.820]   here holding the camera, is really taking the lead on, is we're bringing in more other
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.740]   people.
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.940]   We want live callers so that on the episodes you'll actually hear me going back and forth
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.420]   interacting with a listener who has a case study or a call and we want to do more interviews.
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.300]   So in general, happy about the way it's going.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.340]   We have some complexities.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.980]   Just like with writing, let me update you on how I actually schedule this work.
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.260]   So my rule for the podcast is the half day rule.
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.460]   One half day once a week.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.380]   That is what the show gets and we try to do as much as we can with that time.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.540]   So today, for example, is a podcast day.
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.300]   We finished recording episode 218 of the Deep Questions podcast not long ago.
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.980]   I arrived here around lunchtime and it's now, let me look at my clock here, 5 o'clock.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.620]   So this morning I could write and work on other things.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.060]   Half day.
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.720]   So it's a good challenge to figure out how much we can fit into a half day, how much
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   improvement we can do, but it also keeps the podcast from metastasizing over my whole schedule.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.500]   I might be slowing down the progress with the show by doing this, but it makes the schedule
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.780]   work.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.260]   So Deep Questions is the name of the podcast.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.420]   The same YouTube channel where you're seeing this video, you can see videos of each week's
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.460]   episode.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.700]   Also there's clips on this YouTube channel of popular questions and segments.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.360]   All right, final update, academic work.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.660]   So I'm not teaching this semester.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.740]   I'm on teaching leave, but I am a working computer scientist.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.500]   I do theory work on distributed algorithms.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.420]   I am working on, at this point, primarily one paper.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.420]   So I'm on my way to a conference two weeks after we record this where I'm actually presenting
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.780]   a paper I won an award for.
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.220]   I'm actually kind of proud of that.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.740]   But let me get tactical about how I'm trying to fit this research into the other things
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.780]   going on in my academic and writing life right now.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.560]   Because again, there's a bit of a pain point here.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.900]   My plan was the second shift rule.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.500]   Every day, deep work right away, right now that's my writing.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.220]   Every day at some point have what I call a second shift of deep work.
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.420]   And it doesn't matter if it's only 30 minutes long, but you're always touching base with
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.460]   something unrelated to the primary deep work every day.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.680]   So for me, it's going to be touching base with making progress on this academic paper,
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.300]   or it's typically doing some sort of research or thinking efforts for, let's say, like a
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.300]   New Yorker piece.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.080]   And to understand how this complex mechanism works, when one of these things in the second
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.800]   shift gets near completion, it then takes over the primary shift.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.520]   It's working okay.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.680]   But I would say in the last week or so, my success rate with the second shift doing the
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.680]   second shift is 50%.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.520]   All right, so that's what's going on.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.440]   What I want to do next is give you a look inside what I call my deep work HQ.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.740]   This is my secret deep thinking hideaway.
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.880]   It's in an office suite hidden above some stores on the main street of Tacoma Park,
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.880]   Maryland.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.280]   It's a few blocks from my house, so it's easy to get back and forth.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.440]   I've never actually shown this place to the public before, so this will be a first.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.240]   Let me warn you before we get started, it's halfway renovated.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:38.520]   All right, so the room we're in now is the main conference room of the deep work HQ.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.700]   It's where we just did our update.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.400]   I do work here.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.040]   Producer Jesse does work here.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.960]   I have computer science meetings here.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.440]   I'll get together with other professors when we work on papers.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.360]   There's some local writers in town who come for certain slots to come in here and write
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.760]   to get away from the noise at home.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.280]   Nerve center of the deep work HQ.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:07.240]   We have up on the wall here, these are actually proof sheets from our friends at Mouse Books.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.960]   Mouse Books is a company that sells these pocket-sized books.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.280]   The idea being don't pull out your smartphone when you're distracted, pull out a mouse book.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.400]   These are actually the sheets that go to the printer, the things that get printed to make
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.040]   the mouse books.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.760]   They sent us some.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.100]   We have some foreign copies of the books over here.
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.640]   These books I've written are in something like 45 different foreign markets we have
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.640]   deals with.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.800]   So you can find these books in a lot of places.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.520]   You can find deep work in Mongolia, for example.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.640]   I'll show you one little known flaw.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.120]   Maybe this is very valuable.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.480]   Here's the Russian edition of Digital Minimalism.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.560]   The first edition misspelled my name.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.840]   Call C-A-L-L Newport.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.440]   They fixed it in the second edition, but I appreciate the thoroughness here.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.960]   So this is now a collector's item, so I like to display that.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   It keeps me humble.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.600]   All right, so let me take you out of this main room and show you the rest.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.840]   One last thing to show you in the main room here is the whiteboard.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.120]   It's where a lot of work gets done.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.800]   This is actually from the last meeting I had with some of my computer science collaborators.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.760]   Believe it or not, this is pretty meaningful.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.680]   This is the beginnings of a paper that, if all goes well, will probably be submitting
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.720]   in February.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.120]   There's actually some work happening here.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.600]   The other side of this whiteboard actually has some business strategy, so I'm not going
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.600]   to show you that one.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:31.880]   All right, out here we have the main hallway of the HQ.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.880]   Display of my books.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.000]   We have the ego wall here.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.960]   This is a fan drew this for me.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.480]   This is actually exactly how I look.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.040]   I don't have my shirt on, so I think that's just good to know.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.600]   If you're not in shape, you can't think.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.440]   So we go down the hallway.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.640]   We have two rooms here.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:58.480]   This room is a mess, but it's going to be cool, so I'll just show it to you briefly.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:05.260]   So right now, we're storing a bunch of the old lights we used to use and a bunch of other
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.120]   books and boxes we haven't set up.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:13.520]   But just to give you the vision of this room, it is going to be the business office/maker
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.180]   lab.
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.240]   So me and my boys like to do DIY making, so here's our 3D printer.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.360]   We're bringing in a bunch of electronics and circuit gear.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.640]   So we're going to have one of the desks in here is going to be dedicated to building
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.000]   things.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.400]   The other desk will be just the business office for the HQ, where me and my producer Jesse
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.600]   can get the actual day-to-day work done.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.480]   So we've got a lot of work to do here, but we're excited about the possibilities.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.880]   Finally, I want to show you where the magic happens, where the Deep Questions podcast
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.400]   actually gets recorded.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.560]   Here is the studio.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.000]   This is where it happens.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.560]   You probably heard the sound get immediately flat as soon as I came in here.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.460]   It's the whole thing soundproof.
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.020]   So I sit here.
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.280]   Producer Jesse sits there.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.880]   We got our two cameras.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.460]   The lights, because this is such a small space, the lights are actually installed on the ceiling,
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.840]   so we get our fill, hair, and key lights without having to take up any floor space.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.400]   Mixing boards and sound processors.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:20.200]   Jesse runs the camera switchers right off of that control board there.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.900]   And the real magic to the show is the scripts.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:30.160]   So each time we record, we have 20, 30 pages of ads and questions and reads and notes.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.480]   That's the core of the podcast.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.000]   It takes us about two hours of prep work to get this ready each week, and everything goes
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.320]   off of there.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.240]   So that's a look inside my Deep Work HQ.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:46.920]   It is itself a work in progress, but I got to say, having a place to retreat to that's
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.160]   just for thinking about this type of ideas, just for being deep, away from the distractions
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.640]   at home, away from the distractions of my life as a professor, has really been one of
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.480]   the favorite things I've ever been able to do as a writer.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.880]   So anyways, I will keep you posted as we continue to update and improve this HQ, but I'm glad
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.420]   I had a chance to show you what's going on.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.680]   That's my update this week.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.120]   Be back next week, let you know what's happening in my life.
