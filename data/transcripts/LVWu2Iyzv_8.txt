[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960]   I would like to call your attention this evening to the first two verses in the sixth chapter
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.080]   of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.400]   The epistle to the Romans, chapter six, and the first two verses.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.680]   What shall we say then?
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.400]   Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.120]   God forbid!
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.320]   How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.320]   Now, you will remember that last Friday evening we spent most of our time in considering the
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.160]   connection of this statement and indeed of the whole of this sixth chapter and the seventh
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.800]   chapter.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.440]   We saw the vital importance of seeing exactly where they come in and how they come in in
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:02.320]   this great epistle as a kind of parenthesis between chapters five and chapter eight.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.560]   Then we also explained how it was exactly that this question, which is recorded in the
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.320]   first verse, could possibly have arisen.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.780]   Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.640]   We saw that there were certain things which the apostle had been saying in chapter five
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.640]   which could lead the unwary and the ignorant to ask such a question.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.600]   We saw the relevance of that to our preaching of the gospel.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.680]   Well now then, having dealt with that which is the content of verse one, we come to the
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.600]   second verse in which the apostle gives his answer, his response, his reaction.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.120]   Here is the possibility.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.720]   He may say, "Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?"
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.760]   God forbids, says the apostle, out upon the suggestion.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.200]   The thing is a sheer impossibility.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   It is unthinkable.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.280]   He does not know how to reject this very idea, but he does not just leave it as an exclamation
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.060]   of horror like that.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:21.020]   He goes on to give the reason for reacting in that way to the very suggestion of such
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.020]   a possibility.
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.820]   Here is his answer, his explanation.
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:34.100]   How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:43.420]   And thereby he shows the utterly unthinkable character of this suggestion.
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.860]   Well now here we therefore have one of these fundamental propositions of the apostle.
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.060]   I maintain that here in this answer which he gives in the second verse, he is really
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:03.060]   giving his complete answer which he then goes on to give in detail beginning at verse three
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.060]   and following.
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.380]   Now, in saying that, I know, I realize, I am aware of the fact that I am disagreeing
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.860]   with the renowned and redoubtable Charles Hodge in his commentary.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.580]   Charles Hodge feels that in verse two the apostle is just making a general statement,
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.620]   but that in verse three he begins with his argument.
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.940]   I say that I am dissenting from that entirely and suggesting rather that the apostle is
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.300]   giving his whole argument in chapter two, but then he proceeds to divide it up into
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.300]   parts.
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.660]   And my reason for that is that he puts it in this form, "No, ye not."
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.300]   In other words, he is now beginning to say, "Well, I've made my comprehensive statement.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.420]   Let me establish it.
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.900]   Let me prove it to you.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.180]   Let me demonstrate my contention."
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:04.340]   Not only that, I do trust that as we proceed we shall see that the whole of this section
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.300]   that we are looking at, which really runs down, as we saw, to the end of verse fourteen,
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.580]   all of that, in my opinion, is nothing but an extended commentary on this statement which
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.560]   he makes here in verse two.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.780]   The others are particular aspects of it, but here is the whole thing.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.780]   Now it is for me to prove my contention to you, and we do so by just proceeding with
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.780]   our exposition.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:43.300]   Now, here I am suggesting is one of those fundamental propositions of the apostle.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.620]   It is one of the most important statements, therefore, in the whole of the epistle.
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.740]   It is one of the most important statements of Christian doctrine that we can ever meet.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.100]   Now it is as important as this that the apostle goes on repeating it in various forms, in
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.740]   parts and portions, in almost every verse up to verse eight.
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.940]   Listen to what I mean.
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.580]   He says here, "How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?"
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.740]   Verse three, "Know we not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.380]   baptized into his death?"
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.140]   That is a part of it.
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.140]   Here is another.
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.500]   "Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like us Christ was raised
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.220]   up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.220]   life."
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.820]   Then verse five, "If we have been planted together in the likeness of his death."
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.260]   All these are variants of this statement in verse two.
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260]   Variants of it, emphasizing various aspects of it.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:54.060]   Verse six, "Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him."
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.980]   Verse eight, "Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him."
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.860]   There it is once more.
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:08.100]   And then in his exhortation in the eleventh verse, he says, "Likewise reckon ye also yourselves
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:14.100]   to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.100]   Now all those are variations on this one theme.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.780]   Sometimes parts of it, sometimes the whole of it.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:29.940]   So that clearly, it is something which in the mind of the apostle is very crucial and
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.940]   of the most vital importance to every one of us.
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:41.020]   Indeed I don't hesitate to say this, that to understand the meaning of this phrase is
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:48.020]   in one way the key to the understanding of the apostle's whole doctrine of salvation,
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.620]   in its full sense I mean.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.420]   Very well then, that means that we really must know exactly what it means and what it
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.700]   says.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:02.260]   We would be of necessity in trouble in all the verses that I've just read to you if
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260]   we are not clear about this verse.
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.780]   But if we are once clear about this, the others will follow comparatively easily and without
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.220]   much difficulty.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.340]   So we must really be clear about this.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.520]   What does it mean?
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.140]   We start with the little word "we."
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:26.340]   Now our authorized translation doesn't bring out the power and the force that the apostle
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.620]   put into this word as he did in the original.
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:35.340]   We read here, "How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer than him?"
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.460]   But what Paul wrote was this, "We?"
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.460]   How shall we?
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.660]   That's what it comes to.
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.540]   He starts with the word "we."
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.420]   He puts emphasis upon it.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.420]   It's very vital.
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.420]   Why?
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.420]   Well, it means this.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:08:00.780]   What he is really saying is this, "We, being what we are, how is it possible or conceivable
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.100]   that we should continue in sin that grace may abound?"
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:12.300]   We, being such as we are, can we, who are dead to sin, live any longer than him?
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.060]   Now that's the emphasis.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:19.660]   And of course at once we are given the key to the interpretation.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:28.960]   The whole emphasis, you see, is on this, our uniqueness, our special position.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.060]   We being what we are.
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.820]   That's the thing that the apostle says is so unthinkable.
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:40.220]   He says if you truly realize who you are and what your position is, well, this question
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:45.820]   that's been raised in the first verse automatically goes out of court.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.620]   So that really the trouble with people is, who don't understand this doctrine, that
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.660]   they don't realize who and what they are.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.860]   They don't realize their position.
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:04.060]   We being what we are and who we are, can such people live any longer in sin?
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.140]   Now that's the force of the argument.
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:12.020]   So that it is tremendously important that we should realize the force that he puts into
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.820]   this little word "we."
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.180]   In other words, what he's saying is this, that people who raise the kind of question
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:25.260]   that he's put in the first verse are simply people who have not been able to follow his
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.020]   argument in chapter 5, verse 12 to verse 21.
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:35.380]   If only they'd followed that and realized who they are and where they are and what they
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.060]   are in the light of that doctrine.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:45.620]   Well then, they'd realize how utterly monstrous and ridiculous it is to put such a question.
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.860]   Right, there's the first part of it.
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:53.700]   And indeed, as I say, the very prominence he gives to the word "we" virtually tells
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.060]   us the whole thing.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:00.820]   Fortunately, however, he goes on and he puts it a little more fully.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:11.460]   We being what we are, we that are dead to sin, how shall we live any longer then?
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:16.020]   Well now then, this brings us to what I called at the end last Friday night, the key statement,
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:26.180]   the key phrase about "we that are dead to sin."
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:31.720]   And this is the phrase that keeps on recurring, you see, in various forms.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.500]   So we must be quite clear about it.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:42.060]   Now I did remind you very hurriedly at the end that the translation here again is unfortunate.
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:49.860]   This authorized version has "we that are dead to sin," but it isn't that.
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:57.300]   It isn't "we that are dead to sin," it isn't "we that have died to sin," it is "we that
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.060]   died to sin."
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:04.020]   And you see at once the difference.
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:09.060]   If you read it as "we that are dead to sin," you might say, well, it's a description of
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.540]   our present state and condition.
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.540]   We are now dead to sin.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.540]   That's our present state and condition.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.500]   But the Apostle wasn't anxious to say that.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:26.020]   Neither does he say "we that have died to sin," because there again it might suggest
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:31.740]   a process, that once we were very much alive to sin, but that gradually we became more
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.220]   and more dead to it, until now we've reached a point at which we can say that after all
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:41.140]   our effort and struggle and endeavor, we have died to sin.
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.140]   But the Apostle didn't say either.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:54.580]   He used the aorist tense, and the aorist tense always points to a fact or an act that has
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:59.460]   happened once, so that we must translate it.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.420]   And everybody's really agreed about this.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.260]   That's why this authorized translation is most unfortunate at this point.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:12.700]   He's agreed that it should be "how shall we that died to sin?"
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:19.340]   It is pointing back to something in the past, a fact, an act, an event which happened once.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:23.220]   It took place completely, not a process.
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.220]   So he's not describing a process.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.220]   He's not describing a present position or condition.
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:36.020]   He is describing something that has happened to us as a fact, as an act in our past experience.
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.220]   Now that is, of course, of crucial importance.
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.620]   And it's as crucial as this that we shall find that he uses the same tense exactly in
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:50.740]   verses 6 and 7 and 8 and 10 and 11.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.100]   And I shall have to keep on recurring to this and bringing out this same point with the
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:00.860]   same emphasis, that in all those instances it is in the aorist tense.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:01.860]   Right.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.980]   Well, now then, here's our translation.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:12.260]   "We, how shall we that died to sin, live any longer therein?"
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.820]   What does it mean?
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:14.820]   What is he saying?
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:21.900]   Well, now, here again I've got to put certain possibilities before you, because commentators
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:32.100]   and others have from time to time put forward various explanations and answers to the question.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:38.700]   There are some who have not hesitated to say that this means just this, that as Christians
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:48.140]   we are dead completely to the influence, to the power, and to the love of sin.
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.420]   They are what you call perfectionists.
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:57.220]   They say that they have completely finished with sin in that sense, that they're entirely
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:02.380]   dead to its influence, to its power, and to the love of sin.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:07.820]   Well, we needn't stay with this, because there is only one real answer to give to it,
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.940]   and that is that it isn't true.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.980]   It isn't true.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.300]   There is no such person.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.580]   There never has been.
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:24.860]   Not only that, the whole of the subsequent argument of the apostle makes that explanation
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.860]   impossible.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:31.380]   If that were true, well, then he would never have written verses 11, 12, and 13, "Likewise
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:36.300]   reckon ye yourselves also to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.620]   Christ our Lord."
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.980]   He would never have written, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body."
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:49.060]   You needn't say that to a man who is completely dead to all the power and the influence and
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.060]   all the love of sin.
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:59.300]   No, no, it just makes the apostle's subsequent exposition and appeal and exhortation quite
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.980]   oceanous and indeed almost ridiculous.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.100]   So we reject that immediately.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:12.500]   But then there are others who say that it means this, that the apostle really means
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.060]   that we ought to be dead to sin.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.020]   They say he's not saying we are, because that's perfectionism.
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.100]   But what he really is saying is that if we were Christians worthy of the name and really
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:28.380]   had understanding that as Christians we ought to be dead to sin, how can you who ought to
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.660]   be dead to sin live any longer therein?
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:35.060]   Well, there is only one answer to that.
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.740]   The apostle does not say that we ought to be dead to sin.
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.860]   He says in the Aorist tense that we died to sin.
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.260]   There's no ought here.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.380]   He's not telling us what we ought to be.
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.900]   He is reminding us of something that is true of us.
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:55.500]   So out goes of necessity this suggestion that it means that we ought to be dead to sin.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:00.140]   The very tense he uses makes that beyond any doubt.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:06.580]   Then there are others who say that it means how shall we that are dying more and more
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:11.140]   to sin live any longer therein?
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:16.820]   How can we say who are dying more and more to sin, shall we continue in sin that grace
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.820]   may abound?
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.660]   They say it would be self-contradictory.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.660]   It is ridiculous.
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.700]   Well, again, there's only one answer.
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:31.820]   The apostle does not say that in the continuous present we are dying more and more unto sin.
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.940]   The people who put that explanation forward, you see, took this authorized translation
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.480]   instead of realizing that it was the Aorist.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.500]   We are not dying more and more unto sin.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.500]   That isn't what Paul says.
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.220]   He says you've died unto sin.
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:51.280]   We died unto sin in that act, in that fact, in that event in the past.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:57.300]   So we reject those three possible expositions.
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.660]   And now we come to another.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:08.500]   And again I confess freely that I'm unhappy because once more I venture and have to express
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.700]   a criticism of the great Charles Hodge.
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.400]   No one does that lightly.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.420]   But we are reminded that no man is infallible.
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.180]   We don't believe in popes, do we?
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.180]   Very well.
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:29.540]   Well, even Charles Hodge is not infallible, and I am not infallible.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:37.980]   So we are entitled to examine the exposition of any man, however great and however mighty
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.900]   he may have been.
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.060]   Now Charles Hodge tells us that it means this.
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:54.820]   He says, "How shall we that have renounced sin live any longer therein?"
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.580]   You see, that's his way of putting it.
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.220]   What he's saying is this.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:05.020]   He says, "Now a man who's a Christian, by the very fact that he claims to be a Christian,
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:10.420]   is a man who is saying that he has renounced sin.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.300]   Why does he say that he believes in the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:17.860]   He does so because he has come to realize that he is a sinner, and that that would lead
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.300]   to punishment, eternal punishment.
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.760]   Therefore he feels the need of being delivered.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.420]   He believes the gospel concerning the Lord Jesus Christ as one who can deliver him from
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.420]   sin.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.420]   Therefore when he says, "I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ," says Hodge, he's a man
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.620]   who is saying, "I want to be delivered from sin.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:41.140]   It's because I've come to see what a terrible thing sin is that I want to be delivered from
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.140]   it.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.140]   I renounce it and all its ways."
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:50.220]   Well then, says Hodge, if a man has said that, if he's renounced sin, how can he possibly
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.540]   say, "Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?"
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.820]   He's contradicting himself.
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:02.100]   He's claiming at one moment that he wants to be rid of sin, but then he says, "Oh, well
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.940]   this wonderful grace allows me to continue in sin."
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:10.900]   And he's contradicting himself, says Charles Hodge.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.820]   Why then do I not accept his interpretation?
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.460]   I reject it for this reason.
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:24.500]   First and foremost, I feel he's not giving due weight to this "we."
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.380]   He's not giving sufficient emphasis to the uniqueness of our position.
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:33.100]   That is, according to Paul, the thing that makes this suggestion impossible and unthinkable.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:39.780]   We being what we are, not something that we've done, but our being what we are, that's the
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.300]   thing.
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:46.140]   Of course when a man claims to believe in Christ, he renounces sin, but that isn't what
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.780]   the apostle is saying here.
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.380]   He's not talking about something that we do.
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.500]   He's telling us about something that's happened to us.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:59.460]   He doesn't say here that we've renounced sin, he says we died to sin.
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:05.980]   Now then, I therefore feel that it is essential that we should reject his exposition and indeed
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:15.700]   almost go further and say this, that at that point Charles Hodge is almost saying something
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.580]   which seems to me to be very near a direct contradiction of the whole of the apostle's
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.020]   argument in this section.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.420]   Charles Hodge leaves it all with us.
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.140]   We have renounced sin.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:30.780]   When we submitted to baptism, he says, that Paul was saying that to these Romans, when
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.220]   you submitted to baptism, when you came forward as candidates to baptism, what were you doing?
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.380]   Well, you were saying, "I want to finish with that old life of sin.
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.380]   That's why I ask for baptism.
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.620]   I want to be dead to it.
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.940]   I want to have no more to do with it.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.540]   I renounce it."
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:53.620]   He puts all the emphasis on us, on our activity, on our action, on what we are doing.
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:21:02.140]   Whereas I hope I can show you that the apostle's emphasis is on what has been done to us, on
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.260]   our position, our status.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.940]   Not what we've done, but what has been done to us, this great thing that he's been talking
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:14.260]   about in chapter 5, verses 12 to the end.
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:20.180]   I think I understand why Charles Hodge puts forward this interpretation.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:25.220]   Charles Hodge, I think, was afraid that if he interpreted it as I'm proposing to do tonight,
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.060]   that he'd be too exposed to the charge of antinomianism.
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.780]   But as I pointed out last Friday, if we don't interpret this in such a way as to expose
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:39.180]   us to the charge of antinomianism, we're not expounding it correctly.
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:43.900]   So we must be very careful that we do not allow a spirit of fear to come in, which stands
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.380]   between us, and an exposition of the truth.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:52.580]   So I reject that explanation.
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:59.980]   And then, if I may borrow a statement once made by King David to his wife, Michael, let
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.820]   me be yet more vile.
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:09.060]   I've even on this occasion got to disagree somewhat with Robert Halden also.
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:16.380]   It's no small thing to disagree with these two giants in one evening.
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.900]   How does Robert Halden expound this?
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:25.700]   Well, this is Halden's exposition.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:33.700]   Halden sees clearly that the kind of idea put forward by Hodge is obviously inadequate,
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:39.740]   as he rejects the other expositions that I have rejected.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:45.020]   He can see that that isn't enough, that Paul is not talking about something that we are
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.540]   doing, but something that's happened to us.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.780]   He realizes that there is a very real death to sin here.
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.620]   The apostle says, "We died to sin."
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.860]   Very well, says Halden, very rightly.
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.860]   There is some sense in which we must have died to sin.
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.860]   What is it?
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.140]   And then he says this.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:07.740]   The apostle means, he says, that we have died to the guilt of sin.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.340]   And he stops at that.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.900]   We have died to the guilt of sin.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:18.620]   What he means, says Halden, is that as far as the guilt and punishment of sin are concerned,
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.820]   we're finished.
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.700]   The law can't touch us.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.300]   He puts it, if you like, in terms of Augustus' top lady, "The terrors of law and of God with
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.020]   me can have nothing to do.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:33.820]   My Savior's obedience and blood hide all my transgressions from view."
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.260]   We are dead as far as the guilt of sin is concerned.
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.860]   It can't touch us.
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:44.060]   There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.060]   And he stops there.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:51.660]   Well, of course, I agree entirely that it does mean that we are dead to the guilt of
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:59.140]   sin, but I feel that that's a hopelessly inadequate exposition to stop at that.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.540]   It goes beyond that.
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:06.140]   The apostle's argument goes almost infinitely beyond that.
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:12.820]   I feel that I have to turn down Halden's exposition for this reason.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:16.820]   That he doesn't do justice to what the apostle has been saying at the end of chapter 5.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:21.980]   Neither does he do justice to what Paul is going on to say in this sixth chapter, verses
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.580]   3 and following.
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.980]   What was it, you think, that controlled the exposition of Halden?
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.500]   I have no doubt it is the same thing again.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.100]   It is the fear of antinomianism.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.700]   It is the fear of being misunderstood.
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.100]   It is the fear of saying something that might lead people to say, "Very well, if that is
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.100]   so.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.100]   It doesn't matter what I do.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.100]   I'm saved, all right."
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.220]   So he confines it to the guilt of sin only.
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.140]   He says the power of sin is still there, and the apostle does not say that we are dead
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.140]   to that.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:56.620]   But I want to go on and to suggest that the apostle does say that.
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:02.460]   And that the true interpretation, as I see it and to which I now come, does not stop
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:06.980]   merely at saying that we are dead to the guilt of sin.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:11.260]   I believe here the apostle is saying something that is infinitely bigger and more thrilling
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.260]   than that.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.260]   Astounding.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:17.620]   And yet it shouldn't astound us who have been following this exposition so far.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:18.620]   What am I suggesting?
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:26.940]   I'm suggesting this, that if we only allow the context to determine our exposition, there
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:30.620]   is no problem here at all.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:37.700]   In what sense has the believer, the Christian, died to sin?
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:48.420]   The answer is in verse 21 of chapter 5, that "as sin reigned unto death, even so might
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:57.460]   grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.980]   In what sense have I, as a Christian, died to sin?
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:06.980]   I answer, I have died to the reign of sin.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.500]   Not only to the guilt of sin, I have died to the reign of sin.
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.940]   That's the whole point the apostle is making.
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:20.100]   He's contrasting the reign of sin with the reign of grace.
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:27.860]   And what he has been saying is this, that our Lord's death and resurrection has brought
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:34.300]   the reign of sin to an end in the case of all believers.
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.260]   That's what he means by saying this.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.340]   Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.380]   He's been working it out in detail.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:46.260]   As by the offense of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, that's the reign
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.460]   of sin.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:52.020]   Even so, by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men to justification
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.020]   of life.
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.060]   That's the reign of grace.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:00.540]   For as by one man's disobedience all were made sinners, that's the reign of grace.
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.540]   That's the reign of sin.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:08.820]   So, by the obedience of one, shall many be made righteous, that's the reign of grace.
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.820]   But he's been putting it in detail, don't you remember?
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:18.700]   He says, "For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more they which receive
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:25.460]   abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ."
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.140]   Indeed he said it all in the 12th verse.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:35.820]   "Wherefore, as by one man's sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.220]   passed upon all men, for that all have sinned."
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.220]   That's the reign of sin.
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:46.220]   But his whole point is just to say this, that if you're a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:52.020]   if you're justified by faith, if you're in Christ, well, you're finished with that.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.180]   You are dead to the reign of sin.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.820]   You're under the reign of grace.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.180]   And that's what he's saying here.
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:07.220]   So he says, "How shall we that died to sin, that died to the reign of sin, live any longer
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.220]   therein?"
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:18.940]   Now, don't forget this, that the reign of sin means its rule, its power, its realm.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:23.400]   We spent time in expounding it back in last May.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.180]   And the reign of grace means exactly the same.
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:34.820]   It means the power, the influence, the force, the might, the dynamic, and all the rest of
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:35.820]   it.
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:43.980]   But here, what the apostle is saying is this, that at the moment when we were regenerate,
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:52.700]   at the moment, if you like, of our justification, because then it becomes actual in our experience,
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:29:03.220]   the moment we become Christians, we are dead, completely dead to the reign of sin.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.860]   We are out of that territory altogether.
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:10.860]   Now that, I am suggesting to you, is what the apostle is saying in this second verse.
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:16.300]   In the following verses, he works out all that and explains all that in detail.
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.200]   He shows us how it happens.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.940]   But here, we have the general statement and proposition only, that because we are what
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:32.580]   we are in Christ, being what we are as a result of what has happened to us, we are completely
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:37.460]   dead to the reign and to the rule of sin.
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:43.660]   But now I imagine somebody putting forward an objection.
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:48.180]   How can you possibly say such a thing?
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.340]   We still sin.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:58.140]   We still feel the power of temptation and the power of sin.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:04.740]   How can you say, therefore, honestly, that you are dead to the rule and to the reign
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:09.780]   and to the whole dominion of sin?
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.800]   I answer in this way.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:24.780]   We must differentiate between what is true of our position as a fact and our experience.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:30.340]   There is all the difference in the world between a man's status and position and his exact
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.340]   experience.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:40.380]   Now, here, the apostle is concerned primarily about our position.
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.460]   And what he says is this.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:51.300]   Every person in the world at this minute is either under the reign and the rule of sin
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:57.220]   or else under the reign and rule of grace.
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.540]   And what he says about the Christian is, "You were once under the rule and reign of sin.
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:07.220]   You are now under the rule and reign of grace."
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.820]   It's either one or the other.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.020]   You can't have a foot in each position.
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:17.820]   You are either under sin or else you are under grace.
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:22.180]   And what he says about us as Christians, I repeat, is that we are dead completely to
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:25.780]   the rule and the reign of sin and of evil.
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.740]   We are dead to that.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.620]   That is no longer true of us.
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.380]   Once and forever we have been taken out of that.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:37.760]   Now then, let me substantiate my exposition by quoting to you parallel statements which
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.820]   are found elsewhere in the Scripture.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:48.140]   Bear in mind what I am proving, that the apostle is saying here that we have been taken entirely
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:54.340]   out of the realm and the rule and the reign and the kingdom of sin and have been put into
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.380]   this other kingdom of grace and its reign.
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.820]   Listen to Colossians 1.13.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:11.700]   "Who has delivered us from the power of darkness"—notice what he says—"who has delivered us from
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:22.340]   the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son."
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:27.060]   The apostle is there telling these Colossians that they who once belonged to the power of
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:34.860]   the kingdom of darkness and of the devil and of hell have been translated, transferred.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.860]   They are no longer in that dominion, they are in this dominion.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:42.940]   That is what he is saying, "translated."
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:48.420]   It is not surprising that the apostle Paul keeps on saying things like this.
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:52.460]   Wasn't this the very commission that our Lord gave him when he met him on the road to Damascus?
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:57.340]   Let me read to you Acts 26, verse 18.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:02.140]   The risen Lord gives his commission to the apostle as a disciple and a preacher.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.380]   What is he to do?
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:11.940]   He says to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:17.140]   of Satan unto God.
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:22.980]   The people you are going to preach to, says our Lord to Paul, are under the power of Satan.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.700]   He is the strong man armed to keep his goods at peace.
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.260]   They are in his kingdom, they are under his power.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.420]   He is tyrannizing, he is reigning over them.
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:38.820]   I am sending you with this message that you may deliver them from the power of Satan unto
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.340]   the power of God.
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:46.020]   There is a transference, there is a translation, there is a moving.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:51.780]   And then you see in the same way the apostle in Philippians 3, verse 20, says this about
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.100]   Christians.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:34:01.660]   He says our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.460]   That is Philippians 3, verse 20.
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:06.540]   He does not say our citizenship is going to be there.
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:11.260]   He says our citizenship is in heaven now.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.580]   We are living on earth but our citizenship is there.
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:18.180]   But you say how can a man say our citizenship is in heaven when we are still on earth and
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.860]   we are a citizen of Great Britain?
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.980]   Now that is the sort of thing the scripture says, you see.
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:29.140]   That you really are now, if you are a Christian, a citizen of heaven.
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.380]   We are a colony of heaven in this world.
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:34.540]   Our citizenship is there, not here.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:38.300]   This transference of citizenship has taken place.
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.300]   He says it everywhere.
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.140]   You remember in Ephesians 2, exactly the same thing.
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:47.820]   "Ye are no more strangers than foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and of
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.220]   the household of God."
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:52.860]   Again the same transference.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:35:00.100]   In other words, there has been a complete change in our position.
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:06.020]   We have changed our kingdoms once and forever.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.700]   We are no longer in the territory of sin.
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:13.660]   We are no longer under the governing power of sin.
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.980]   Sin no longer controls us.
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.460]   Sin no longer controls our destiny.
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:32.300]   Or if you like it in other terms, before becoming Christians we were united to Adam.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.900]   We belong to Adam and his fallen race.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.100]   And all the consequences of his sin and action have come upon us.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:42.220]   We were in Adam.
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.460]   But we are no longer in Adam.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.220]   We are in Christ.
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.180]   We have been taken out of Adam.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.980]   We have been put into Christ.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:58.020]   Now I say again, there are only two possibilities for every person alive in this world tonight.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.460]   You are either in Adam or else you are in Christ.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:08.380]   Surely that is the whole argument of Romans 5, 12 to 21.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:13.140]   These are the only two men and we are in one or the other and you cannot be in both at
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.140]   the same time.
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.380]   If you are in Christ you are not in Adam.
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.300]   That is what he is saying here.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:24.020]   We are dead to sin, dead to the territory, dead to the rule and to the reign.
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:29.060]   But I cannot even stop there.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.980]   That is all negative.
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.260]   And it is absolutely true.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:41.580]   But I must become positive because I think the Apostle's statement is positive also.
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:50.900]   We are not only dead to the reign of sin, we are under the reign of grace and all that
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:56.140]   that means in terms of power.
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:00.580]   In other words, what the Apostle is telling us here is this, that we are not merely forgiven.
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.500]   It is not merely that our sins have been forgiven.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:07.860]   A Christian is not only a man whose sins have been forgiven and who has decided to live
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:12.140]   a better life and who is anxious to live a better life.
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.980]   More must be said of him.
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:20.460]   He has been transferred to the reign of grace.
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:24.740]   And the reign of grace is a very powerful reign.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:32.260]   And it is as powerful as this as the Apostle, that it is guaranteed to produce certain results.
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:35.260]   Now the reign of sin produced results.
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:38.580]   The reign of sin caused death to pass upon every one of us.
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:40.140]   It caused us all to sin.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:43.980]   The reign of sin is a very powerful thing and it got us all down.
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.300]   But the reign of grace, as Paul says, is infinitely more powerful.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:51.260]   Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:57.020]   If the power of sin in its kingdom guarantees certain results, the reign of grace guarantees
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:01.900]   certain results still more certainly.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:02.900]   And what is guaranteed?
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:14.820]   Well, what is guaranteed is this, that my full and final salvation is absolutely certain.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.700]   I am not merely dead to the reign of sin.
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:22.460]   I am alive under the reign of grace.
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:26.260]   And grace, my dear friends, is a tremendous power.
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.940]   You mustn't think of yourself as a Christian, as just a man who has decided something and
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.300]   wants to do this and that.
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.300]   No, no.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:37.260]   As a Christian, what it means is this, that all the dynamic of the reign of grace is upon
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:41.860]   you and is working in you and will bring you to perfection.
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.260]   That's the reign of grace.
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:49.020]   It's the certainty that the apostle is anxious to bring out.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:54.660]   And that is why this suggestion in the first verse is so monstrous.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.420]   Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:02.500]   The whole object of grace is to destroy sin and all its work and all that belongs to it.
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.860]   So it's impossible.
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.740]   We are under this power that is destroying that.
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.620]   How can we continue in that, therefore?
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.620]   You see the argument?
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.620]   Now, it is inevitable, isn't it?
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:17.060]   But none of the other suggestions made it inevitable.
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:18.620]   This is how he is putting it.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:30.620]   We, being what we are, dead to Adam and dead to sin and its reign and its rule, how can
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:35.860]   we, he says, that die to sin, live any longer therein?
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.140]   Now, the word live is important, isn't it?
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:43.500]   It means continue and abide.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.100]   What the apostle is saying here, that in view of our position, the fact that we are under
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:54.060]   the rule and reign of grace, it is impossible that we should continue and abide in sin or
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:40:00.660]   that a life of sin should be our life.
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:05.260]   And you notice that this is doctrine not confined to the apostle Paul.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.980]   I read those two sections of Scripture to you at the beginning in order to show you
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:13.780]   that our Lord himself had said it all and that John says exactly the same thing in his
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:16.980]   first epistle in chapter 3.
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.260]   Did you notice how our Lord put it?
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:25.060]   Look here, he said, "He that commiteth sin," and he means by "committed" that goes on,
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.180]   that lives in that realm, he's the servant of sin, "and the servant shall not abide in
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:33.820]   the house forever, but the Son abideth ever."
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:43.300]   And then, this is the thing, "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.700]   free indeed."
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.300]   It's an absolute freedom where the Son is concerned.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:55.060]   Well, then, listen to John in the first epistle, chapter 3, verse 9, "Whosoever is born of
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:41:05.580]   God doth not commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:06.580]   of God."
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.580]   Now, there's a great verse, isn't it?
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.060]   And how often have people argued about it.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.220]   It says, "What's he saying?
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:14.940]   He that is born of God doth not commit sin."
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:18.580]   Some people say that's absolute perfection, and you can reach perfection in this life
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:23.100]   in which you don't sin at all, to which there is but one reply, "It isn't true again."
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.540]   Well, what does he mean then?
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.060]   Well, it's this word "commit," you see.
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:30.320]   It means "practice habitually."
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:35.100]   It means "continue in it, live in it," that that's your life.
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.460]   That's what John is saying is impossible.
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:41.340]   Whosoever is born of God does not go on living a life of sin.
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:46.540]   He doesn't practice it habitually, "for his seed remaineth in him," and he cannot go on
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:51.260]   like that, because he is born of God.
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.100]   He isn't saying that a man who is born of God can never commit an individual sin, because
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.180]   if he said that, there would never have been a Christian at all, and there wouldn't be
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:59.660]   a Christian now.
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:06.780]   What he's saying is that the man who is born of God cannot go on abiding in that realm
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:07.780]   of sin.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:12.540]   In other words, he's agreeing with Paul that the man who is a Christian died to the realm
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:16.300]   of sin, that he doesn't belong to it any longer.
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:20.660]   And you notice the word he uses, he keeps on using the word "cannot."
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:25.020]   He cannot, says John, and Paul is using the same "cannot" here.
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:34.260]   That's why he's scouting the suggestion with "God forbid, how can we that die to sin live
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:37.380]   any longer therein?"
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:46.980]   You see, in other words, the argument is this, that this is impossible, because the man who
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:54.700]   is a Christian is under the power of grace.
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:43:01.940]   Not only is he out of the power of sin and the realm of sin, he is under the influence
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:09.020]   and the power and is in the realm of this mighty force which Paul personalizes and calls
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.740]   grace and its reign.
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:18.180]   And because he's under this, he cannot continue where he was before.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:23.220]   Grace makes it impossible, and so he puts it in verse 14 at the end of the section in
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:30.900]   these triumphant words, "Sin shall not have dominion over you."
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:31.900]   It shall not have it.
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.540]   Let it do its worst.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.340]   It shall not have dominion over you.
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.340]   Why?
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:39.100]   Well, because grace is infinitely more powerful.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:43.700]   Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:47.740]   And that's what he's telling us already in this second verse.
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.940]   The apostle is not merely telling us that we ought not to sin.
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:56.300]   He's not merely saying that we ought not to continue in sin.
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:01.220]   He's not saying that it is self-contradictory of us, as Charles Hodge puts it, if we do
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:04.340]   go on sinning in view of the fact that we've renounced sin.
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.620]   What he's saying is this.
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:15.340]   You cannot, you cannot, you shall not go on living in the realm and under that final power
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:16.340]   of sin.
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.340]   Why?
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:22.980]   Well, for the reason that is already given in verse 16 of the first chapter, "I am not
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.940]   ashamed of the gospel of Christ."
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:25.940]   Why?
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:33.900]   It is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth.
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:37.940]   And that's his whole argument in these chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8.
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:42.420]   That the moment a man has been justified by God, what God has been saying is this.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:46.940]   Look here, I am going to deliver you completely from that power.
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:51.700]   I'll start at once by taking you out of its realm and its kingdom and putting you into
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:57.340]   the kingdom of my dear Son, and then progressively I'll deliver you completely until finally
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:04.140]   you're perfect and without blemish or spot or wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.540]   That's what he's saying.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:14.060]   We die to the reign and the realm and the rule of sin.
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.540]   But wait a minute, says someone.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:19.420]   I still got a final objection, and here it is.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:25.380]   If that is true, if it's true as you've been emphasizing so much, that in Christ we are
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:32.660]   rarely dead and finished with the rule and the reign of sin once and forever, how is
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:36.340]   it then that we still can fall into sin?
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:41.180]   And why does the apostle have to exhort us to reckon ourselves to be dead and to sin,
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:48.660]   and not to allow sin to reign in our mortal body and things like that?
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:52.260]   How do you answer it?
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.580]   The answer is quite simple.
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:57.700]   The apostle is not saying that we are sinless.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.840]   Is that clear?
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:07.220]   He is not saying that we are sinless, but he is saying that we are out of the territory,
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:14.700]   out of the kingdom, out of the realm, out of the rule and the reign of sin.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:20.900]   There is all the difference in the world between being in the position and realizing that you
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:21.900]   are in that position.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:25.100]   Shall I give you an illustration or two?
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:28.900]   Take those poor slaves in the United States of America.
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.020]   There they were in the condition of slavery.
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:37.620]   Then comes the American Civil War, and as a result of that war, slavery is abolished,
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:40.140]   as it had previously been abolished in the British Empire.
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.820]   Yes, but what happened?
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:46.100]   Well, there were many poor slaves, some of the older ones particularly, who had been
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.700]   slaves all their lives.
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:54.460]   They heard the announcement that slavery was abolished, but hundreds, not to say thousands,
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:47:00.020]   of times in their lives and their experiences, many of them forgot it, many of them didn't
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.020]   realize it.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:04.820]   And when they saw their old master coming, they began to quake and to tremble, and wondered
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:05.820]   whether they were going to be sold.
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.860]   They had forgotten that they had been set free.
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.820]   They were free.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.220]   They were no longer slaves.
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:13.980]   The law had been changed.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:18.220]   Their status and their position was absolutely different.
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:21.380]   But it took them a very long time to realize it.
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:26.940]   You see, you can still be a slave experimentally, whereas you are no longer a slave legally.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:31.300]   You can be a slave in your feelings, when actually in your position, you have been emancipated
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:33.020]   completely.
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.620]   And so it is with the Christians.
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:39.900]   Or I could even put it like this, perhaps.
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:45.420]   Only a child is afraid of a servant, a servant employed by his father to help him and to
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:46.420]   look after him.
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:47.420]   The child is afraid.
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.420]   He shouldn't be.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:52.700]   If the child only realized that he is a child, he wouldn't be afraid of the servant in that
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.700]   way.
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:55.540]   But he doesn't realize it.
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:01.340]   He hasn't got a sufficiently active or live realization of his position as a son, and
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.780]   he is afraid of a servant, though he is above the servant.
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:07.060]   It's like that.
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:12.380]   Or may I use an illustration that I once used from this pulpit on a Sunday years ago, which
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:16.260]   has helped me and I found in my pastoral work has helped many another.
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.740]   Here is the problem.
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:23.700]   How can you say that I am entirely delivered from the rule and the realm and the reign
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:28.300]   of the devil and of sin, and still I fall to temptation?
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:32.660]   Well I put it like this.
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:40.020]   Between a field here, and here is a road, and there is another field, there are two
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.900]   fields with a road between them.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:53.060]   This field is the dominion, the kingdom, the territory, the empire of sin and of Satan,
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.340]   and that is where we all were.
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:49:02.020]   But as the result of the work of the Lord Jesus Christ upon us through the Holy Spirit,
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:09.060]   we have been taken hold of from there and transferred here, translated from the power
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:12.660]   of darkness into the kingdom of his dear Son.
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:16.220]   I was there, I am now here.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:20.500]   Very well, here I am now in this new territory on this side of the road.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:27.700]   Yes, but I spent many a long year there, and the devil is still there, and all his powers
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:32.060]   and his forces are still there, and this is what happens, you see.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:37.220]   Though I am here and he can't touch me, do you remember John's first epistle again, chapter
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.940]   five, the evil one, he says, "Toucheth us not."
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:40.940]   He can't touch us.
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.900]   We are no longer in his kingdom, we are in this kingdom.
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:53.300]   I know he can't touch us, but he can shout across the road, can't he?
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:54.300]   Exactly.
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.300]   Exactly.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:50:00.020]   And as you laughed now, you laughed at yourself.
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:03.620]   Every Christian who falls into sin is a fool.
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:08.100]   And if I have only persuaded you tonight to laugh at yourself, as every time you sin,
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:11.560]   "Oh, I have achieved everything I set out to do."
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:13.780]   That is precisely the position.
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.740]   He cannot touch us.
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.880]   Why do we then listen to him?
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.700]   Why do we allow him to frighten us?
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:23.220]   Why do we pay any attention to him?
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:24.440]   We don't belong to him.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.900]   He cannot touch us.
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:33.000]   I know he cannot, you see, as an actual fact, but because of the old habit, the old influence,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.400]   we are like that slave that had been set free.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:40.340]   We tend to forget it, and he speaks and we listen, and we fall under the spell.
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:44.660]   We could resist him, resist the devil and he'll flee from you.
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.660]   But you see, we don't realize it.
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:50.380]   And the whole of the object of the apostle in this sixth chapter is just to get us to
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:54.980]   realize it, "Reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin."
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:55.980]   You are.
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:56.980]   Realize it.
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:57.980]   Reckon it.
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:03.380]   "And alive unto God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:08.300]   It isn't true yet, perhaps, in your experience, but though it isn't true in your experience,
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:12.740]   it is true as a matter of fact.
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:17.300]   And we've got to believe it, and that's why the apostle writes like this.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.140]   This isn't a matter of experience.
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.740]   He's dealing with a matter of fact.
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:27.780]   He says you died to sin as a matter of actual historical fact.
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:32.580]   When you became a Christian, you ceased to be under the rule and the reign and the realm
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:33.580]   of sin.
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:34.580]   It's a fact.
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:37.580]   He's not talking about your experience.
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:42.620]   He's telling you something that's true of you, that you've been translated by the Holy
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.620]   Spirit from there to here.
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:51.900]   But I can't believe that, says somebody, it's too staggering.
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:52.900]   It's almost incredible.
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:57.580]   Here am I on earth, and I listen to that voice, and I fall into sin, and yet you're telling
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.100]   me I am dead to it.
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:00.460]   I am.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:01.780]   And I'm asking you to believe it.
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:03.380]   I know it's staggering.
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.900]   But you know, the apostle has already dealt with your difficulty.
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:11.580]   In chapter 4, do you remember what he said there about Abram?
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:16.460]   When he'd wound up his great argument about justification by faith only?
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.780]   He says, "Become children of Abram.
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:19.780]   Do what Abram did."
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:24.140]   There he was, an old man aged ninety-nine, and Sarah over ninety.
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:27.740]   And God came to him and said, "Abram, I'm going to give you a child.
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:29.580]   You're going to have a son.
[00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:31.140]   You're heir, the heir of promise."
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:38.700]   Ninety-nine, and Sarah ninety, the deadness of Sarah's womb, contrary to nature.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.780]   I know, say what you like.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:41.780]   God said it to Abram.
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:42.780]   It seemed impossible.
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:44.140]   It seemed monstrous.
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:47.140]   It seemed utterly ridiculous.
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:56.780]   But Abram staggered not through unbelief, but was made strong by faith.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:53:02.100]   He believed the bare Word of God.
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:05.140]   He believed it simply because God said it.
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:08.180]   And you and I have to do the same here.
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:14.700]   Whatever you may feel, whatever your experience may be, God tells us here through his Word
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:18.580]   that if we are in Christ, we are no longer in Adam.
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:22.980]   We are no longer under the reign and the rule of sin.
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:30.620]   We are in Christ, and we are under the rule and the reign of grace.
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:36.900]   And where sin abounded, grace hath much more abounded than will.
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:45.900]   I died to all the realm and rule of sin, and I am dead to it now.
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:55.700]   And if I fall into sin, as I do, it is simply because I don't realize who I am.
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:54:02.060]   We being what we are, realize it, reckon it.
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.700]   There's the argument.
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:10.620]   You are under the rule and the reign of grace.
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:17.980]   Shall not, you cannot go on living, therefore, in sin.
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:25.100]   And it can never be true, shall we sin, that grace may abound.
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:27.340]   Very well, there is the great argument.
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:31.860]   God willing, we must now proceed next Friday night and the following nights to consider
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:39.300]   the apostle, bringing it up into its relative parts and stating it again as a mighty whole
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:43.140]   when we come to the end of verse 14.
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.140]   Let us pray.
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:51.180]   O Lord, our God, we pray thee to open our eyes.
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:57.660]   Forbid it that any of us should stagger at thy Word because of its glory, because of
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:05.460]   its momentous character, because it holds before us what seems to flesh and to the natural
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:07.980]   mind to be impossible.
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:15.180]   O Lord, help us to see that if we question it or query it, we are thinking with carnal
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:16.460]   minds.
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:22.340]   We are like Nicodemus of old, thinking in terms of the flesh and not of the spirit.
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:29.140]   O, we pray thee, therefore, that we all by thy Spirit may have such a living, conquering
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:41.340]   faith that we can accept and believe the Word and know that we died unto sin, once and forever,
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:52.500]   that we are in Christ and in and under the reign and the rule of grace, and that our
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:56:01.580]   final perfect salvation is sure and guaranteed, that nothing can prevent it, that nothing
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:03.580]   can stop it.
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:11.300]   O God, give us this grace, we pray thee, to believe thy Word as it is in its star-spangled
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:21.220]   glory, the dark naked glory, that we may henceforth live ever, always to the praise of the glory
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:22.220]   of thy grace.
[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:30.220]   We ask it in Christ's name.
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:34.140]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
