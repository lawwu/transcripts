[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   A young man writes in to ask, "Pastor John, is it a sin for me to date a non-Christian
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.240]   woman?"
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.240]   What would you say?
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.360]   I want to ask, what does he believe sin is?
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.880]   In other words, if I were talking to him here before, I would say yes or no.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.240]   I would say, "Tell me what you think sin is, and here's what I'd be listening for.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.160]   In Romans 3.23, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.240]   So sinning is falling short of the glory of God, it seems.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.240]   What does that mean?
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.360]   What does fall short of the glory mean?
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.680]   And the word justereo means lack, so sinning is lacking the glory of God.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.520]   Well, lacking in what sense?
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.280]   I'm not supposed to be as glorious as God is.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.600]   Well, lacking in the sense of Romans 1.23, probably, where it says that sinners exchanged
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.280]   the glory of the immortal God for images.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.080]   When they exchanged, they lacked it.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.620]   In other words, they looked at the glory of God, they looked at images, maybe the one
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.320]   in the mirror, and they chose against God, and thus they lacked God.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.940]   So sin, I would say, is a preferring of anything over God.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.240]   And sins, plural, are the kinds of attitudes and desires and actions and words that come
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.920]   out of us when we prefer other things to God, when God is not our supreme desire, our supreme
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.920]   treasure.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.000]   So that's what I'd be looking for.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.040]   And then I would ask, so let's come to dating now.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.920]   What is that?
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.840]   Is dating an expression of a desire that another person has become more precious to me than
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.880]   God?
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.880]   Is it?
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.000]   And if it is, I don't care if the person's a believer or an unbeliever, Christian or
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.160]   non-Christian.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.180]   You can date a Christian and be sinning.
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.560]   You can date a non-Christian and be sinning because your affections or your love or your
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.360]   need for that person might reflect that God doesn't have a place in your life nearly as
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.520]   big and powerful and satisfying and beautiful as he ought to have in your life.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.600]   If you have a felt need for companionship that is greater than your felt need for God,
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.320]   then you're sinning and doesn't matter who it is that you're taking out, you need to
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.320]   go back and find God to be your treasure.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.600]   So that's more probably than what he was asking, but here's what he really, really wants to
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.400]   know probably.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.800]   Okay, let's say I don't have that problem.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.120]   I'm not craving another person more than I'm craving God.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.080]   Is it a sin to date an unbeliever?
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.840]   And my answer to that is, what is dating for?
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.640]   What are you treating dating as?
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.400]   And you might say, "Well, I don't have any romantic interest at all, and I want to testify
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.960]   to the grace of God to this unbeliever over pizza in the hope of leading her to Christ."
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.880]   In other words, this is just pure evangelism and not romance.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.440]   And I would say, "Okay, go for it."
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.720]   I think that's true, but be careful because anytime one man and one woman spend time together,
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.480]   more can happen than evangelism of a more personal, intimate, romantic kind, especially
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.480]   when you're talking about deep things.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.520]   I've seen it happen, and I would caution it.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:06.080]   But what if dating, what if he said, "Well, I really am attracted to this person, and
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.280]   dating for me is part of a cultivation of a romantic relationship that could lead to
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   marriage."
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.480]   Then I would say, "If you're doing that, if you're pursuing an unbeliever with a view
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.920]   to awakening, quickening, and deepening a romantic relationship that could lead to marriage,
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.920]   you're compromising your love for Christ, and you're going against what the Bible says,
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:36.280]   and you're doing something wrong because 1 Corinthians 7:39 says that we are to marry
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.020]   only in the Lord.
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.480]   And if you're on a trajectory to fall in love with and marry a woman who is outside the
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.960]   Lord, you're on a trajectory to disobey this text.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.480]   And to be on a trajectory to disobey a text is to disobey a text.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.720]   And 2 Corinthians 6:14, "Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers," ties in with that
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.840]   as it relates to marriage.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:11.880]   And I think the reason for that, Tony, is that marriage is a union of the deepest kind.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.000]   It's meant to be a union of soul as well as a union of body.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.600]   And there can't be any deep union of soul if two people have different supreme treasures,
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.520]   one Christ and another something in creation.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.080]   There's a deep disunion from the outset.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.720]   So to pursue a dating relationship, cultivating a relationship that would lead to a forbidden
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.520]   marriage is, I think, forbidden.
