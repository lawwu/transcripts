[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   - The fact that there is thousands,
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.440]   you know, hundreds of thousands, millions of people
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.840]   that watch that video, I think that's really powerful.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.840]   So how do you think the idea of putting lectures online,
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.840]   what really MIT OpenCourseWare has innovated?
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.280]   - That was a wonderful idea.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.280]   You know, I think the story that I've heard
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.280]   is the committee was appointed by the president,
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.560]   President Vest at that time, a wonderful guy.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.020]   And the idea of the committee was to figure out
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.020]   how MIT could be like other universities,
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.140]   market the work we were doing.
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.240]   And then they didn't see a way, and after a weekend,
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.800]   and they had an inspiration,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.560]   came back to President Vest and said,
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.800]   "What if we just gave it away?"
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.800]   And he decided that was okay, good idea.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.080]   So--
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.200]   - You know, that's a crazy idea.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.240]   If we think of a university as a thing
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.580]   that creates a product, isn't knowledge,
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.120]   the kind of educational knowledge,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.200]   isn't the product and giving that away,
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.680]   are you surprised that it went through?
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.840]   - The result that he did it,
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.280]   well, knowing a little bit President Vest,
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.640]   it was like him, I think.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.920]   And it was really the right idea.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.880]   You know, MIT is a kind of,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.420]   it's known for being high-level technical things,
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.840]   and this is the best way we can say,
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.120]   tell, we can show what MIT really is like.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.920]   'Cause in my case, those 1806 videos
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.480]   are just teaching the class.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.200]   They were there in 26-100.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.400]   They're kind of fun to look at.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.880]   People write to me and say,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.840]   "Oh, you've got a sense of humor,"
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.440]   but I don't know where that comes through.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.240]   Somehow, I've been friendly with the class,
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.240]   I like students, and linear algebra,
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.120]   we gotta give the subject most of the credit.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.400]   It really has come forward in importance in these years.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.300]   (upbeat music)
