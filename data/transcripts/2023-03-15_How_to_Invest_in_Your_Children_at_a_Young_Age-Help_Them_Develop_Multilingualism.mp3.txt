[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.140]   How to Invest in Your Children When They're Young series.
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.040]   Not the catchiest of titles,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.040]   but it is something that I believe very passionately
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.540]   is under-discussed and under-appreciated
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.940]   in the marketplace of ideas,
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.760]   which is why I'm taking a significant amount of time here
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.620]   in the podcast to go through it.
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.480]   We began by talking about all of the basic things
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.020]   that make up your child's genetic material.
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.300]   Then we talked about investing
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.700]   into your child's body in various ways.
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.440]   And now we're talking about investing
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.700]   into your child's mind.
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.700]   We talked about word acquisition, literacy,
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.740]   and mathematics, and numeracy.
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.940]   And now I want to pivot to multilingualism,
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.940]   because I think multilingualism,
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.980]   meaning helping your child to acquire
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.220]   more than one native language,
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.020]   is a very clear example,
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.540]   not only of how you can make your children smarter,
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.500]   both in, I believe, the physical sense
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.980]   of actively stimulating the gray matter
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.660]   that's between their ears,
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.800]   but also kind of in the more commonplace sense,
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.140]   meaning you're smarter when you know more things,
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.540]   you're smarter when you have a greater appreciation
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.460]   of the world, and multilingualism accomplishes
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.140]   both of those senses.
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.500]   Not only is this a good example
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.580]   of making your children smarter,
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.500]   but it's also a good example
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.020]   of the importance of beginning while young.
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.640]   So before I talk about the benefits of multilingualism,
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.860]   I want to take a few minutes and emphasize
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.860]   the importance of starting when you are young.
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.460]   And I want to begin that with a story.
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.660]   I want to share with you the story
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.440]   of how I learned my first second language,
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.220]   which was Spanish.
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.540]   I grew up in South Florida.
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.060]   I was surrounded by Spanish-speaking people on occasion,
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.820]   but I had no consistent exposure to the language.
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.020]   I remember at one time when I was very young,
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.260]   my family decided we were gonna learn some Spanish,
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.180]   and so we wrote some Spanish phrases on flashcards,
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.220]   and we tried to learn and memorize those phrases,
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.660]   and it didn't work.
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.760]   My parents didn't have the,
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.040]   whatever they were missing.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.640]   My parents didn't follow through.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.860]   I didn't follow through.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.140]   No one forced me to do it,
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.620]   so I was aware that Spanish was a thing,
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.020]   but I didn't have any exposure to Spanish.
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.140]   But I did have some elder siblings
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.500]   who had successfully learned Spanish,
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.380]   some to a very high level of fluency.
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.300]   And because of that,
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.860]   I understood that it was useful to speak Spanish.
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.060]   So in high school, I took two years of high school Spanish,
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.180]   Spanish one and Spanish two.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.560]   Don't remember exactly the grades.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.060]   I'm gonna guess 10th and 11th grade.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.940]   Could have been 9th and 10th.
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.620]   I don't remember exactly.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.140]   And in those Spanish classes,
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.300]   I found that it wasn't particularly difficult to me.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.660]   I did my homework.
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.300]   But because I observed
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.220]   that Spanish was something that was useful,
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.340]   I did something that most of my peers did not.
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.980]   And that thing that I did was I tried to use
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.020]   the basic and broken Spanish that I had
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.520]   when I had opportunity.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.540]   When I was in high school,
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.220]   I worked on a farm for several years.
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.960]   I worked on lawn maintenance crews,
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.660]   and so I was around a primarily
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.780]   Spanish-speaking immigrant population.
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.940]   So there were lots of chances for me
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.500]   to try out my little Spanish with them.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.620]   And of course, they were happy to talk with me,
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.380]   and that inspired me and motivated me to keep going.
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.140]   I also, I didn't have a lot of instruction
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.860]   on how to improve my Spanish,
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.100]   especially as an autodidact.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.260]   I had the instruction that I had in Spanish class,
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.660]   but no one taught me how to go on learning.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.820]   In hindsight, I desperately wish
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.340]   that my teachers had given at least a class period or two
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.780]   to say, "Hey, if you're interested in learning more
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.600]   "than what I've been able to teach you in this class,
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.500]   "here are some of the things that you can do."
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.700]   It took me about 15 years until I finally started,
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.580]   actually more than that, until I finally had a plan
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.700]   to how to improve my own level of Spanish
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.200]   through self-study.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.380]   I thought I just needed to talk more in order to get better,
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.860]   which was a completely wrong-headed assumption that I had.
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.620]   But back to my Spanish,
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.100]   I also developed a simple technique
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.180]   that helped me to achieve a significant level of fluency,
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.860]   or I would rather say fluidity,
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.180]   because there's so much misunderstanding
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.100]   about the use of this term fluency in language learning,
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.620]   but it helped me to develop fluidity
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.740]   with my ability to express myself in Spanish,
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.660]   and that technique was I just simply practiced translating
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.800]   in my head when I was listening to people talk,
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.460]   listened to lots of classes, went to speeches, seminars,
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.060]   church meetings, et cetera,
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.620]   and when I would hear people speak to me,
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.360]   I would keep my mind busy by just figuring out
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.540]   how to do simultaneous translation.
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.920]   And that skillset of constantly searching for ways
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.780]   to describe something
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.020]   when you're missing the vocabulary necessary
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.460]   helped me to achieve a much higher level of fluency,
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.220]   meaning the ability to express my thoughts
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.220]   in a fluent and flowing way, than many other people.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.520]   It was only many years later
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.460]   when I look back on that experience,
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.420]   and I started to figure out why
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.420]   what I did worked and why what other people did not work.
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.940]   And quite simply, it is a function of time,
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.060]   time spent with the language.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.420]   The single most important metric to study
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.140]   when you are thinking about acquiring a foreign language
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.140]   is time with the language.
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.720]   Every language can be learned,
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.500]   even if you don't start when you're young,
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.660]   we'll cover some of those myths later in the episode,
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.060]   just a matter of taking and spending the time
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.880]   with the language.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.780]   If you spend a lot of time with the language,
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.420]   and you're going to acquire the language
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.020]   in the fullness of time.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.540]   But if you only spend a little bit of time with the language,
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.540]   you're not gonna acquire the language.
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.520]   So I went back and I started doing some math.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.980]   And let me show you the math
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.560]   of what it takes to learn a language.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.620]   First, let's begin with a baseline.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.740]   In the United States,
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.740]   there is a governmental organization
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.340]   called the Foreign Service Institute.
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.300]   And the job of the Foreign Service Institute
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.300]   is to provide language training and culture training
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.300]   to US government employees who need to learn a language
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.260]   for various reasons, frequently diplomats, et cetera.
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.720]   Foreign Service Institute has been doing this job
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.100]   for in excess of seven decades.
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.940]   And during that time,
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.300]   the teachers have acquired a great deal of expertise
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.480]   in what it takes to teach English speaking persons
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.260]   a foreign language.
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.820]   And what they have done is they have provided
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.540]   publicly available at state.gov,
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.580]   you can look it up yourself.
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.980]   They have provided a chart or a set of rankings
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.460]   for how long it takes to learn a foreign language.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.020]   They provide this chart in terms of a number of weeks
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.500]   of instruction and class hours.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.020]   And they divide languages into categories
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.380]   one, two, three, four, and five.
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.460]   I'm not gonna go over all of these,
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.460]   but first let me define a few terms.
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.580]   When the Foreign Service Institute indicates
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.940]   that someone is proficient,
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.220]   they use their own internal scoring.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.500]   Here's what they say on their website.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.780]   The following language learning timelines
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.720]   reflect 70 years of experience in teaching languages
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.300]   to US diplomats and illustrate the time usually required
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.860]   for a student to reach, quote,
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.660]   "professional working proficiency in the language,"
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.780]   or a score of speaking three, reading three
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.300]   on the interagency language round table scale.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.400]   These timelines are based on what FSI has observed
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.200]   as the average length of time
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.220]   for a student to achieve proficiency.
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.980]   Though the actual time can vary based
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.060]   on a number of factors,
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.620]   including the language learner's natural ability,
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.060]   prior linguistic experience,
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.180]   and time spent in the classroom.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.860]   So this definition of fluency,
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.940]   they call it professional working proficiency.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.540]   We might, I think of this as about a B2 or a C1
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.060]   on the common European framework for languages
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.180]   that is most commonly used today
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.220]   to discuss linguistic ability, et cetera.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.700]   And what they use is, let's go for example,
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.780]   category one languages,
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.660]   or languages that are very similar to English,
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.060]   or more similar to English.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.940]   And these languages take anywhere from 24 to 30 weeks
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.400]   for the student to learn.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.780]   Now, when they say weeks,
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.700]   what they define that as is five days,
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.140]   excuse me, five hours of classroom instruction
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.300]   for a language learner, five days per week.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:19.300]   So a total of 25 hours over the course of a week.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.500]   I don't think this is an all encompassing number.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.660]   Their students are encouraged to go
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.060]   and spend more time and self-study outside of the classroom,
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.460]   but this is their baseline number,
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.260]   is five hours a day, five days a week.
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.500]   And they estimate the category one languages,
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.820]   such as Danish, Italian, Romanian, Dutch,
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.460]   Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish,
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.540]   these are all 24 week languages.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.300]   So if you multiply 24 times 25,
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.000]   you wind up with 600 hours.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.940]   And so they estimate that Spanish
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.260]   is a 600 class hour language.
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.340]   Also included in this category
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.420]   would be a language like French,
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.420]   which they say is a 30 week language.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.660]   So 750 class hours to acquire the French language.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.660]   And this gives us a good baseline.
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.940]   Now we go up, category two languages
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.380]   are a little bit less similar to English,
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.460]   but still fairly close.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.460]   These are 36 week languages or 900 hours.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.420]   This would include German, Malay, Swahili,
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.300]   Indonesian, Haitian, Creole,
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.040]   lots of category three languages,
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.820]   which require 44 weeks or 1100 class hours.
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.460]   This would be Albanian, Burmese, Estonian,
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.580]   Georgian, Hindi, Kazakh, Lithuanian,
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.980]   Nepali, Serbo-Croatian, Thai, Turkmen, Uzbek,
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.300]   Vietnamese, Ukrainian, Turkish, Tagalog,
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.840]   Slovak, Russian, Latvian, Icelandic,
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.220]   Hebrew, Finnish, Bulgarian, et cetera.
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.920]   Greek, you know, Lao, Macedonian, Polish, et cetera.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.140]   So these are 1100 hour languages.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.980]   And then you go up to category four languages,
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.720]   which they classify as languages
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.140]   which are super hard languages.
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.680]   Languages that are exceptionally difficult
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.100]   for native English speakers
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.500]   because of their dissimilarity from English.
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.180]   And category four languages require 88 weeks
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.740]   of classroom instruction or 2200 class hours.
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.700]   These languages would include Arabic,
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.780]   Chinese, Japanese, Korean, et cetera.
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.400]   So this gives us a baseline.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.760]   So now let's go back to my high school experience
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.580]   and let's think and talk about what actually happened.
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.180]   Remember that in this high school,
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.500]   we were on what is a traditional schedule
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.740]   in the United States.
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.000]   In the United States, schools do 180 days
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.100]   of classroom instruction per year.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.420]   That's fairly common on a global average
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.540]   within kind of the Western European nations,
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:39.240]   180, 190 is the norm of numbers of days per year
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.580]   of classroom instruction.
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.660]   I think Japan is, what is it, 220?
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.660]   I don't remember exactly.
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.060]   So there's some that are higher,
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.900]   but about is 180 hours, excuse me, 180 days in a year.
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:54.500]   When I was in school, our classes were 50 minutes in length
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.180]   and that was counted as an hour,
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.060]   but it was 50, five, zero minutes.
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.980]   And of course, if we think about the amount of time
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.100]   that a classroom teacher has to teach in class,
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.760]   it's something less than the amount of time on the schedule.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.380]   I'm gonna estimate that if you have 50 minutes
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:17.260]   in a classroom period, a superbly prepared teacher
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.040]   could perhaps deliver 30 to 35 minutes
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.100]   of actual instruction.
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.400]   You have five minutes to welcome everybody,
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.260]   get everyone settled down, everyone in their seats,
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.840]   when the bell rings, et cetera,
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.860]   make announcements, et cetera, get the class started.
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.980]   You're gonna be interrupted at some point in the lesson
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.820]   for various five minutes here and there.
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.340]   And then you're gonna have five minutes at the end
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.020]   where you're basically winding down.
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.400]   So a superbly prepared teacher who's very, very
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.700]   on top of his game could probably do 35
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.380]   to maybe 40 minutes of instruction in a period.
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.020]   And then of course, in the course of an academic school year
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.080]   there are many days that are lost
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.200]   to various other activities.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.200]   You might have homecoming week,
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.980]   you might have teacher absent days,
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.720]   you might have testing or some kind of school activities
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.220]   that are causing you to disrupt your normal schedule.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.920]   The first few days in from summer vacation
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.860]   are largely wasted and say the last week
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.220]   before summer vacation is largely wasted.
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.140]   So you're gonna get something less than 180 days.
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.440]   But let's assume for the sake of analysis
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.120]   that you could provide one hour of instruction
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.700]   in a 50 minute class,
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.180]   and you could do that for every single school day.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.180]   Well, you have 180 hours of instruction
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.700]   in a first year Spanish one class.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.760]   Multiply that times two years and you have 360 hours.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.540]   Of course, maybe there's some homework time,
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.820]   some things, other assignments that are assigned
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.540]   by the student, by the parent, excuse me, the teacher
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.920]   that allow the student to spend time studying,
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.200]   but still maximum I think is about 360 hours of instruction.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.500]   Do you see the problem?
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:02.300]   Is it any wonder that the vast majority of students
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.980]   who complete the required two years
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.740]   of foreign language instruction in high school
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.580]   do not come out of those two years
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.980]   with even a basic level of ability
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.640]   to communicate and enjoy a language?
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.080]   Even if that completely optimal scenario
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.240]   were somehow to be possible of 360 hours,
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.520]   we're still at about half
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.000]   of what the Foreign Service Institute needs
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.120]   to teach a highly motivated professional
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.280]   a foreign language like Spanish.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.480]   So what is the solution?
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.760]   Well, we could talk about pedagogy
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.480]   and helping the student to have more efficient ways.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.120]   We could talk about ways to motivate the student, et cetera.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.540]   But the simplest and most direct path
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.780]   to improving the outcome,
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.780]   if the desired outcome is to help a student
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.700]   to be fluent in a foreign language,
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.420]   the simplest and most direct path
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.340]   is to simply increase the amount of time spent
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.400]   in that study.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.740]   If we made Spanish one, two, three, and four
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.100]   the norm in our high schools,
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.060]   rather than Spanish one and two,
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.980]   I think most of our students
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.040]   would probably get close to fluency
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.600]   because their teachers are doing their best
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.540]   to use good methodology, good materials, et cetera.
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.500]   They just don't have enough time.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.560]   But if we know that we need 600 hours
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.600]   and we know that we are gonna get something
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.320]   less than 180 hours in a year,
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.880]   even at 150 hours, again, take it out over four years,
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.820]   we could teach a student a foreign language
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.960]   before that student graduates from high school.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.080]   And once you understand the math on it,
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.120]   it just becomes powerful when you recognize the result,
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.740]   the things that could happen.
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.160]   We'll talk in a moment about why they don't do that,
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.280]   but let's play with the math a little bit.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.920]   What if you started a little bit earlier?
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.640]   What if, for example,
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.920]   instead of foreign language instruction
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.840]   being something that was relegated
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.320]   to the required two years in high school,
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.640]   what if it was something that was done all the time?
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.160]   What if you had one hour every school day,
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.520]   so one hour, you had 180 hours per year
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.060]   over the course of a 12-year course of study of school?
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:26.960]   Well, that would give you 2,160 hours
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.960]   that is available for you if you did this
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.740]   for a one-hour period every school day for 12 years.
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.200]   What could a language teacher do with 2,160 hours?
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.920]   I think pretty easily the student could learn
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.160]   something like Spanish, 600 hours.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.160]   French, Foreign Service Institute would say 750 hours,
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.800]   but if the student already knew Spanish,
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.360]   I would say less than 600 hours based upon my experience.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.200]   Let's just say 600 hours for French,
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.600]   and then German, 900 hours,
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.240]   and you still have a little time left over to spare.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.800]   So if we did one hour per school day
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.280]   for 183 days per year over 12 years of school,
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.400]   then a student could come out with three languages learned.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.440]   Alternatively, we could take that time
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.260]   and we could invest it into some of those harder languages,
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.920]   those languages that are less similar to English,
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.440]   Arabic, or Chinese, 2,200 hours of instruction needed,
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.960]   and we could help a student achieve
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.660]   a very high level of fluency in these languages.
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:32.160]   What if you were motivated and you expanded
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.200]   the amount of time beyond the school year?
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:40.200]   In most working adults,
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.280]   you don't spend 180 days per year working,
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.960]   you spend something like 250 days per year working,
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.200]   depending on the country.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:54.160]   And so what if instead of doing this 180 days per year,
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.000]   we did 250 days per year, just one hour?
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.720]   Well, one hour times 250 school days per year
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.360]   times 12 years of school is 3,000 hours.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.480]   Once again, the student could learn pretty simply
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.420]   three, maybe four languages, maybe Portuguese, 600 hours,
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.280]   Dutch, 600 hours, Swahili, 900 hours,
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.760]   maybe Greek, 1,100 hours, with those 3,000 hours.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.080]   What if you increased the amount of time still more?
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.620]   What if you did two hours per day?
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.780]   I probably should have started the podcast with this,
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.040]   but in my family, we've gone in the last three years
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.760]   from being, last three and a half years,
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.720]   from being a monolingual family to now,
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.800]   at varying levels, depending on the student,
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.080]   achieving a pretty high level of fluency in four languages,
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.560]   and we're starting the study of our sixth
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.800]   and seventh languages.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:49.040]   And so what if you, but we do more than an hour a day.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.360]   I break it up, but what if you did two hours per day?
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:57.360]   Two hours per day, and you did it, say, 300 days per year,
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.320]   because you used better techniques and methods
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.240]   that made it not onerous and burdensome,
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.720]   but rather joyful and enjoyable.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.160]   Well, two hours per day times 300 days per year
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.320]   over 12 years, that's 7,200 hours.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:17.320]   So in that 7,200 hours, a student could very feasibly
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.800]   learn Italian, 600 hours, Greek, 1,100 hours,
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.640]   Hebrew, 1,100 hours, Korean, 2,200 hours,
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.320]   and Arabic, 2,200 hours.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.160]   And then finally, let's play with the math
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.600]   still one more way.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.760]   What if instead of language acquisition being something
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.360]   that was constrained to schoolwork,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.760]   it was something that was part of your family culture?
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.280]   What if you gave yourself a total of 16 years of time,
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:49.280]   starting at age two instead of at school age,
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.080]   and so you had 16 years from age two to age 18?
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.240]   Well, two hours a day, 300 days per year, 16 years,
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.400]   that's 9,600 hours.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.120]   So in theory, a student on that kind of schedule
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.680]   could learn Spanish, 600 hours, French,
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.920]   let's call it 600 hours, German, 900 hours,
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.480]   Greek, 1,100 hours, Hebrew, 1,100 hours,
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.000]   Russian, 1,100 hours, Arabic, 2,200 hours,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.380]   and Mandarin Chinese, 2,200 hours.
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.620]   So the point is that that's what's available
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.240]   if you have more time.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.960]   Is it impossible to do that?
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.640]   No, it's not impossible to do that.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.880]   It's just that most of us don't either have the interest
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.640]   or the system to do it.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.560]   There's one guy, I should have looked up his name,
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.400]   forgive me, a Canadian guy on YouTube
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.920]   and has a little channel devoted
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.800]   to helping develop multilingual children.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.280]   And in his family, his children all speak natively,
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.120]   five languages.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.120]   He, I believe, speaks Mandarin Chinese natively.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.480]   He's of Chinese ethnic origin.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.720]   So his children speak Chinese with their father.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.080]   His wife is Japanese.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.880]   They speak Japanese with their mother.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.840]   They have a Spanish-speaking nanny who lives in the home
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.680]   and speaks Spanish with the children.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.660]   And they live in, I think, Quebec, Canada,
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.620]   where they speak French and English natively
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.760]   with their friends and in their academic studies.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.760]   And so all of his children, basically from birth,
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.000]   are taught five languages.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.440]   If his children desire to intensively study language,
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.880]   they would fairly easily pick up several more.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.120]   And because they have learned such diverse languages
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.680]   from birth, it cuts down the learning,
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.280]   the acquisition time necessary
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.000]   for virtually all of the world's languages
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.320]   to far less than somebody who only speaks English
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.600]   and is now going and studying Japanese.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.340]   Because as you learn more languages,
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.600]   you have more connections, you have more cognates,
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.120]   it becomes faster and easier to learn languages.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.320]   So the key thing here is time.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:54.320]   If you start early, you can achieve far bigger results
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.720]   than in the long run.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.000]   So the question is, why don't we do this for our children?
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Why don't our schools require four years of language study
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.760]   instead of two years in order to graduate?
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.080]   Well, let's assume the best.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.160]   Let's not engage in conspiratorial thinking.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.500]   Let's assume the best, that the school administrators
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.520]   and program designers are trying to do their very best
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.200]   to help a student be prepared.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.040]   Why?
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.600]   If we know that a student needs a minimum of 600 hours
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.080]   of classroom instruction to achieve fluency in Spanish,
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.680]   why are we only devoting, say, 360 hours,
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.900]   or more realistically, far less,
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.820]   to that student's instruction?
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.680]   The answer is the opportunity cost.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.080]   If you are sitting down and designing
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.120]   any kind of academic curriculum,
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.040]   you have to choose what goes into it,
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.680]   and you have to choose what goes out.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.360]   And this is one of the big reasons
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.920]   why we should start language acquisition at a young age,
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.080]   because the opportunity cost of studying languages
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:03.560]   at a young age is very, very low.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.440]   But as the student ages,
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.640]   the opportunity cost becomes more significant.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.120]   Let's imagine your 16-year-old is coming to you,
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.480]   and your 16-year-old is saying,
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.280]   "You know what, I'm super interested in Japanese,
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.080]   but I also have just been offered
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.680]   this really great summer job,
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.320]   or this really great internship,
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.920]   working in the kind of business
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.160]   that I think would be cool to work in in the future."
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.360]   Your child has only so many hours available to him,
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.440]   so what advice are you gonna give him?
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.760]   Should he spend his time studying Japanese,
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.880]   or should he spend his time going and doing the summer job,
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.920]   or the internship?
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.840]   Now, in fairness, he can probably do both,
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.160]   because even as a teenager,
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.080]   teens still have huge amounts of time available to them
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.320]   to accomplish anything they can dream of,
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.800]   or anything you can dream up for them.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.960]   But you see the point.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.520]   That summer job is actually very important.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.960]   When you look at the subjects that are necessary,
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.880]   I may cover a subject like learning to code.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.760]   I don't think learning to code is important
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.720]   for a four-year-old, or a six-year-old, or an eight-year-old.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.800]   I do think learning to code is important
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.720]   for a 14-year-old, or a 16-year-old, or an 18-year-old.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.960]   And so what's gonna be more valuable in life,
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.760]   learning Mandarin, or learning to code?
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.880]   Generally speaking, I would say probably learning to code,
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.000]   depending on the interests of the child.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.760]   But what if you could do both?
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.920]   The way you can do both is by moving it younger.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.760]   So when you look at the young ages of a child,
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.640]   and you think about what's necessary for that child,
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.840]   and what should a child be focused on
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.640]   during his younger years,
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.960]   language acquisition is a very natural fit
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.080]   for the development of the human brain.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.920]   Speaking of coding, I have looked for a very long time
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.360]   to try to find all of the best information I can
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.440]   about teaching a child to code.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.920]   And while it's becoming more normal
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.640]   that coding is becoming part of the school curriculum
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.280]   from K through 12 in many cases,
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.840]   I have not yet found compelling evidence
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.880]   that a child really needs to be exposed
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.360]   to learning to code from kindergarten onward.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.560]   It seems to me that there's plenty of time
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.720]   in the middle school years and in the high school years
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.680]   to introduce the subject of coding
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.200]   when it seems a little bit more developmentally appropriate,
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.040]   at least to me.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.400]   When you look at mathematics,
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.240]   I shared some of the arguments against
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.480]   intensive early study of mathematics.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.320]   What else?
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.480]   What about something like music?
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.520]   I think music is really valuable,
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.800]   but I also have spent quite a lot of time as a young child
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.320]   wrestling against my parents and against my music teachers
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.920]   'cause I didn't wanna learn music.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.960]   I spent some time wrestling with my own children,
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.720]   trying to get them to learn music.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.400]   And when you look at how slow the progress is
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.120]   for a very young child to learn music
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.760]   versus how quick the progress can be
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.560]   when the student is a little bit older,
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.560]   I'm not convinced that forcing music study
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.920]   on young children is productive for most people.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.360]   If you have a prodigy, if it fits your culture, go for it.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.400]   I think it's awesome,
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.240]   but I'm not convinced it's necessary to force it.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.800]   So what are you left with?
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.520]   Well, you're left with all the natural, normal things
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.520]   of childhood, character development,
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.240]   virtue development, et cetera,
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.040]   lots of time playing outside, playing with friends,
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.280]   free play, art, et cetera.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.680]   But at its core, language acquisition is a core function.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.000]   And so in the same way that I spoke extensively
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.240]   about the value of studying your primary language
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.560]   at an early age and the number of words,
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.360]   the same thing applies to acquiring multiple other languages.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.880]   These are golden years
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.600]   in which there are few competing choices
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.040]   for the time that are productive,
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.720]   and yet we can help a child be set up to be far ahead
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.680]   with later options
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.560]   if we help a child to be multilingual from birth.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.560]   So what I've just shared is clearly an extensive discussion,
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.440]   but when you understand the math,
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.200]   you can understand how powerful it is
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.120]   to invest into your child at a young age.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:19.640]   Many, many college students all over the world go to school
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.840]   and spend a lot of money and a lot of time
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:27.760]   to take a degree in English, in Spanish literature,
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.360]   in Japanese language and culture, et cetera.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.160]   And I would say that if you had a coach
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.040]   and you had the right materials,
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.880]   you can pretty well set the foundation
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:44.520]   to where your child can acquire the equivalent knowledge
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.760]   fairly easily just in his spare time
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.880]   long before he ever graduates from high school.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.480]   I've spent a good amount of time
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.440]   trying to find the best universities,
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:59.160]   going and finding all of their syllabus,
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.280]   their syllabi that they have for their students.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.880]   I go and try to find their reading lists
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.440]   for their Spanish literature major,
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.520]   their French literature major, et cetera.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.120]   And then I go and try to look
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.880]   and make lists of the resources, right?
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.040]   I'm a homeschool dad, this is what I do, make reading lists.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.640]   And while not all of it is appropriate to,
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.320]   certainly much of it is not appropriate to a young mind,
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.000]   I'm convinced that an average teenager
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.160]   who's been taught the language from an early age
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.160]   can just simply pretty easily absorb the reading list
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.000]   of one of these majors just for fun in his teenage years.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.120]   And while he's not gonna have the discussion
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.520]   and the argument and whatnot in a college classroom
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.040]   and probably not appreciate all of the piercing insights
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.800]   that you could have in analyzing literature
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.320]   at the collegiate level, you can get 80% of the way there
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.120]   to the value of a Japanese language and culture degree
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.960]   just simply through acquiring a language at a young age.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.120]   It's a powerful, powerful idea
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.720]   when you understand the math.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.120]   - Now for a limited time at Del Amo Motorsports.

[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.000]   you're not going to find a better deal

[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.640]   - Thus far, I don't think I've said anything
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.400]   that is particularly controversial.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:41.160]   Most people, if asked, do you think it's a good idea
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.760]   that a child be taught a second language?
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.960]   Most people would agree, absolutely it is.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:50.000]   If you're, depending on what language you're talking about,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.440]   I would say that most people outside of the English world
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.240]   would say it's essential that your child
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.720]   be taught a second language.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:04.720]   I don't think there is a wealthy, knowledgeable, educated
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.960]   set of parents out there who,
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.640]   if English is not the native language of their child,
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.640]   does not consider English language acquisition
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:19.640]   and instruction a high priority for their child's education.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:23.320]   There certainly are, in the English-speaking world,
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.600]   many parents who don't think it's a high priority
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.840]   for their child to learn a second language,
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.640]   but they do think it's a good idea.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.000]   I wanna now talk about the concept of,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.280]   is a child better at learning languages?
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.480]   There is, in bringing this subject up,
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.600]   an oft-repeated refrain which simply says,
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.400]   oh, children should learn a second language
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.520]   while they're young because they can just learn it better
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.920]   than when they're older.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.640]   I do not believe that myself that this is true,
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.400]   or at least if it is true,
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:58.360]   I can't find any good data or evidence to back it up.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   And when we think of the circumstantial evidence
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.160]   that all of us have of observing children acquire languages,
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.960]   I don't think that it bears out the idea
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.520]   that children are better at learning languages.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:15.520]   In fact, I think that adults or motivated young people
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.000]   who are not children are actually better
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.080]   at learning foreign languages
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.840]   because they have a whole set of tools
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.560]   that young children cannot apply.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.920]   Adults can use tools like self-discipline,
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:31.800]   focused study, grammar instruction, et cetera,
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.400]   to help them to learn a foreign language
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.800]   much more effectively than children can.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.480]   Children basically are wandering around the world
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.360]   sort of kind of understanding at some point,
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.560]   and they don't generally have the motivation,
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.320]   the self-discipline, et cetera, to make fast progress.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.120]   I think the reason people say
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.120]   that children are better at acquiring languages
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.240]   has more to do with the amount of time
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:59.480]   that children spend on language acquisition versus adults.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.760]   Remember that language acquisition is a function of time,
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.960]   and children have the great benefit
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.040]   that their parents take care of everything for them,
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.040]   and about their only job is to learn languages.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.600]   I have a baby in the other room,
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.160]   and that baby is sitting either in his mother's arms
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.440]   or in a little carrier or a little seat or something,
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.080]   and all that baby has to do is look around the room
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.200]   and listen to the sounds that are around him
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.800]   and start to decipher them and figure them out.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.160]   And for the first couple years of his life,
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.120]   the only thing he will have to do for himself
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.760]   is just sit and listen.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.120]   And after a couple years, he'll start making a little,
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.520]   you know, some noises and unintelligible,
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.240]   you know, single-word constructions here and there,
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.880]   and then after a few years,
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.120]   he'll start to spontaneously speak
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.440]   in the beginning with many, many mistakes,
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.600]   and in the fullness of time,
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.640]   when he reaches seven, eight, nine, somewhere in there,
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.520]   he'll speak with smooth, sophisticated grammar
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.240]   and start to develop a complex vocabulary.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.520]   Takes him many, many years to develop language ability,
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.600]   and that's all he has to do,
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:08.160]   spending eight, 12, 16 hours a day on this one task.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.360]   As an adult, when you go to study language,
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.600]   you often have 15 minutes a day, 30 minutes a day,
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.640]   because you've gotta feed and clothe
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.400]   and earn the money and everything that's necessary
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.840]   to support all of those other ones
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.440]   that are depending on you for their language acquisition.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.960]   So children spend far more time learning language
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.920]   than adults do, and that's one reason
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.880]   why they seem to be so good at it.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.320]   The second reason that we consider children
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.280]   to be so good at language is the level of language output
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:42.760]   that we expect of them is fairly simple and unsophisticated.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:46.240]   As an adult, an educated adult,
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.440]   we consider, we think of language in a very complex ways.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.120]   Our thoughts are very complex and sophisticated.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.280]   And so when we wanna speak in a foreign language,
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.000]   we get frustrated if we can't express
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.960]   complex, sophisticated language.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.440]   Whereas children, their language is generally simple,
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.640]   very repetitive, very action-oriented, et cetera.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.340]   It's the simplest form of language.
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.700]   The third thing that I think does come into play,
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:17.840]   when people talk about children learning languages better,
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.080]   after these factors, I think they're often impressed
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.560]   by the accent that children have.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.720]   There does seem to be some evidence
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.960]   that children who do not use,
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.360]   who do not listen to certain sounds at a young age,
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.960]   lose the ability to easily hear those sounds
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.840]   if those sounds are not reflected in their mother tongue.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.960]   And so it may be the case that adults
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.000]   may not be able to easily hear certain sounds,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.020]   but that can be trained and improved.
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.600]   But children often don't have a filter.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.400]   And so when they hear somebody speak in a certain way,
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.040]   they unconsciously acquire that accent.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.340]   And they sound very native because they don't have a filter.
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:01.080]   Whereas adults, we are filled with experiences
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.200]   and prejudices and opinions and whatnot
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.960]   that cause us to be careful
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.320]   and reserved about the accent that we express.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.320]   We do this in our native language.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.720]   I would never speak like a New Yorker, right?
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.920]   I would never speak like a Southern redneck.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.680]   These accents are repulsive to me.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.800]   I just don't like them.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.920]   I don't wanna be associated with them.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.400]   I don't wanna sound anything like them.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.680]   And so if all of a sudden I move to the deep South
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.580]   and living out in Hicktown,
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.920]   or if I moved to the Bronx or Brooklyn,
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.040]   I would never sound, no matter how long I lived there,
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.680]   I would never sound fully native
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.160]   because of this prejudice that I have
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.600]   against New Yorkers or against Southern rednecks.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.520]   On the other hand,
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.500]   children don't generally have those prejudices.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.720]   If I moved to the deep South or I moved to Brooklyn,
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.760]   my children would start to unconsciously acquire
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.200]   that local accent
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.160]   because they don't share my cultural prejudices.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.980]   Well, now bring it over to a foreign language
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.880]   and the same thing happens.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.160]   As adults, we often,
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.900]   if we're learning a foreign language that we like,
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:14.120]   it may be easier to adopt the persona of that culture
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.600]   and really embrace it.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.640]   But sometimes we're learning a foreign language
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.680]   that we wanna learn the language,
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.160]   but we don't love the culture.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.400]   And we don't necessarily want to sound exactly
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.960]   like everyone else there sounds.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.280]   And so we often have those filters,
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.520]   but children don't have those filters.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.080]   They just naturally and unconsciously absorb the sounds.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.120]   And so they can often speak
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.460]   with a more native sounding accent
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.160]   because they fully embrace the culture
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.600]   that is surrounding them.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.420]   So to conclude this section of when should you do it,
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.680]   when should you teach your children languages,
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.960]   you should teach your children languages earlier,
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.320]   not because it's easier to learn,
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.000]   but because you have the time
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.400]   to help your children launch as adults
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.960]   with a much higher level of fluency
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.600]   than you will have if you wait and wait and wait.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:10.600]   And also because this activity of language acquisition,
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.120]   this is how the child's brain is wired at that early age.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.960]   It's the most natural thing to do,
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.440]   and that's the time in which
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.300]   it has the lowest opportunity costs.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:24.200]   Let's pivot now to why should you learn a foreign language?
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.300]   Why should you teach your children foreign languages?
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.800]   Because even if you didn't start early,
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.320]   I still think you should start for a number of reasons,
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.140]   not the least of which to grow your children's brains.
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.960]   Let me read you a short excerpt
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.360]   from an article at parents.com recently updated.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.520]   The benefits of learning a second language as a child.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.560]   Raising kids to speak more than one language
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.520]   can offer emotional and academic benefits.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.400]   Here's how to help your kids pick up another language.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.240]   I'm going to skip the introductory paragraph
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.960]   and start with the benefits of being a multilingual child.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.120]   In a study published in January, 2021,
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:06.600]   in the journal Scientific Reports of 127 adults,
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.040]   two cognitive benefits for early bilinguals,
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.680]   those who learned two languages as children, were identified.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:17.020]   The first was their ability to notice visual changes
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.360]   faster than those who picked up
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.520]   a second language later in life.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.760]   The other revealed early bilinguals had more control
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.760]   over their ability to shift their attention
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.500]   from one image to another,
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.200]   which may stem from practicing shifting quickly
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.960]   between two languages.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.600]   While these are all wonderful perks,
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.680]   there are even more benefits to being bilingual
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.360]   and of course multilingual
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.900]   that experts are still learning about.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.120]   Encourages empathy.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.400]   Children who are raised with at least two languages
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.640]   have been found to have greater social understanding,
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.080]   says Oren Boxer, PhD,
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.000]   a neuropsychologist and advisor at BumoBrain,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.600]   a platform supporting parents looking for options
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.840]   aside from traditional schools.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:02.220]   For example, a 2013 article in Learning Landscapes journal
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.880]   found bilingual kids tend to demonstrate empathy better
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.840]   than their monolingual peers.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.340]   Specifically, bilingual children were advanced
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.120]   in understanding the following,
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.980]   other perspectives, other thoughts,
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:18.700]   other desires, other intentions, tone of voice.
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.260]   Part of this strength has to do
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.220]   with a more robust language system
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.500]   that can more readily detect
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.600]   certain features of communications,
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.240]   such as prosody, which is the rhythm of speech
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.940]   and tone of voice, says Dr. Boxer.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.820]   It is hypothesized that this developmental experience
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.980]   is different from monolingual children
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.820]   and it facilitates a more robust understanding
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.740]   of another perspective or theory of mind.
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.460]   However, encouraging empathy alone
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.380]   isn't enough to be seen as a benefit.
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.880]   Dr. Boxer says it's important to know how to cope
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.120]   with these empathic feelings
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.760]   and be able to distinguish one's own needs
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.920]   from the needs of others.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.900]   Boosts brain function.
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.980]   Being bilingual is good for a child's brain development.
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.660]   Quote, "They are better at planning, problem solving,
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:05.280]   "concentration, and multitasking," says Kristen Denzer,
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.000]   CEO and founder of Tierra Encantada,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.880]   a Spanish immersion education program.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.440]   Denzer, whose background is in psychology
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.200]   and educational policy,
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.260]   says these cognitive advantages can be seen quite early.
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.240]   Quote, "Infants immersed in a dual-language environment
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.960]   "have demonstrated their advanced executive functioning
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.900]   "as young as seven months old
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:29.020]   "when compared to monolingual peers," she says,
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.500]   pointing to a study published in 2009
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.000]   in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.780]   of the United States of America.
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.500]   And she says, "These benefits may continue into older age
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.860]   "by preventing brain disorders
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.500]   "that commonly present themselves in the mid-60s."
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:46.100]   Quote, "Bilingual individuals are even able to ward off
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.560]   "the onset of dementia and Alzheimer's
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.640]   "an extra four years on average
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.980]   "compared with those that speak just one language,"
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.380]   says Denzer.
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.480]   That's based on 2017 research
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.380]   in Clinical Interventions in Aging
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.240]   that reviewed bilingualism as a strategy
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.120]   for delaying Alzheimer's disease.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:05.440]   I'm gonna skip down, talks about how that's controversial
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.620]   and not unproven.
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:07.980]   Academic advantage.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.660]   "Bilingual children may also have an advantage in school,
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.080]   "including with literacy."
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.340]   Quote, "Studies have shown
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.020]   "that when a child learns a second language," says Denzer,
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.400]   "they show accelerated progress when learning to read
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.020]   "compared with monolingual peers."
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:24.780]   Denzer refers to a 2000 paper on bilingualism and literacy
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:26.260]   presented at the Research Symposium
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.680]   on High Standards in Reading
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.300]   for students from diverse language groups
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.780]   in Washington, D.C.,
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:33.340]   which explains that bilingualism provides children
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.500]   with heightened skills necessary for literacy.
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.860]   According to 2021 research in Frontiers in Psychology,
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.380]   learning two languages at an early age
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.960]   may reduce proficiency in a dominant language.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.180]   However, earlier studies also show literacy benefits,
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.260]   including bilingual children's better performance
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:53.220]   than monolingual children on metalinguistic awareness tests
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.940]   and acquisition of new words.
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:58.580]   Goes on, talks about other academic advantages.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.420]   The point is, when you learn two languages or more,
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.640]   there's good evidence that you become smarter.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.780]   You become better at academics.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.780]   Your cognitive functioning is enhanced,
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.940]   possibly even on a physical level,
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:16.380]   possibly even such that you can stave off Alzheimer's
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.380]   for an extended period of time.
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.540]   To cite that argument, I turn to chapter 18 of a book
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.220]   called "America's Bilingual Century,
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:27.820]   How Americans Are Giving the Gift of Bilingualism
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.300]   to Themselves, Their Loved Ones, and Their Country."
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.440]   Author is Steve Levine.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.140]   This book was published in the last year or so.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.800]   "Giving the Gift to Our Loved Ones.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.060]   For the first half of the 20th century in America,
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.060]   bilingualism was thought to be bad for children.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.860]   In 1939, the same year the New York World's Fair
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.700]   debuted its City of Tomorrow
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.140]   and the first demonstration of television,
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.300]   an American psychologist named Medora Smith
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.620]   published a study of bilingual children in Hawaii.
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:57.980]   She concluded that bilingualism caused a retardation
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.260]   of language development that could be counted in years
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.860]   compared with monolingual children.
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.380]   Her study presented lots of data.
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:09.860]   In fact, it was a quote, "monument to quantification,"
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.580]   according to the linguist Kenji Hakuta.
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.940]   The take-home message was that bilingualism
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.700]   in American children, whether arising from native languages
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.420]   or immigrants' languages,
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.420]   was something like a medical ailment
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.700]   that needed to be cured by an inoculation
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:27.580]   of modern monolingual English language education.
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:31.060]   Not until 1962 did two Canadian researchers,
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:34.340]   Elizabeth Peale and Wallace Lambert of McGill University,
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.900]   challenge this view.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.460]   They studied 10-year-old children in Montreal
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.820]   and, unlike prior studies,
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.900]   carefully controlled the selection of samples.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:48.020]   Their results turned a half-century of studies upside down.
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:51.100]   The bilingual children outperformed the monolingual kids
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:54.540]   in verbal and nonverbal intelligence tests.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.580]   It was a watershed moment.
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.700]   Lambert summed up the science that existed
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.900]   in the first half of the 20th century, quote,
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.540]   "Earlier studies over a 50-year period
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:07.060]   "had concluded strongly in favor of monolinguals
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.940]   "because, it turns out, they had not matched
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.780]   "bilingual and monolingual groups
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.900]   "on factors such as social class background,
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.620]   "nor had they measured the bilinguality
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.700]   "of those presumed to be bilingual."
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:25.700]   Bilingualism begets brainpower.
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.220]   Social science, like all science,
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.780]   progresses in a fitful, uneven manner
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.460]   toward becoming less wrong about the world.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.260]   After Peale and Lambert, scientists around the world
[00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.340]   began careful studies trying to parse out
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.740]   cognitive differences that might exist
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.580]   between bilingual and monolingual children.
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.260]   They have continued to find advantages
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.460]   for bilinguals having to do with their thinking,
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.900]   creative abilities, and empathy.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.780]   Also, scientists have found that being bilingual
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:55.340]   may help with the acquisition of additional languages.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.380]   Any delay among bilingual children
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:59.220]   in learning one language over the other
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.940]   appears to be temporary,
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.180]   while their total vocabularies are greater
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.820]   than those of monolingual children.
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.660]   At the other end of the age continuum,
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:11.260]   another Canadian research psychologist, Ellen Bialystock,
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.100]   has found mental health advantages
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.180]   in bilingual older adults.
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.220]   They appear to have an improved cognitive reserve,
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:21.700]   resulting in a later onset of the symptoms of Alzheimer's
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:24.460]   by approximately four years.
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.380]   Adding to these mental health benefits
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.900]   are economic reports that show measurable benefits
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.060]   to bilinguals in landing jobs,
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:34.140]   earning more money, and advancing in their careers.
[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.620]   Other studies show that these individual successes
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:40.260]   stack up to societal economic advantages as well.
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:43.100]   In the words of the polyglot author Gaston Doran,
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:47.060]   "The benefits of bilingualism have, in recent years,
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.780]   "been piling up like laundry."
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.900]   If you're interested in that book,
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:53.900]   it's called "America's Bilingual Century."
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:55.420]   It's an okay book.
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.460]   I won't say it's bad, it's okay.
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:59.780]   It just didn't floor me,
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.740]   but it's a good, useful discussion of the value
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:07.020]   and the benefits of bilingualism and multilingualism.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:12.740]   When you can speak multiple languages, you become smarter.
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:14.540]   You get more brain function,
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:17.540]   your brain fires more, more indifferently,
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.380]   you get more creativity in your thoughts,
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.580]   and you get better test results.
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.340]   To the extent that tests are effective
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:28.820]   at measuring intelligence, you get better test results.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.620]   One set of data that is interesting on this topic to look at
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:35.740]   are SAT scores for students who study languages.
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.340]   You can find these easily online
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.180]   if you just search SAT scores.
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.940]   Usually, you find this trumpeted
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.260]   by the proponents of teaching Latin,
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:47.460]   because in general, those who study Latin
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.220]   have the highest SAT scores.
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.460]   If you look at all the different languages,
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:55.220]   students of Latin have the highest SAT scores.
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:58.500]   Now, I don't know if this study has been done
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:02.060]   by somebody who has compared the social class
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:06.260]   of those who study Latin and their SAT scores.
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.860]   I don't know if Latin is causal
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:12.100]   to their SAT score maximization,
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:15.100]   or if it's correlated to their, I have no idea.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.660]   I assume it's both, it's probably both,
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.740]   that smart students study Latin,
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.500]   and students who study Latin become smart.
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.660]   The trick is, I don't know where you get on that trick,
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.660]   get on that trend, other than just to start,
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.260]   and become smarter by studying Latin,
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.500]   and then study Latin because you're smarter.
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:34.700]   What's interesting is, while Latin is always the highest,
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:37.340]   Hebrew is often, students who study Hebrew
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.900]   is often the second highest,
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.380]   then French and German sometimes take the place for third,
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:46.380]   and then Spanish is always kind of the lowest
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:51.380]   of the class languages in terms of impact on SAT scores.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.780]   But what is interesting is that even Spanish,
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:57.740]   as the least effective of the languages to raise SAT scores,
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:01.100]   has a dramatic increase in SAT scores
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.460]   of those who study Spanish,
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:06.020]   as compared to students who don't study a foreign language.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:09.660]   And so, studying foreign languages
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:13.500]   improves your test results, it genuinely does.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:17.300]   It allows you to look at the world more creatively.
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.620]   One thing you learn when studying foreign languages
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:24.140]   is how you can't express the same thought in all languages.
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.460]   And so you start to look at the world,
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:27.980]   and realize that your vision of the world,
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.140]   the way you look at the world,
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.320]   is constrained by the language that's in your head.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.380]   Your thoughts happen due to language.
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:36.880]   And if you don't possess,
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.880]   and you are imprisoned to the language that is in your head.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.340]   And so, I won't belabor the point,
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.380]   but you look at the world more creatively,
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:50.100]   and in a different way when you speak multiple languages.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:53.140]   I think a huge benefit also of teaching your children
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:56.020]   a second language,
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.580]   is what was alluded to in one of those articles,
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:02.300]   that once you learn your first second language,
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.860]   you then gain confidence in your ability
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.100]   to learn other languages.
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.280]   And you become better at it.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.860]   I am a better learner of languages now,
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.380]   having studied several,
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:18.220]   than I was when I was studying my first one of Spanish.
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.780]   I observe in my children,
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:23.900]   that my children are very good at learning languages,
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.020]   much better than I am,
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:28.020]   because they have now acquired several languages.
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.180]   And they see things that I don't see.
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.880]   They understand etymology in a way
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.440]   that I don't, they're better at it than I am,
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.780]   because they've done more of it.
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:40.460]   And also importantly, it opens the world to you.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.220]   If, especially as a native English speaker,
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:43.820]   if you're a native English speaker,
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.120]   there's only a small part of the world
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:51.060]   in which society is genuinely and truly English speaking.
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:55.460]   You have basically the United States, Canada,
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.020]   with the exception of the French speaking areas,
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.620]   England, Ireland.
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:03.380]   And then from there, it's all variations.
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.580]   You can go to areas where there are lots of English spoken,
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.780]   Singapore, Malaysia, many parts of Europe.
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:12.420]   You can go to the cosmopolitan areas, et cetera.
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.180]   But it's hard to find,
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.860]   and make sure I'm not missing anybody important,
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.360]   any fully English speaking countries.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.820]   I'm sure I'm missing a couple,
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:26.060]   but it's hard to find where the entire society is in English.
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:29.600]   Rather, you find intense bilingualism
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.980]   of English in many places.
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.340]   But how it happens is,
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.580]   even if there is a high level of bilingualism,
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:38.260]   and you can get by just fine with English,
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.760]   the world is not nearly as friendly to you
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.800]   if you don't fully understand a local language
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.300]   and a local culture.
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:48.380]   And so if you ever decide to move around the world,
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.080]   or you ever want your children to move around the world,
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.420]   just the knowledge and the confidence
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.520]   that comes from having learned another language,
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.080]   to know that, hey, give me a year, give me two years,
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.860]   maybe three, but I can master this language
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.580]   and be fully comfortable and competent in this language
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.420]   in one to three years,
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:09.920]   that opens up the world to you in a really neat way.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:14.720]   Also importantly, language learning is one of those things
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:19.000]   where learning just a little bit is still great.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.380]   You're better off learning a thousand words
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.780]   in a foreign language
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.980]   than learning no words in a foreign language.
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:29.280]   You're not gonna be fluent or conversant
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.360]   with a thousand word vocabulary.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.680]   But knowing those thousand words
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.700]   is much better than knowing zero words.
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.680]   And language learning also is one of those things
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:41.440]   where it's very hard to get worse at it.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.400]   It's not impossible.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:47.020]   If we don't speak a language on an ongoing basis,
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:50.200]   our ability to speak and create that language
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:53.640]   extemporaneously quickly slides away.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.540]   I think our brain kind of tucks it away and says,
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:57.080]   "Hey, this is not necessary right now."
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.960]   So you lose the ability just to speak off the cuff
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.020]   unless you're using it constantly.
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:05.580]   But it's still not that far away.
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:07.880]   You can give yourself a couple of days in the country
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.000]   where you're speaking the language
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:09.880]   and your brain all of a sudden
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.200]   brings all that knowledge to the forefront.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:15.320]   And so while it's not totally true,
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.120]   I'm pretty confident making statements like,
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.280]   "You don't get worse.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.880]   "You don't get worse.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.540]   "You might get better very slowly,
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:24.440]   "but you don't really get worse in a foreign language."
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.180]   And so learning a little bit
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:27.880]   sets someone up to learn more later
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:31.040]   and makes it easier in the fullness of time to do it.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.720]   Finally, why should you do it?
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:36.480]   If you believe that there's no benefit
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.560]   to learning a foreign language,
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.700]   I would just submit to you that it's still a major factor
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.880]   at some of the most elite universities and schools
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.480]   that you can find.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.980]   Recently, I was studying all the information I could find
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.980]   from Eton College in England.
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:56.160]   Eton College is kind of the classic, one of the classic,
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.280]   I don't know if it's the most elite,
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:01.080]   but one of the classic elite private prep boarding schools
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.360]   for boys in England.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.040]   I think it was started in the 1400s.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.860]   This is incredible long history,
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.000]   all the sons of kings and princes
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.840]   and all the hoity-toity who go to Eton College.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.040]   So I was looking through their promotional materials
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:18.500]   and trying to understand what their biases
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:22.240]   and what their, not biases, just their framework,
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.080]   their concepts of education are.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:28.120]   How do they do it at an elite college, boys college,
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:32.240]   high school, for high school students.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.480]   And I was just interested to see that every student
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:39.720]   who goes to Eton College is required to study English,
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:43.000]   is also required to study Latin,
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.640]   is also required to study two different
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.880]   modern foreign languages,
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:52.240]   and then some additionally have the option
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.940]   if they want to study ancient Greek.
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:58.600]   So at a minimum, every student who attends Eton College
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:02.120]   will have studied four distinct languages,
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:05.840]   English, Latin, and two other foreign languages.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.420]   I doubt that their students achieve
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.320]   high levels of proficiency.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.760]   I don't know.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:14.320]   But they have the same problem
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.520]   with the amount of time available
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.160]   that we previously discussed.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.720]   But they still consider it to be important.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.240]   And I think there are various reasons for it.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:31.760]   - California's top casino and entertainment destination
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:34.400]   is now your California to Vegas connection.

[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.800]   - Let's assume that you're persuaded at this point in time.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:59.120]   Let's go on to what language should you teach
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:01.520]   and how do you do it?
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.020]   What are some techniques that can work for it?
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:07.440]   So let's start with what language should you teach?
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.320]   Well, first, I think the obvious one
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:13.600]   is if English is not your native language,
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.320]   then you certainly should teach English.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:20.320]   English is the dominant lingua franca of the world today.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:23.320]   It is likely to be the dominant lingua franca of the world
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.840]   for a significant period of time.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:30.280]   I don't currently see where the competitor to English
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.080]   as the world's lingua franca would come from.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:36.240]   That's not to say it still will be the case in 300 years,
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.120]   but at the moment, it's not evident to me
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.640]   where a competitor to English would come from.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.120]   And I think that English,
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.260]   while it has its own set of difficulties
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.960]   that make it in some ways a difficult language,
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:51.120]   I think there is a whole opposite set of arguments
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:56.080]   as to how easy English is to learn and how flexible it is.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:00.880]   And so there are multiple reasons why English is becoming
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.840]   and is, sorry, is the world's lingua franca.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:07.160]   And those are not all having to do with jobs,
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:10.920]   business, economics, the power of the United States
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.240]   as the world's lone superpower,
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.640]   being an English-speaking nation, et cetera.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.440]   But there are other basic factors of the English language
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:20.220]   that make it very flexible and very useful.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:24.120]   English is the world's most spoken,
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.200]   most studied foreign language.
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:30.340]   And it is, well, not the world's most spoken language
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.220]   with number of native speakers.
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:36.240]   It is basically the world's most spoken language today.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.440]   There's different ways you can slice those charts,
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:39.960]   but English is the language that,
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:41.280]   if it's not your native language,
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.320]   needs to be the first one.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.680]   Also, English is the world's language
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:49.000]   with the largest vocabulary at this point in time
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.240]   and the fastest growing vocabulary
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.560]   of any language in the world.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:56.280]   And so studying English should be clearly
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.320]   the first priority.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.280]   And helping your children to achieve
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.880]   a very, very high level of English
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:05.160]   should be your first priority.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:07.480]   That is the clear winner
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.680]   as to what language should you teach.
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.200]   What about more than that?
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.640]   Well, any other language that you wanna teach
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.000]   is perfectly good.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   So if you have a language that you're connected to
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.240]   for some reason, or that's important to you,
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:21.400]   then teach that language.
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.260]   I think you can look at this practically.
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:25.720]   I think the most practical language to teach
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:32.000]   for me and for many of my US American listening audience
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.960]   is the language of Spanish.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:37.360]   My arguments are a fewfold.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.760]   Number one, for Americans,
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:43.560]   Spanish is the most dominant second language
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.080]   other than English at the moment.
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.200]   The United States, I haven't checked this data
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.640]   in a few years, could be out of date,
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:51.080]   but as of last time I checked,
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.520]   the United States was the fourth most populous
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.040]   Spanish-speaking country in the world.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.200]   And the United States is predicted
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.480]   to be the second most populous
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:04.280]   Spanish-speaking country in the world in the year 2050.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:08.320]   The first, the most populous
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.040]   Spanish-speaking country in the world today,
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.520]   as well as in 2050, is the immediate neighbor
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:17.160]   of the United States, which is Mexico.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:20.160]   And if you look at most of the neighbors
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.600]   of the United States, Spanish is the dominant language.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.800]   It's the dominant language of the islands of the Caribbean.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:28.880]   It's the dominant language of Central and South America,
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.080]   with the exception of the Portuguese in Brazil
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.680]   and the French-speaking communities in Quebec,
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:36.760]   Spanish is the most dominant language.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.280]   When you look at the number of countries
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:40.480]   that you could travel to, work in, et cetera,
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:43.440]   that share one language, Spanish is,
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.480]   I think, the leading language in that regard as well,
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.880]   in terms of the official language
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:50.600]   of a larger number of countries.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.600]   And the population of many of those countries
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.080]   is very, very high.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:56.320]   The population of Latin America, South America,
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.600]   et cetera, is very high.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.160]   And because this is a continent
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:04.120]   that is united by a few basic languages,
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:07.160]   Spanish is just a wonderfully useful language.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:08.960]   In addition, Spanish has the benefit
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:11.520]   of being exceedingly easy to learn.
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:14.160]   Every language has its own quirks,
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:16.520]   but Spanish is easy to learn.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.080]   The first thing that makes it easy to learn
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:20.400]   for English speakers is, excuse me,
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.320]   is its close connection to English
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:26.240]   that shares lots and lots of cognates.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:29.240]   Cognates are words that are connected,
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:31.720]   or excuse me, that sound the same in both languages.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:34.680]   And Spanish and English have lots and lots of cognates.
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.120]   So you could have computer, right,
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.400]   or in Spanish, computadora.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:43.560]   There are many, many versions of that that exist.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:45.840]   This is because of the Latin origins
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:48.440]   of much of the English language
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.400]   as well as the Spanish language.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:53.940]   And so Spanish also is easy to learn
[00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:56.040]   because there are lots of wonderful materials
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.880]   available for it.
[00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:59.240]   A language that doesn't have
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.440]   a lot of great learner's materials is hard to learn,
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.240]   but a language that has lots of materials
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.200]   is easy to learn.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.180]   And for an English speaker,
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:09.200]   the world of language learning materials in Spanish
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.560]   is just, it's top notch.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.480]   And you have lots of people with whom you can speak it.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.840]   It can be difficult to learn a language
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.640]   when you don't have anyone to speak it with
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.720]   and practice it with and listen to it.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.760]   But across the United States and in many parts of the world,
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.820]   of course today, anywhere in the world with internet radio,
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:26.760]   but across the United States,
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.240]   you can find a Spanish-speaking radio station
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.840]   on your local dial.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.480]   You can find lots of Spanish speakers
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.560]   with whom you can interact.
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.560]   It's just an easy language to learn.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.000]   And it's fairly straightforward,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.240]   great simple pronunciation system
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.720]   and very, very simple and straightforward language.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.680]   So I think Spanish should be the,
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.580]   is the obvious first language to learn.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.140]   From there, in terms of practicality,
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:52.100]   you can go to any language that would fit
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:53.660]   where you would desire to live
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.280]   or what you would want to do.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.160]   In a Western tradition from Western Europe,
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.280]   from the Western world,
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.000]   the European languages make a lot of sense.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.400]   And so after Spanish, French is pretty easy.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:12.520]   And so what I did was I taught Spanish and then French
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.520]   because French language structure is very analogous to
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.600]   and comparable with Spanish.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.680]   And yet the vocabulary of French is very highly known
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:27.640]   between English and Spanish.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.360]   A huge portion of English vocabulary
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:33.240]   comes directly from the French language.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.480]   And because much of that is descended from Latin,
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.080]   you have a close connection between the,
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.040]   you have just a massive leg up on ability
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.540]   to read the language, understand it, et cetera.
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:45.040]   So after you learn Spanish,
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.920]   it's pretty easy to learn French.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.360]   From there, you could continue
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:52.060]   with kind of the classic European trio of adding in German.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:54.980]   I think German makes a lot of sense for English speakers
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:57.780]   because while it's not all that significant
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.080]   of a language in the world today,
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.360]   it was formerly a very important language
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.960]   in scholarship, et cetera,
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.000]   but Germany has faded in many ways from global significance.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.720]   But still English is a Germanic language
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.560]   with a Latin vocabulary.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.420]   And so there's a close correlation
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:18.120]   between English and German, a lot of connections,
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.640]   and it can be a useful language.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.320]   The language that I find most useful
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.040]   traveling around the world is often German
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.600]   because the Germans are committed travelers.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:29.000]   You meet lots of wonderful Aussies and Kiwis
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.400]   and Brits and whatnot,
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.240]   but you're very likely to meet Germans
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.840]   in many corners of the world.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.880]   And so I enjoy that as a traveling language.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.040]   So then if you want to go further
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.460]   as with English being your dominant,
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.760]   the final languages that you could discuss
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.520]   would be Latin and Greek, kind of the classic languages.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.360]   Why?
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.720]   Well, if you look at English vocabulary,
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:52.120]   26% of English vocabulary comes
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:55.800]   from the Germanic head language,
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.060]   or let's just call it German.
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:00.740]   So 26% of English language is Saxon or German.
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:06.560]   29% of the English vocabulary comes directly from French
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.180]   and 29% comes from Latin.
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:12.340]   So total of about 60% of English vocabulary
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:14.980]   is coming from the Romance languages,
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.100]   which is why there's so many connections
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:20.240]   between Spanish, French, English, Latin, et cetera.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.540]   Then you have 6% of the English vocabulary
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.200]   that comes from Greek.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.900]   And so you could look at those classical languages.
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:28.500]   I think classical languages
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.460]   are really interesting and useful.
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:34.620]   We're in a classical language phase in our family now.
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:37.800]   So I introduced Latin a while back
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.640]   and then we've recently started on Ancient Greek.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:44.300]   And these languages are important to me,
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:47.260]   not necessarily because they're classical languages.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.900]   Latin is not super important to me,
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:50.740]   but after you speak the other Romance languages,
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:53.140]   Latin is pretty simple and straightforward.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:56.260]   So I figure, it's simple and easy, a few hundred hours,
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.740]   let's toss it in.
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:59.220]   But with regard to Greek,
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.380]   then we get to the heritage languages
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:03.320]   or religious languages that are important to me.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.360]   So of course, the Christian, the New Testament
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.660]   was written in Greek, in Koine Greek,
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:11.940]   and the Old Testament was written in Ancient Hebrew.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:14.620]   And so I think religious languages
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:17.020]   are really useful and valuable.
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.780]   I think that if you're looking for,
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:21.780]   if you're from the Christian world,
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:24.260]   I think learning Ancient Greek and Ancient Hebrew
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.660]   should be at the top of your list
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:27.860]   in terms of languages to study.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:29.660]   This is one thing that I actually admire deeply
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:30.780]   about the Muslims.
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:33.940]   Muslims have a strong commitment to Arabic
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:37.720]   and many, many Muslims all around the world study Arabic
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.580]   because of it being the language
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:43.500]   in which the Quran was written and delivered.
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.900]   And I think that's a really healthy kind of religious trend.
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:49.240]   And in many cases, Muslims put Christians to shame
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.080]   on that topic.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.660]   And I think that you should consider
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:53.820]   if there's a religious language that's important to you,
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:57.460]   I think that has a huge level of value.
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.260]   Then also consider heritage languages,
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:01.540]   things that reflect your culture,
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:05.660]   cultural significance that you would like to keep alive.
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:08.140]   And then you can argue about the classical language.
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:11.220]   I'm gonna save the classical languages for another time.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:14.740]   The key thing is once you've learned a second language,
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:18.420]   then the whole process becomes a lot less daunting
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:20.380]   and your confidence grows.
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:23.740]   So in my story, if we went back four years,
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:25.940]   ago we were a monolingual family
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:30.540]   and I had zero confidence in my ability to teach
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:34.500]   or even to acquire for myself another foreign language.
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.460]   Fast forward four years later,
[01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:39.520]   and again, I'm not being cagey with describing things.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.920]   It's just that each child is different.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.940]   I have five children.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:46.360]   And so I'm trying to be accurate with my comments,
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.520]   but also realistic with the fact
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.540]   that all the children are at different levels.
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:52.060]   And my older children are far ahead
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.740]   of my younger children, et cetera.
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:57.420]   But since then we have made tremendous strides.
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.780]   And at this point in time,
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:02.820]   I'm seeking to homeschool my children
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:06.680]   with fully integrated of four languages,
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.500]   English, Spanish, French, and German.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.660]   And then we're doing quite a lot of Latin reading
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.700]   and we've just started ancient Greek.
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:15.020]   So possibly in a couple of years,
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.460]   then Greek and Latin will be a bigger component
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:20.980]   of our curriculum.
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.740]   But we're doing homeschooling completely
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.340]   in those four languages.
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:25.980]   Every day, using all the languages
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:27.780]   and not just studying them as languages,
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:30.940]   but simply using them as a tool for acquiring knowledge,
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:33.780]   speaking them whenever possible, et cetera.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:38.060]   And so that confidence has grown with each language.
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:40.480]   And today I have full confidence
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.240]   that not only can I myself learn,
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.940]   but I can teach any language to my children
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:47.540]   that were motivated to teach.
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.040]   And so it becomes a matter of,
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.540]   are we willing to put in the time?
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.940]   Is there a reason for it?
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:56.280]   And is this the highest and best use of the time?
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.980]   Think back to what I said about a 16 year old.
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.500]   I don't think that acquiring languages
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.820]   is always the best thing for a 16 year old to do.
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:03.060]   Maybe a healthy activity,
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:05.140]   but it's not the most important thing.
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:08.780]   But for young children, it is very healthy
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:13.700]   and there's not a high opportunity cost for it.
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:16.780]   And once you get past the first few hundred hours
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:18.140]   of language study,
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:20.460]   where you're studying the language as a language,
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:22.700]   and you just get into the point of using the language
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:24.160]   as a normal part of life,
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.140]   you get to the point where you can watch a movie
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.700]   and just enjoy the movie with subtitles on,
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.940]   read a book and just enjoy the book for its own sake.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:33.100]   That's the magic point,
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:35.460]   because then it just becomes part of the lifestyle
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:37.460]   that yes, I use this language,
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:40.340]   but I use it for enjoyment, for life.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:42.460]   And the fact that I'm getting better at it
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.460]   is a useful add-on.
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:48.620]   We now turn to how to do it.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.300]   How do you actually do it?
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.060]   Well, there are many ways,
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:55.880]   and I'm not sure that one way
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.740]   is necessarily better than another.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.900]   I'm a little jealous of that Canadian guy
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:04.020]   who speaks Mandarin and has a Japanese wife,
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:06.500]   and a little jealous of that.
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.220]   But I don't have any of those things.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:09.820]   If you do have those things,
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:12.500]   meaning if you do have that linguistic background,
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.600]   the first thing is use what you have.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:19.540]   If you and your wife or your mother
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:24.060]   or someone speaks a heritage language, just use it.
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.220]   There are so many people
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:29.060]   who don't use their family languages.
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.540]   And in today's world,
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.700]   if we went back in the United States 100 years,
[01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:36.100]   there was a strong push
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:39.180]   to get everyone to be English-speaking.
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:41.660]   And that was seen as kind of the part
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.940]   of the cultural fabric of the United States,
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:46.320]   and so when you moved to the United States,
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.160]   you stopped speaking Norwegian and you spoke English,
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.460]   and you didn't try to teach it to your children, et cetera.
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:54.720]   In today's world, I think people appreciate
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:57.680]   more of the benefits of multilingualism.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:02.160]   And I think that you certainly should teach your children
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.800]   the language of the country that you live in,
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.640]   so you gotta teach English.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.760]   But maintaining that cultural language
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.480]   is such a benefit to your children.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.920]   It opens up doors for them,
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.740]   and again, all the benefits we've already discussed.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:16.020]   So just use it.
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.660]   Use the heritage language that you have.
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:21.500]   Now, one reason many people don't do this
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.420]   is they often feel insecure.
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:27.320]   This was the case with me, with my own Spanish ability.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.940]   When we had our first babies, my wife and I talked about,
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.340]   should we try to teach our children Spanish?
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:35.140]   Should one of us just speak in Spanish to them all the time?
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:38.900]   And we decided that I couldn't do it.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:40.180]   My Spanish wasn't good enough,
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.820]   and I was worried about teaching them poorly, et cetera,
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:45.780]   and it just wasn't working.
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:47.380]   I didn't think I could do it.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:48.940]   Today, what I would say to myself,
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:51.060]   if I were coaching myself back then,
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.420]   would be, all right, Joshua,
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:54.020]   you may not be able to do it really well,
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:56.140]   but you don't have to do it really well.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:58.540]   All you have to do is get the basics done.
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:02.140]   And so if you speak a basic level of Spanish,
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:04.980]   or if you speak a basic level of Norwegian,
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:07.100]   because your grandmother taught it to you,
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:12.100]   just use some of it to help your child to get started
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:16.180]   and then supplement with all of the normal
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:20.300]   native language resources that are at your fingertips.
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:24.940]   And if you can just give the basics, right,
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:26.540]   even a thousand words,
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.980]   and you get a thousand words to your child
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:31.380]   that you know, the basic thousand words,
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:34.300]   and then you fill the house with Norwegian picture books,
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.300]   and you watch Norwegian movies,
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.020]   and you go to Norway, et cetera,
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:39.360]   then your children can do the rest
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.160]   of the hard work themselves.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.740]   And so that's how I see it now,
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:45.580]   is that my job is basically to introduce the languages
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.140]   and introduce the materials,
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:48.500]   and then in the fullness of time,
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.940]   they'll just absorb the materials,
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:52.860]   and the materials is what teaches them the language.
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.740]   So when I teach my children languages
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.140]   that I don't speak well,
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:57.680]   I don't worry too much about the fact
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.740]   that I make tons of pronunciation mistakes
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:02.740]   and accent mistakes, et cetera,
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.260]   because I know that I'm not ultimately
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.700]   gonna teach them the language.
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:08.020]   My job is just to get them started in it,
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:09.580]   and then they're gonna learn their accent
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:11.540]   from a professional audio book narrator.
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:12.620]   I just gotta buy the books
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:14.500]   and then make them listen to them.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.480]   And they'll learn their accent from the professionals
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.940]   who have a great accent and who speak with proper grammar,
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:21.060]   and the professional writers, et cetera.
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:23.260]   So my job is to get them started.
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.420]   So if you have a heritage language,
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:27.220]   use it and just start,
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:30.580]   and speak to your children in that.
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:32.280]   This of course leads us to,
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:37.140]   can you intentionally create a language environment
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:38.140]   around your children?
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:40.300]   And the answer is, many people can.
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:41.580]   All around the world,
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:44.000]   the elite of the world send their children
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.200]   to private schools,
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:51.200]   and a key selling point of those private schools,
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.300]   at the minimum, is going to be a bilingual education.
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:57.420]   And so this is increasingly happening
[01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:59.540]   in English-speaking parts of the world as well.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:01.260]   You can find bilingual schools,
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:02.580]   and so you might enroll your child
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:05.940]   into a true bilingual school,
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.820]   or trilingual, or more.
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:11.180]   Again, many schools advertise themselves,
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:13.180]   and from the very beginning,
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:15.300]   they work in multiple languages.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.420]   You can also do this in a homeschool.
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:21.340]   One of the things that I have sought to do
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:23.780]   is to create in our own homeschool
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:27.000]   some of the major benefits of a school like that.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.060]   I can't do all of it, but I can do a lot of it.
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:32.340]   And so we can put books in multiple languages,
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:34.860]   we can use Khan Academy in multiple languages,
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.060]   we can do all kinds of stuff in multiple languages.
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:39.500]   So you may not be able,
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.660]   you have to get your children over that initial hurdle,
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:43.420]   but then it's just a matter of bringing in the books
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:45.380]   and the resources and the materials.
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:47.340]   And if you can cultivate a love of learning
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:48.500]   in your children,
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:51.660]   they pretty much teach themselves your native language
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:53.340]   by reading to themselves.
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:55.740]   And so get them started on a little bit of pronunciation,
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:57.760]   and they'll teach themselves the other languages
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:00.500]   by reading to themselves as well.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:05.500]   If you need to, so if you can't use a school,
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:08.500]   you may consider doing something like using family help.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:12.800]   You may hire a nanny, a maid, an au pair,
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.280]   someone who is gonna be around your house.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.660]   You might choose a piano teacher in a foreign language,
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:21.380]   somebody who's going to interact with your children
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:23.300]   in a foreign language.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:24.740]   These are all good options,
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:27.760]   it's bringing in professionals that are gonna help you.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.800]   You may choose to live in a community
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.160]   in which the foreign language is more broadly spoken.
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:36.200]   Go to a church where that language is broadly spoken,
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.700]   et cetera, all depends on your level of comfort for it.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:43.560]   Or you can just simply use tutors, classes, et cetera.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.120]   The basic method that I use to teach my children languages
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.040]   is bilingual translation.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.460]   I read to them in a foreign language
[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:53.920]   and I translate into English.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.600]   I use translation tools,
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.160]   primarily my favorite language app, LingQ.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.440]   I mentioned it a bazillion times,
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.760]   I ought to start getting an affiliate LingQ with them,
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:04.840]   L-A-N-G-Q, and I use that to read them children's books
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:08.320]   and whatnot, and I can use the built-in translation function
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.640]   which is basically accessing Google Translate
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:13.780]   to translate and help me to do it.
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:17.080]   You can also use other courses.
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:21.200]   I prepare audio files for my children of books and stories.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.780]   That allows me to use translation functions
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:26.520]   that I can find online and native speakers,
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.400]   and then I just replay those many times
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.800]   until they acquire and learn the knowledge.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.840]   There's a whole movement of what's dubbed
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:37.420]   comprehensible input channels for many languages.
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:39.200]   So you can go and you can find input
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.520]   and just have your children watch
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:46.000]   those language learning videos, et cetera.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.160]   There are many kinds of language acquisition things
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.480]   that you can learn.
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.440]   Most of the adult-focused ones
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.000]   aren't effective with children.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.140]   So if you get to a 10-year-old, 12-year-old, 15-year-old,
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:59.640]   you've got the world of Pimsleur
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.640]   and all the wonderful kind of adult language programs.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.000]   Those are great, but not for children.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.960]   They're just too, children aren't that interested.
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:11.240]   But you can find them good input and they can be interested.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.640]   And then you can use media.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:16.040]   I'm convinced, I've heard enough stories.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.000]   First of all, if you go around the world
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.340]   and you find somebody who is not a native English speaker,
[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:23.720]   but who speaks English very well,
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.400]   with a very clear and understandable accent,
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.840]   with smooth, with excellent prosody, et cetera,
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.940]   and you ask them how they learned it,
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:34.240]   80% of the time, they're gonna say something about,
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.480]   well, I watched a lot of American TV, right?
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.680]   I watched "Friends" all the time.
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:39.840]   And all around the world,
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.720]   there are people who just speak perfect English,
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:44.760]   and they get that way through a lot of media exposure
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.300]   to the English language.
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:50.680]   The same exact thing works in reverse if you want it to.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.120]   I've heard plenty of stories, people who,
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:57.280]   one story that Steven Krashen tells
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:00.120]   is how he worked with somebody who spoke perfect Mandarin.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.240]   And the way he learned Mandarin was they had,
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:05.700]   his family had a Mandarin-speaking housekeeper
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.740]   that would come to the house to clean the house,
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:11.360]   and she would put on cartoons in Mandarin for the boy,
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.160]   and the boy wanted to see what was in the cartoons,
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.480]   and eventually he learned Mandarin.
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.080]   He didn't care about learning Mandarin.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.520]   He never wanted to learn Mandarin.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.960]   He never had lessons in Mandarin.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.160]   He wanted to watch the cartoons,
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.680]   but this happened for years and years.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.480]   And as an adult, he could go to China,
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.320]   he could speak Mandarin.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.720]   He couldn't read or write, but he could speak Mandarin.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:27.800]   And then when he left China,
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.040]   he never even thought about Mandarin.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.640]   It just was there for him because he watched cartoons.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:35.480]   And so if you expose your children to enough media,
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:36.840]   they can learn the language.
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:37.840]   It'll just happen.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.400]   It may not happen in the most efficient manner possible,
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:45.600]   but it will happen in the fullness of time.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.040]   And so think back now
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.160]   to some of my harsh and critical comments
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.480]   that I have made in previous episodes
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.720]   when I was talking about the value of literature
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.440]   and words, et cetera,
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.320]   and I was saying how if you want your children
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:58.440]   to be really good at English,
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.480]   you wanna read to them a lot,
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.520]   you want them to read a lot
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.000]   'cause that's where they develop their vocabulary
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:02.840]   and their grammar,
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.560]   and I was saying how it's more efficient, et cetera.
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:09.660]   All of the stuff that is a negative
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:13.160]   with regard to your native language of English
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.960]   now becomes a positive with studying a foreign language.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:20.840]   So if you're going to have your children play with apps,
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.400]   if you're gonna stick an iPad in your three-year-old's hand,
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:25.920]   at least put the iPad in Indonesian.
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:29.320]   Your child's gonna figure it out.
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.000]   There's those cool studies where they took,
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.360]   I can't remember who to cite on it,
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.600]   but there was a story where they took a computer
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.120]   and they stuck it in an African village
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.480]   where nobody spoke English
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.740]   and they didn't give any instructions.
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:41.120]   They just stuck it there and turned it on.
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.600]   And they came back some months later
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.480]   and the children were learning English.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.480]   They were accessing all the websites and everything,
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.480]   and they just figured it out.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:48.380]   Children figure it out.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.800]   So just, if you wanna have something fun,
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.980]   just go and take your child's iPad and stick it in Chinese
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:56.760]   and walk away and don't tell them how to change it back.
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:59.440]   And in the fullness of time, they'll figure it out.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.820]   So you can do this, right?
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:03.580]   There's an interesting Spanish YouTuber that I watch,
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:06.180]   and he himself is multilingual.
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:08.680]   I think he speaks six or seven languages.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:13.280]   And he and his wife have this strategy with their daughter.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.120]   And he speaks Swiss German with his daughter.
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.120]   His wife speaks Spanish.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.040]   They speak English with other friends.
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:22.280]   The cartoons are always in Italian,
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.040]   and the iPad is in Portuguese, something like that.
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.800]   So you can use this in that way.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.920]   You can also use movies.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.620]   This is something that I've tested out.
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.720]   For a long time, we did no movies.
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.960]   And then I started showing my children movies
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.760]   for a variety of reasons.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.120]   And then I said,
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.080]   instead of just showing the movies in English,
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:44.640]   why don't I just use this as a foreign language opportunity?
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.080]   And so in the beginning,
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.440]   I would show the movie in English,
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.600]   and then a couple weeks later, we'd repeat the movie,
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.560]   and I'd put it in a foreign language.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.960]   And I got a little bit of complaints
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.580]   for the first couple times,
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.480]   and then they just saw that if we're gonna watch a movie,
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.720]   this is the way it is.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.340]   And so at this point in time,
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:04.020]   they don't complain about it anymore.
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:05.320]   If I say we're gonna watch a movie,
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:06.280]   then they say, oh, great.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.720]   And they ask what language it's gonna be in,
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.480]   and I tell them what language.
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.260]   Recently, I have stopped even bothering
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:14.980]   to show the movie in English the first time around.
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:17.600]   And I just show it now in foreign languages.
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.560]   And I'm not committed to that all the time,
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.040]   because I think movies are wonderful, right?
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.480]   It's nice to have things that are in your native language,
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.840]   and really beautiful movies, great.
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:28.120]   But we often consume a lot of just fluff movies
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.040]   that aren't really great art pieces.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.640]   They're just filling the time.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.040]   Might as well put the time to good use.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:36.280]   And so I've played around with doing foreign language dubbing
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.440]   and also foreign language subtitles.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.400]   I've pretty well settled on that the best solution
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:44.040]   is to just play it with a foreign language track
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:46.880]   and play it with English subtitles.
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:50.680]   There's data that's cited in Jim Trulisa's book
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.200]   called "The Read Aloud Handbook,"
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.760]   where he identifies, I think there was research
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:56.400]   that was done in Finland,
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:59.200]   where they found that some of the Finnish schoolchildren
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.600]   were advanced readers.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:04.360]   And the reason they figured that was happening
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:08.940]   is that because the nation was so small
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:13.100]   and had so little native language content,
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:18.480]   most of the media that was coming in on the TV station
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.080]   would be in a foreign language,
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.880]   but it would all be subtitled in Finnish.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:26.760]   And so the children had lots of chances
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:29.480]   to improve their reading speed and reading skill
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:31.600]   by reading subtitles constantly.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.520]   And so I think that this can be another tool
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:35.480]   in your toolbox.
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:36.840]   Put on the subtitles,
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.520]   and especially what's in a foreign language,
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.560]   the child wants to know what's going on.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.440]   So the child will read the subtitles,
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:44.240]   that's improving reading ability,
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:47.000]   and also will over time be able to understand
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.760]   the foreign language more effectively.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.720]   And then even when we come to the topic of books,
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:55.920]   in my tradition where we talk about Charlotte Mason
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.200]   and living books and whatnot,
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.160]   we use this word twaddle to refer to books
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.920]   that perhaps aren't the highest expression of excellence
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:04.840]   in that category.
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:05.920]   They're kind of repetitive
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.000]   or they're kind of amateurish or childish
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.680]   or not super awesome.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.040]   But what's interesting is a lot of the twaddle
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:15.040]   that we would call in our foreign language,
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.320]   the reasons we call it twaddle,
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.880]   it actually becomes a benefit in a foreign language.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:20.760]   I think I mixed up my words.
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.440]   The stuff that in our native language,
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.000]   we wouldn't want our children to read
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.720]   because it's just beneath them,
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:30.040]   in a foreign language now becomes really, really useful.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:34.120]   And so we can take something that is,
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.000]   for example, series books,
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.440]   and just put them in a foreign language.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.960]   And all that stuff, the simplified vocabulary,
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.520]   the simplified plots, et cetera,
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:45.480]   that can be a negative to your child
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:48.280]   achieving a really high level of literacy
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.640]   in his native language,
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.920]   but it's now a positive in the foreign language.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:54.320]   That the repetition or the low level vocabulary
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.260]   is really useful because it makes it easier
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:59.080]   to learn that foreign language.
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:02.520]   At its key, you want to measure the number of hours
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.880]   of exposure that your child has.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:07.440]   You want to expose your child to comprehensible input,
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.680]   something that they can understand,
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:11.120]   either through context, through translation, et cetera.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:14.880]   And you want to maximize the number of hours.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.680]   The way I do it, I don't test my children
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.520]   on their languages.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.720]   I don't force anything.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.560]   All I do is try to create the best,
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.360]   compelling, comprehensible input I can have.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.980]   And then I require them to be exposed to it
[01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:28.040]   in moderate amounts.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.440]   I don't want to be a hard taskmaster.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:30.800]   I don't want to require hours and hours.
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:32.200]   I don't want to poison the well.
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.120]   And then associate that learning Chinese
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.600]   is something that stinks because it's just
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.200]   hours and hours all day.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:39.240]   So I keep it in short little bite-sized segments,
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.900]   stick it in all over the place.
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:43.160]   But the goal is just to accumulate those hours.
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.600]   Accumulate those 600 hours, those 1,000 hours,
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.680]   those 2,000 hours, et cetera.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.640]   You want to just start the clock working
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.200]   towards those hours.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:54.440]   And then watch to see kind of what's working, what's not.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:56.480]   Find other resources, et cetera.
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:59.000]   And then when possible, supplement with
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.960]   some form of immersion opportunity.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:04.720]   At the moment, in my home for the last couple of weeks,
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:09.720]   and this week, I have a German tutor staying with us.
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:13.140]   My children have been being exposed to German,
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:14.600]   but they haven't had any chance to speak it.
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:15.700]   I can't speak it with them.
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:17.640]   I don't have a good opportunity.
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:20.480]   And so I basically have an au pair
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:22.120]   who's in our home for a few weeks.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:25.240]   And it gives an opportunity for German immersion
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.240]   in the home.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.220]   So we're doing a German intensive.
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:30.180]   We watch a German movie every night,
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:34.520]   which helps a lot to have language exposure
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.840]   for my youngest ones who aren't super interested at all
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:41.040]   in the lessons.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.640]   The older ones are doing most of their reading in German,
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:44.460]   listening in German.
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:46.240]   And then we have the conversation opportunity.
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.120]   And I've just been amazed that,
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.200]   let me get my timing right,
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:54.240]   nine months ago, we had no German exposure.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:59.160]   And today, my eldest can naturally and fluently
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:02.000]   converse in a normal way in the German language.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.080]   But it came after lots of exposure
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.880]   and then having an activation opportunity,
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.600]   an immersion activation opportunity.
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:12.920]   I have other podcasts in the backlog
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:15.640]   where I've talked about methods and in detail.
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:18.400]   So I'm intentionally avoiding an in-depth conversation
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.640]   here on the methods of language acquisition.
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.440]   I wanna tell you any method can work,
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:23.980]   just basically exposure.
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:26.400]   And there's probably no bad method.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.440]   It's just a matter of finding things
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:32.200]   that balance that metric between pleasure
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.520]   and kind of one of the child wanting to do it,
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:35.480]   not pushing too much,
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.400]   but making sure that there's an exposure
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:40.060]   and then consistency and diligence over time.
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:43.560]   If you can repeat the process multiple times,
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:47.760]   again, over enough days, enough weeks, enough years,
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.300]   you can make tremendous progress
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:50.880]   and it gets better and better.
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.600]   Years ago, I remember listening to,
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:56.360]   who knows, may have been Zig Ziglar or Brian Tracy,
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:00.400]   some of my motivational speaker heroes.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.280]   And one of them made a comment and said,
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:07.320]   how many languages can a child learn?
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:10.280]   And the answer was, well, as many as you could teach them.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:13.280]   And I thought, yeah, that's cool, that's pretty cool.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.840]   We should teach our children more.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:15.760]   Then I had children
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:18.040]   and I had no idea how to teach child language.
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:21.120]   And I just felt like, maybe that was nonsense.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.720]   So today I have figured out
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:25.160]   and learned how to teach a child a language.
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:28.360]   And so what I say is that your child
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:31.320]   cannot learn as many as you can teach him.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.920]   Rather, he can learn as many as you can teach him
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.640]   and have the time to do it.
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.360]   So I think there is probably a pretty obvious cutoff
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:45.040]   with the number of languages that your child can master
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.080]   and can maintain over time.
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:48.560]   And I'm gonna guess that that number
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.160]   is somewhere between 10 and 20.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.960]   I think 12 is pretty doable.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.000]   15 starts to get questionable.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.840]   Maybe it's as high as 20.
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:00.160]   But if you look at some of the very experienced,
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:02.320]   motivated polyglots that are out there,
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:07.720]   you recognize that it becomes challenging
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:11.760]   to maintain a huge number of languages
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.360]   to the level that you would like.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.400]   There are noted polyglots
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:19.160]   who have studied 50, 60, 70 languages, proven.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.520]   Not the old ones where it was just fake,
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.720]   or we didn't have good records, but today, proven.
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:26.120]   And it's easier to be a polyglot today
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.200]   than it's ever been before
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.360]   because of the modern technologies
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:31.520]   where we can access these languages,
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.800]   we can access the materials,
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.680]   we can access all this great stuff.
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.560]   So it's easier today to be a polyglot
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.560]   than it ever was before.
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:43.560]   But it's hard to keep them all current
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:46.760]   and to have enough time to invest into all of them.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.280]   And languages need to be maintained
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:52.680]   in order to keep them ready and usable.
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:55.920]   And so I'm gonna guess that the number
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:59.000]   that you probably couldn't really go beyond it
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.720]   is probably in that range, again, 10 to 20.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.440]   And again, not that you can't go beyond it,
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:07.040]   I think you can, but in terms of a child
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.280]   who may not be motivated.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.880]   Now, if you have a child who's motivated
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:10.840]   to be his own polyglot,
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:13.240]   yeah, you can go ahead and add another 10 on.
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:15.520]   And just like, think about that Canadian guy
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:18.200]   who his children from birth are speaking five languages.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.760]   If he also embraced other things
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:23.960]   and added in more languages, he could go a lot farther.
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.700]   But there is a limit.
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:27.600]   The cool thing is that most of us
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.920]   are nowhere near that limit.
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.080]   I'm not at the limit yet.
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.640]   I'm guessing we've started some of the harder ones.
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:39.200]   Yes, the classical languages, I started Chinese recently.
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.240]   And so these are a big time commitment.
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:44.960]   It's 2200 hours is a lot more time than 600 hours.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.480]   And so we'll see what happens in the fullness of time.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:49.080]   We're not at that limit yet.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.880]   And I'm guessing that most of us are not.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:55.600]   So if you look at what is possible,
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.800]   and then you come back, I hope it can inspire you
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.960]   that it is much more feasible than you might have thought.
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:03.000]   If I think back to how hard I thought it was
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000]   to teach my children Spanish,
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.720]   today I don't think it's hard.
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:10.180]   And this is where I wanna actually end.
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:13.920]   One of the things that you need to control for yourself
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:15.840]   as a parent and also for your children
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.680]   is the beliefs that they have around studying languages.
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:23.240]   First, you need to think about your own beliefs.
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:26.200]   Do you believe that learning a language is hard?
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.720]   I used to believe that.
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:28.860]   I no longer do.
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:31.240]   I don't think that learning a language is hard.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:32.160]   It's not hard.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:35.480]   Your brain is wired to learn language.
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:39.120]   It's just slower than you would like it to be.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:42.120]   And it's frustrating because you would like
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.520]   to be able to remember that new word you learned
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.080]   the first time you hear it.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:48.960]   But realistically, you probably need to hear it 10, 15,
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:51.280]   20 times in order to remember it.
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.680]   So if you accept the fact that you need to hear a word
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:57.940]   10, 15, 20 times, read a word 10, 15, 20 times,
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:00.880]   maybe 30 times before you remember it,
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:02.400]   just recognize it's not hard.
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.680]   It's just a matter of getting in the reps,
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:08.520]   getting your way there, working towards it.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:11.640]   And so if you think it's hard,
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:13.760]   you can give that belief to your children.
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:16.400]   But if you can cut out that belief for yourself,
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.560]   language learning is not hard.
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.320]   You can cut it out for your children.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:22.800]   So I have successfully cut out the belief to my children
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.200]   language learning is hard.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.720]   It's just something they do.
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:27.560]   What about language learning is not fun?
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.480]   Well, certainly we can all acknowledge
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:31.920]   that we all have different definitions of fun.
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:34.480]   And you may have yours and I may have mine,
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.260]   but I genuinely enjoy it.
[01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:38.360]   I consider it an enjoyable thing to do
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:41.760]   that is fun in the way that a workout is fun.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:44.000]   You go and you lift heavy weights,
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.120]   or you go on a long walk, or you go on a hike,
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:49.160]   and there's times in it when you're hurting,
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.800]   but you feel good when you're done.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.320]   And I think language learning is an appropriate form
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:55.120]   of mental exercise.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:56.780]   If you remember what I said
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:58.720]   when I talked in the math episode,
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:03.240]   if we're designing a perfect life, quote unquote,
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:05.220]   for ourselves and for our children,
[01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:06.380]   I think there are some things
[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:07.960]   that are gonna be a part of it.
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.920]   There's a whole, a perfect day is gonna,
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:14.620]   a perfect day physically is gonna have high quality food,
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:17.520]   high quality extended rest.
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:18.560]   You know, no alarm clocks.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.360]   You're gonna sleep until you're not tired,
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:22.280]   and you're gonna wake up, and you're gonna have good sleep.
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:24.000]   So lots of sleep, good sleep.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.120]   High quality food, high quality air,
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.360]   high quality water, clean water, lots of it.
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:31.960]   You're gonna get lots of sunshine.
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:35.540]   You're gonna get lots of action, activity, movement.
[01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:36.580]   You're gonna sweat.
[01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:37.460]   You're gonna work.
[01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:38.460]   You're gonna work your heart.
[01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:39.880]   You're gonna work your muscles.
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.200]   You might work your balance.
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.120]   You might stretch.
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:43.320]   You might, those kinds of things.
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.680]   Or you can go down a list of all the physical things
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:48.180]   that lead into a perfect day.
[01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:50.600]   You can go down then the list of all of the mental things
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:51.620]   that lead to a perfect day.
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:54.400]   So you want your brain to work.
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:57.480]   So a good day is probably gonna include some math,
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.120]   make your brain really, really work,
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.440]   get a good math workout in,
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:02.680]   work on a hard problem that you don't know how to do.
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:03.720]   That's really good.
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:07.200]   A good day is gonna involve some foreign language study,
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:08.720]   some vocabulary acquisition,
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:10.120]   kind of keep that flexibility
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.120]   and plasticity going in your brain.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:17.120]   A good day is gonna involve dwelling on some high thoughts,
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:19.820]   something inspiring, something motivating,
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:22.360]   a great story, something that inspires you,
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:24.440]   something that touches your emotions.
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.920]   A good day is gonna involve some instruction,
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:30.680]   feeding yourself with useful advice or instruction
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:32.980]   around some challenge that you're facing.
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:36.320]   A good day is going to involve a range of emotions,
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:41.320]   feeling love, feeling joy, feeling laughter, right?
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:43.640]   Laughing together with those that you love,
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.680]   having jokes, et cetera.
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:50.000]   These are all components of keeping your mind appropriate.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.120]   And then you can explore the spirit, right?
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:55.920]   The spiritual side of dwelling on something
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:59.420]   that is beautiful, looking at a beautiful tree,
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:01.040]   looking at a beautiful landscape,
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.840]   looking at a beautiful piece of art,
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.680]   dwelling on something that touches your soul like music,
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.480]   playing a beautiful song
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:12.900]   or singing something that is uplifting,
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:14.800]   dwelling on a beautiful thought,
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:20.080]   meditating on the person of God or the love of God
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:24.780]   or the goodness of your neighbor
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:27.000]   or whatever it is that uplifts you.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:32.000]   And so if you made a checklist of those 10, 15, 20 things
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:37.800]   and on any given day, you had five, 10, 15 of them done,
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:40.120]   you get together a long string of good days
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:45.120]   and you see improvements across all of those factors,
[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:47.920]   physical, mental, spiritual improvements.
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:50.360]   I think that's the basic outline for children.
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.380]   That's how their life should be.
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:55.440]   We have physical, mental and spiritual nourishment
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.640]   on a daily basis.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.120]   And we build an environment
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:01.420]   in which their bodies are stretched and recovered,
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:06.160]   meaning they're nourished with rest
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:08.360]   and they're stretched with activity,
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:11.400]   where their brains are nourished with rest
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.240]   and they're stretched with activity
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:15.720]   and their spirits are nourished with rest
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:17.440]   and they're stretched with activity.
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.920]   And that process is very,
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:23.420]   that's what it means to be human, that sense of growth.
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:26.000]   And so languages are a tool in the toolbox
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.040]   to stretch your brain, make you smarter,
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:29.520]   make your children smarter.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:32.100]   They're not hard, no language is hard.
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.820]   It may be dissimilar, right?
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:36.760]   A language like Chinese is not hard, it's just dissimilar.
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:39.180]   Every language has its complex things.
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:43.060]   Spanish is a crazy easy language to learn,
[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:44.060]   but to learn it well,
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:47.100]   you have to learn these complex conjugations,
[01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:48.780]   which are often challenging
[01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:53.740]   for non-native Spanish speakers, but they're not hard.
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:55.180]   You get used to them over time
[01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:58.080]   and then they tend to flow fairly naturally,
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:33:59.500]   but they're just dissimilar.
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:00.460]   Same thing with Chinese.
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:02.900]   Chinese has things that are dissimilar from English,
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:05.020]   the tonal system, the characters,
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:07.200]   but it doesn't have a whole bunch
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.500]   of those challenging features of Spanish.
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:11.500]   It doesn't have the complex conjugation charts, et cetera.
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.460]   Even if you get into the complex languages
[01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:16.140]   and the declension tables of Latin and Greek, et cetera,
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:18.380]   they're not hard, they're just dissimilar.
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:19.420]   And it takes time.
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.540]   And if you can build pleasure into the routine,
[01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:24.100]   then it can be part of it.
[01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:26.700]   And then back to kind of what your children say
[01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:28.100]   or what your children think.
[01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:29.340]   One of the things that I try to do
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:31.860]   is I try to control the environment of my children
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.180]   and brainwash them for positive thinking.
[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:37.300]   So when I first set out on this three and a half years ago,
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:38.620]   I decided I was gonna do it.
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:39.780]   We started to teach Spanish.
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:40.620]   And then I thought,
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:42.460]   and as I researched and researched and researched,
[01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:45.380]   and I realized that my vision was so low,
[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:49.540]   then I found examples of people
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:51.380]   who had succeeded at a very high level.
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:53.180]   I found, I've forgotten her name, Bella, I think,
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:54.580]   the little Russian girl that,
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:57.740]   you know, there's this great clip of her
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:00.340]   speaking seven languages on national TV.
[01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:02.940]   I recounted the stories of various polyglots
[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:05.020]   who speak 15, 20 languages.
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:08.620]   And so when you surround yourself with that,
[01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:10.140]   you recognize, wow,
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:12.500]   to learn two or three languages is not that difficult.
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.280]   And then I try to cut out all the negative influence.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:16.300]   I surround them with people who are multilingual.
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:17.940]   Just talk about multilingual.
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:19.820]   Look, this person over here speaks four languages.
[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:20.660]   Very natural.
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:22.460]   And in fact, that was the other point I wanted to make
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:26.020]   is that on the whole, multilingualism is something
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:28.700]   that is very natural and normal for human beings.
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:31.420]   All around the world, there are societies
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:35.800]   in which it's completely normal and expected
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:38.820]   that you speak three, four, five, or more languages.
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:40.040]   These are distinct languages.
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:42.900]   You can find this in various tribal regions
[01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:44.740]   that going back many, many thousands of years,
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:47.700]   this just intense multilingualism, and even today.
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:51.100]   So the concept of being monolingual
[01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:56.000]   is much more unusual as a modern aberration
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.020]   than the concept of being multilingual.
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:35:59.460]   So just don't buy the lies.
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:01.500]   And even if you're not quite sure,
[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:05.660]   it's very healthy for you to adopt a mindset
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:08.500]   where this isn't hard.
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:10.740]   This is totally doable.
[01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:12.020]   Learning a language is not hard.
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:12.980]   It's just dissimilar.
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:14.020]   It just takes time.
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:15.500]   I just need to get my thousand hours done.
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:17.500]   And when I get my thousand hours done, we're good.
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.280]   And so what can I do in those thousand hours
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:20.460]   that I'm gonna really enjoy?
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:22.740]   What can I, how can I do this
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:25.220]   where I'm enjoying the act of doing it?
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:27.140]   This is on every level.
[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:29.860]   People who work a lot, they find pleasure in their work.
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:30.980]   People who work out a lot,
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:32.820]   they find pleasure in working out.
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:37.820]   And so we look to see how is this pleasurable
[01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:39.580]   and then that affects our results.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.260]   And we should give that to our children.
[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:42.920]   So in the same way I talked about exercise,
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:44.420]   that I don't want my children to ever think
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:47.380]   that exercise is a punishment,
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:50.340]   but rather the joy of exercise is the joy of exercise.
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:52.740]   It feels good to take your shoes off
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:54.460]   and run across the yard in the sunshine.
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:55.300]   It feels good.
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:56.940]   Every child naturally does that.
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:58.580]   So I don't wanna turn that into something
[01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:01.340]   that is a work that has to be done
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:03.420]   and it's somehow a penalty.
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:06.180]   I want it to always feel good and I wanna nurture that.
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:09.740]   It feels good to learn your first language.
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:12.580]   Babies love it and they just naturally learn it.
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:15.020]   And in the same way, it feels good to learn
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:17.620]   the second language and the third language, et cetera.
[01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:20.340]   And as you start to get that positive feedback of that,
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:21.580]   to be able to talk with more people,
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:23.940]   to be able to absorb more literature,
[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:25.460]   you get the admiration of other people,
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:28.740]   it becomes a virtuous cycle that continues itself.
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:31.740]   And so all of these things that we want our children
[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:36.740]   to acquire, it feels good to do them.
[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:39.980]   And I just think we should be careful
[01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:42.360]   about introducing negative emotional baggage
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.300]   when it's just not necessary.
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:49.300]   If you reinterpret sensations in a different way,
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:53.980]   it can help with a completely different mindset.
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:55.300]   I wanna give one more example
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:56.860]   'cause I think this is a powerful example.
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:58.380]   Recently on a Q&A show,
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:00.140]   someone was asking about pregnancy
[01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:03.260]   and I was describing the basic mechanics of childbirth.
[01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:05.140]   And my wife and I came up with a concept
[01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:07.140]   that we found really helpful, she found helpful,
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:08.380]   we found it, I think it's helpful,
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:11.020]   but I haven't ever given birth, of course.
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:13.500]   But we came up with a concept that we found really helpful
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:16.260]   is that once we understood, with our first baby,
[01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:19.780]   once we understood the basic mechanics of childbirth,
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:22.740]   what is labor, what is a contraction, et cetera,
[01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:27.740]   we just talked about it in the context of reworking it
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:31.320]   in the context of a muscular experience.
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.620]   We had been raised, like most people,
[01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:38.620]   our only experience of childbirth
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:40.940]   is watching some random TV program
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:43.380]   of a woman lying on her back screaming her head off.
[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:45.380]   And this puts all these images in your mind.
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:47.980]   But what's interesting is people scream their heads off
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:50.260]   in all kinds of circumstances, but it's very different.
[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:55.260]   And so we came to talk about childbirth and contractions
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:58.500]   as kind of like a heavy workout.
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:38:59.980]   And you know when you go in the gym
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:03.140]   and you lift heavy weights, it hurts, right?
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:05.940]   Your muscles scream and it hurts.
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:07.380]   Or if you find some weightlifter,
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:09.700]   go find a video of Ronnie Coleman working out
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:13.160]   and it hurts and he's screaming, it hurts.
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:16.200]   But because there's a context for the pain,
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.320]   you understand that this is a muscular pain
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:19.840]   that's gonna go away soon,
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.160]   your brain has a way to deal with it that's very healthy.
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:23.660]   And people that go to the gym all the time,
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:25.200]   they get addicted to the pain.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:27.560]   They don't like the pain, they like the results.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:30.380]   And so when we kind of talked about
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:35.380]   the muscular experience of childbirth in that way,
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:38.440]   it doesn't diminish necessarily the pain,
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:40.800]   although there's things you can do to diminish the pain,
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.360]   but it reinterprets it.
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:45.520]   And so I try to talk with my children about this
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.680]   with regard to doing hard things,
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:50.680]   math, language study, writing, whatever the hard thing is,
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:52.680]   that we do these hard things
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.840]   because it helps us to get stronger.
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:58.000]   And this is pleasurable because it's a growth opportunity
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.240]   to allows us to grow as humans.
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:04.080]   So language learning is not hard, you're wired for it.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:06.040]   We do it naturally and easily,
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:08.460]   every baby around the world does it.
[01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:10.120]   It's just time consuming.
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:13.480]   And it's hard to sometimes to accumulate the materials
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:14.440]   that you're gonna connect with.
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.360]   And sometimes it's boring.
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.860]   It's boring for a few hundred hours
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:19.680]   till you can get to your native level materials,
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:20.980]   but it's not hard.
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:22.600]   So if you're interested in teaching your children
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:24.840]   to be multilingual, just recognize you can do it.
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.280]   There's lots of ways to do it.
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.120]   The most important thing is not the method.
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:30.180]   The most important thing is the desire
[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:32.400]   and having the sufficient time.
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:34.960]   So start early and go from there.
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:36.420]   It's only hard the first time,
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:37.960]   it's only hard until you do it.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:39.840]   Once you do it, you look back and you say,
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:42.160]   that was easy, but it's hard until you do it.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.360]   So press through and do it.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:45.960]   Things you can spend money on here,
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:48.760]   obviously you can spend money on courses,
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:50.320]   you can spend money on materials,
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.200]   you can spend money on tutors,
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.240]   you can spend money on schools.
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:59.060]   All of those are good and useful things to spend money on.
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:02.360]   I productively spend, I would estimate,
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:03.520]   I had to go back and check my records,
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:06.240]   but probably a few hundred dollars a month,
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:07.920]   varying obviously depending on
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:10.240]   if I've got a tutor in the home
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:12.680]   or if I'm buying a bunch of books
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:15.120]   or if I have courses, I have some app subscriptions
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:17.400]   and courses, et cetera.
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:18.880]   But it's definitely easy to spend
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:21.480]   a few hundred dollars a month very productively.
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:25.000]   But the key is not always the money, it is the time.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.280]   So recognize that.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:29.160]   Thanks for listening, I'll be back with you very soon.

[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:40.360]   It's nature trails draped in stately oaks,
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.240]   restaurants with water views,
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:44.580]   and waterways where dolphins play.
