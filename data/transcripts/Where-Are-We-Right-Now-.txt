[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.560]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.280]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.280]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.280]   I am your host.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.440]   Today I'm struggling with something that I don't generally struggle with, namely how
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.640]   to start a podcast.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.600]   Usually it comes fairly easy to me, but I'm struggling to know how to begin today because
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.440]   the actual topics that I want to talk about are a little fuzzy in my head still.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.560]   So I don't know what to do other than just begin.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.840]   So let's talk about where things are right now.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.840]   I would imagine that if you are anything like me, you're looking around at the world and
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.440]   are concerned about where we go from here.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.160]   Over the past days as I have watched the current world events, I have chatted privately with
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.400]   friends and I've just said, "Where do we go from here?
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.760]   Where's the exit ramp?
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.440]   What's the next thing?"
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.120]   And for clarity, of course, I'm recording this on June 4, 2020, and there are three
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:15.920]   large scale, very impactful circumstances that are impacting our lives.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.960]   So of course, a big one, coronavirus, the worldwide global coronavirus epidemic, pandemic,
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.600]   excuse me, is certainly affecting all of our lives to some degree or another.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.160]   Now that effect is markedly different depending on your residence in a place like the United
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:45.040]   States or Brazil as compared to your residence in a place like New Zealand or Singapore.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.040]   These are very different experiences of the coronavirus pandemic at the moment, but all
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.840]   of us are being impacted by the coronavirus epidemic.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.460]   The tone that I sense right now with regard to coronavirus is a tone of optimism.
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:11.380]   The general consensus seems to increasingly be that the actual fatality rate of coronavirus
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.160]   infection is much, much lower than previously feared.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.120]   Now that fatality rate varies tremendously in different countries, and as always, the
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.560]   data is never as complete as you would like it to be.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.240]   But it does seem that we are improving with our ability to handle the actual sickness
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.400]   that somebody's experienced and give them better treatments.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.600]   And the other thing is we have an increasing confidence that there's a higher infection
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.720]   rate than previously assumed.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.280]   Now the case fatality rate is still extraordinarily high on a global basis, but that should continue
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.120]   to come down.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.960]   And yet I still take the situation very seriously.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.040]   I still don't want to get coronavirus.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.160]   I still would prefer to not get it.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.520]   I'm still taking significant precautions, and I think that those are wise, especially
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.980]   for people who are at higher risk.
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.200]   But there is, of course, the coronavirus pandemic.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.560]   That's one thing that's large and concerning, and it's going to be with us for a very long
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.560]   time.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.840]   Now the second order of effects, kind of the second situation that flows naturally from
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.120]   coronavirus is, of course, the economic situation that we're in, which is truly dire.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.000]   It's truly devastating.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.200]   It's truly awful.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.360]   And here again, your experience of this economic crisis varies greatly depending on where you
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.640]   are and at what social class you are.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.920]   One of the things that I was wrong about a few months ago is I thought that the coronavirus
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:58.120]   epidemic and the associated lockdowns would flat out destroy everything.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.840]   I was in the mindset of kind of global depression for many years.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.440]   And yet I think that the effects are going to be less severe, less severe than I previously
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.440]   feared.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.880]   And the basic reason for that is the revolution in telecommunication and the ability for so
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.920]   many of us to telework, to work through an internet connection.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.120]   That's truly astounding.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.200]   If we were living in the world of a century ago, where we all needed to be physically
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.880]   present in an office, and if we were facing the kinds of lockdowns and restrictions that
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.880]   so many countries have put in place, then it truly would have been that bad.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.200]   But many of us, especially many of us who are very high productivity people, can still
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.320]   work through a phone and an internet connection, which is really remarkable.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:56.720]   The people who are hurt the most by the lockdowns tend to be those who are overall lower productivity
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.320]   people, people who are working lower income jobs, physical labor jobs, et cetera.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.280]   That's not universally true, but it does seem to be generally true.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.920]   So much of our work has become knowledge work that now many of us can work from anywhere
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.680]   in the world, and that has allowed us to stay highly productive.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.640]   Most professionals that I interact with have continued to be highly productive during their
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.960]   times of isolation.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.400]   Now there are legions of businesses that have been hurt, obviously restaurant businesses,
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.740]   hospitality businesses, airlines.
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:37.200]   And so it's not right to make a totally wide sweeping statement, but it's less severe than
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   I thought.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.400]   That said, it is still dire.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.680]   Best estimates are that currently unemployment in the United States is something like 20%.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:54.120]   And of course, that impacts people differently depending on where they actually are in the
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.520]   overall social stratum and in terms of the kind of job that they have.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.080]   Unfortunately the people who are hit hard by unemployment are those who don't make a
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.520]   lot in the first place, but still with unemployment benefits in the United States, with the extra
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.620]   unemployment benefits, the effects are still somewhat modest for those who were employed.
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:25.040]   If you were to compare those effects versus say, people living in Mexico or Guatemala
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.160]   who are in lockdowns and who are experiencing massive increases in unemployment just due
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.160]   to the lockdowns, total social lockdowns, and yet they don't have the social safety
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.400]   net, the unemployment payments and the generous unemployment payments and the extra unemployment
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.240]   payments, et cetera.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.440]   It's just so much more devastating in a country like that than it has been in the United States
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.520]   or Canada or the UK.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:57.280]   So the economic effects truly are dire and those are being felt.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.600]   News is now that defaults are up as would be expected.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.240]   Late payments are increasing as would be expected.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.460]   And I think that there was a lot of hope a few weeks ago that things would get back to
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.080]   normal fairly quickly.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.800]   There was a lot of hope that everything was looking better and better on coronavirus.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.760]   We're lifting restrictions and everything seemed like it was going to perhaps be back
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.020]   to normal a little bit faster.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:31.640]   Which brings us now to the more current events of the social unrest, especially in the United
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.480]   States, but to some degree around the world.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.720]   This is certainly not a global situation of social unrest, although there are some global
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:47.440]   manifestations with the riots in the wake of the killing in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.280]   And as I've been thinking about this, it's so fascinating to consider whether to connect
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.720]   this to the coronavirus epidemic or not.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:03.640]   I think an honest analysis would have to say that this could properly be characterized
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:09.440]   as almost a third order effect of the coronavirus epidemic.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:15.320]   It's hard for me to imagine that you would be seeing what you're seeing right now on
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.760]   the news or wherever you get your sources of information.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:24.400]   It's hard for me to imagine that you'd be seeing that if there were not so much stored
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:32.560]   up tension related to coronavirus and all of the associated restrictions and lockdowns.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.820]   It's also interesting to think about if things would be as vigorous in terms of the number
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:45.480]   of people protesting, the number of people looting and rioting, if there weren't so many
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.200]   economic problems, if people had more employment.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.320]   One of the interesting things is that many times when you see protests, you'll often
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.480]   see them, they'll work on the weekend, but if you get to a Monday, people don't exactly
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.640]   have a lot of time to protest.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:06.840]   Well, when you pour a volatile situation into a world in which people have more time to
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:12.080]   protest and possibly even more income still coming in because I'm unemployed, what else
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.340]   do I have to do?
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:18.160]   It makes for a very volatile mix.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:25.760]   This situation seems different to me than it has in the past.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:33.440]   Don't know where we go from here, but things seem different to me than it has in the past.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.160]   First of course, although police shootings and police shootings of black people have
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:47.200]   gained widespread publicity and support in years past, it's certainly never been as widespread
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.240]   as they are right now in terms of the amount of support.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:58.880]   I think that that's got to affect the people involved with the protests, all of the associated
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.440]   marches and political movements, et cetera.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:07.640]   I think it's going to be a significant effect that will make that continue.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:15.600]   On the other hand, I think it's tremendously dangerous that the entire movement is very
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:22.660]   likely going to continue to be co-opted and corrupted by violent elements.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:30.040]   With every day that goes by, it seems as though the risk of that just rises day by day.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:36.640]   Then that means that there will be continuing crackdowns by police, by military officials,
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:42.880]   et cetera, to stop the rioting, to stop the looting, to stop the protesting itself.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.080]   It doesn't make a good mix.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.400]   It doesn't make for a very peaceful mix.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.600]   Yet we're stuck with this conundrum that, again, unless you're living in a downtown
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:06.680]   area or you live in an area where you're actually been targeted by a protest site, your life
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.360]   outside the window probably looks about normal.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:17.160]   And yet your emotional life and your mental life and your social media life, most of those
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.360]   things have been rocked.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:30.720]   So it's kind of astonishing because usually you would expect a disaster to have external
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.920]   manifestations, and yet we're living through a disaster, and we're living through a series
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.840]   of disasters, and yet none of them are as immediate and none of them are as predictable
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.240]   as you might think.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.920]   You of course know that I've been concerned about many of these issues for a very long
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.520]   time.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.360]   I'm concerned about, I've been concerned about pandemics.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.960]   I haven't talked a lot about it on the show, but I've done various preparedness shows over
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.360]   the years to try to help people get ready for pandemics.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.800]   I started talking about quarantine back in January of 2020 here to try to help people
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.680]   prepare for that.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:19.720]   And the pandemic is, I think, not as bad again as previously feared, and yet the second order
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.360]   effects are truly dire.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.200]   The economic crisis is truly dire.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:32.480]   It's really severe, and we haven't really even gotten into many monetary effects.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.480]   Right now there seems to be possibly some mild deflation.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:40.120]   There's no evidence of inflation at the moment.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:48.960]   The government finances in the United States are day by day destroyed by this, but we don't
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.800]   know the actual numbers yet.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.960]   We don't know the actual figures, and we won't for a while.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.760]   And so this is going to be a very long and slow moving crisis.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:05.680]   I still don't expect any kind of, I don't expect any kind of Weimar Republic style hyperinflation.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:12.680]   I expect sort of a malaise, but this is faster and more difficult than I anticipated, which
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.760]   concerns me because I'm usually pretty pessimistic on some of this stuff.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.440]   I try to think of the worst case scenario.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:25.600]   And so when real life starts to look like more of a worst case scenario than I imagined,
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:32.160]   then that bothers me because I always want to think the worst is going to happen, and
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.720]   then of course hope for the best and then prepare for the worst.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.080]   But when situations start getting worse than I anticipated, that bothers me quite a bit
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.400]   because I don't like to go down to the depths below that of how bad it can get.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.440]   So I don't know.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.440]   I don't know.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.160]   I don't know where you go.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.800]   So I'll just tell you kind of what do you do?
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.560]   What do you do?
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.360]   I feel like a boring host when I talk about what you do because it's the same small set
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.720]   of things that you do.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.640]   And over the years, as I've thought about a lot of things, I've studied a lot of topics,
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.720]   I've studied various doomsday scenarios and considered them.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:24.160]   What I find is remarkable is you almost always wind up with about the same set of solutions.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.800]   About the same set of solutions regardless of whether somebody is, what particular disaster
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:37.240]   somebody is concerned about, a pandemic, social unrest, civil war, or versus what political
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.180]   perspective someone is coming at.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:45.460]   Somebody can be a righty, a lefty, a century, and you wind up with kind of the same set
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.440]   of solutions.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:54.440]   And so let me just talk through what I'm seeking to do and my advice for you of what to do
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.420]   at this point in time.
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:04.840]   So number one, guard your mental health, guard your psychology.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:11.680]   If you find yourself in an unstable place psychologically, pull back, pull back.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.560]   Believe it or not, you don't have to respond when someone tells you that you should.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.320]   You don't have to respond when someone tells you, "You have to do this thing."
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.960]   It's always your choice whether to respond or not.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.760]   And you should only respond to people who, you should only respond to things that line
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.760]   up with your personal goals.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:38.040]   And so you need to guard very carefully how you feel and guard your head.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:44.240]   You probably like me have lost a lot of time over the last few weeks, you know, glued to
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.160]   the internet, watching everything happening, trying to figure things out.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:55.280]   And yet, much of that time, it's largely unproductive because it gets me into a place where I'm
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.200]   not particularly useful to anybody.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:03.680]   It encourages me to move into a place of arguing with people and debating with people and it's
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.800]   not particularly healthy.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.720]   And it harms my life, harms your family, harms your health.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.880]   So guard yourself, guard yourself very carefully.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.720]   Don't let other people control your thoughts.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.640]   If other people can control your thoughts, they can control your life.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:27.680]   And you may be sovereign over nothing else in your life, but you can still be sovereign
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.880]   over your thoughts.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.660]   You may not be able to control your body.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.720]   Maybe you're locked in a prison.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.200]   Maybe you're disabled, right?
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.360]   You could be a paraplegic sitting in a wheelchair.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.880]   You may not be able to control anything external to you, but what you can always control is
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.840]   you can always control your thoughts.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.160]   And yet, that's a discipline.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.140]   It's something that we have to practice.
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.400]   It's something that we have to actively do.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.520]   And probably most of us are weak in it.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.080]   I'm certainly weak in it.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.080]   I struggle.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.680]   I struggle with that.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.720]   And yet, I'm determined to continue focusing on that.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.320]   So guard your thoughts.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.540]   Don't let other people manipulate you.
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:11.280]   Don't let other people manipulate your thoughts, manipulate your feelings, and manipulate your
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.520]   actions.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.520]   Don't be manipulated by other people.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.000]   Especially, don't be manipulated by guilt.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.280]   Somebody tries to guilt you into doing something and they use tactics of guilt on you to try
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:30.680]   to get you to say something or do something that you don't believe is right.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.280]   Just say no.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.920]   Don't let other people manipulate you.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.920]   So guard yourself.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.920]   Guard your psychology.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.360]   Focus on what you're building.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.720]   Let that focus expand out to your family.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:48.640]   One of the most important things for you to guard and to protect is your family life.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:53.360]   You must be the sentry at the door to your home that makes sure that the only things
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:59.160]   that get into the door of your home are things that are wholesome, that are good.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:06.520]   People would love to come into your home and control your environment and manipulate your
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.520]   family into their chosen course of action.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.520]   You've got to stand at the door and stop it.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.680]   And you be the one who decides what's right for your family.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.960]   And you be the one who moves your family in the right direction.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.880]   So guard your family.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.080]   Keep peace in your family relationships.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.040]   To the extent it's up to you, live at peace with all men.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.680]   But most importantly, in your family relationships.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.360]   For example, there can be these fourth order effects.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.000]   In my family, we're feeling the strain of the quarantine.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.800]   We'll go back to fourth order effects in a moment.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.920]   But in my family, we're feeling the strain of the quarantine.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.200]   And I have nothing to complain about.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.200]   We've done fine.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.560]   I don't live in a tiny apartment on the 50th floor of a high-rise.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.400]   We're not cooped up.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.440]   We have all that we need.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.600]   We're very, very fortunate.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.240]   And yet still, it's frustrating to be locked down and not be able to go places.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.240]   It's frustrating.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.960]   And the last few days, I just realized how much it was building.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.880]   And that's my responsibility to adjust that and to relieve that strain, to find ways to
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:19.280]   let that pressure go out and bring us back to a place of peace.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.880]   So pay careful attention.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:28.240]   And fourth order effects, what I was alluding to is you can have coronavirus, a strain that
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.000]   comes in because you're worried about getting sick or you're worried about your family member
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.480]   who's susceptible to the symptoms of coronavirus.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.440]   Or you're concerned about whatever it is that you're concerned about.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.480]   You're concerned.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.400]   And so the stress starts to build in your family.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.200]   And then the stress of financial stress just builds and builds.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:58.960]   And then the stress builds with social unrest and concern about the police and just goes
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.960]   on and on.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.400]   And then finally, it just boils over and you put that stress on your children.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.640]   And then all of a sudden, now your children are tense and on ease.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.840]   And that just brings back over on you and it causes the whole family to be out of rest.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:17.360]   So guard that, guard your home, make it a sanctuary, a safe place, a sanctuary where
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:23.880]   the only things that come in are the things that you've chosen to be there.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:29.240]   Financially the steps are pretty simple and it's pretty basic.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:34.800]   I continue to be conservative financially, continue to keep expenses low, continue to
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:41.560]   keep cash on hand, continue to try to keep an add to the war chest and look for investment
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.040]   opportunities, continue to try to keep income strong, continue to try to keep your business
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.920]   going as much as you can.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.540]   As I have talked about many, many times, when you go through a recession, if you can keep
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:56.040]   your job and keep your income flowing into your house, your experience of that recession
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.480]   will not be severe.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.280]   It'll be kind of a, it won't be a big deal in your life.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:06.040]   It'll just be a relatively minor thing that you remember.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.640]   Okay, there was a recession of 2020.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:15.360]   But if you lose your job, then it will be a deeply emotional thing in your life, a deeply
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:20.920]   difficult scarring thing in your life.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.320]   You know, you get kicked out of your house, you get foreclosed on, those now, you get
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.760]   your car repossessed, now those things become deeper and heavier and much more difficult.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:34.360]   So work, work, work to keep your job, to avoid the layoffs, to work really hard.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.840]   And if you do get laid off, work hard to get another source of income as quickly as you
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.840]   can.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:45.520]   Just be, do everything you can to keep the income coming into your household.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.040]   Look for opportunities to grow on it.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.600]   I've got a couple of consulting clients that are starting to have some opportunities, some
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.040]   investment opportunities.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.040]   You know, competitors are starting to go bankrupt, they're starting to get in difficult times,
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.720]   mismanagement is showing up, and there's opportunities to expand their operations.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:07.360]   And so in your business, look around and see, keep your feelers out there.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.160]   One of the most useful and impactful things that you can be doing at all times is cultivating
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:19.720]   deals, cultivating deal flows, what I call it, but just building deal flow.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.080]   And every business is different in terms of thinking about how you're going to build deal
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.940]   flow, but you've got to think to yourself, where are my investment opportunities going
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.120]   to come from?
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.960]   And then how can I cultivate them by cultivating the relationships that would lead to them?
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.300]   Sometimes it's cultivating a relationship with a center of influence.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.200]   That center of influence might be a broker, it could be a financial professional, it could
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:45.040]   be a bankruptcy attorney, it could be an accountant, it could be somebody who's just connected,
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.840]   you know, the person who leads the local business networking group or something like that.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.480]   But sometimes it's cultivating a center of influence.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:57.200]   Sometimes it's building friendly relationships with your collaborators or your competitors
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.520]   or joining and finding out.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.400]   But you've got to sit down and analyze your business and say, where's the deal flow going
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.400]   to come from?
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.340]   How are you going to be aware of the investment opportunities?
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:12.180]   That's how I talk about it in terms of businesses, if you're going to invest into an actively
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.420]   managed business.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.260]   But it's no different in any other kind of investment.
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.680]   If you're looking at real estate, you've got to start to cultivate that real estate deal
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.680]   flow.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.680]   Where are you going to find the properties?
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.600]   Are they going to show up on a listing website?
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.020]   Is it going to come from finding out from a family member?
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.440]   How are you going to cultivate that?
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:35.060]   If you're investing into paper assets, stocks, you've got to ask yourself, where are my areas?
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.060]   What am I watching?
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.640]   How am I going to judge these things?
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:43.000]   So be working on your deal flow because there may have already been deals.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.420]   There may be more deals coming.
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:51.000]   So if your investment strategy involves anything other than dollar cost averaging into a mutual
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.680]   fund, be thinking carefully about your deal flow.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.280]   If you're dollar cost averaging into a mutual fund, good for you.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.800]   I think it's pretty remarkable to see the changes in the stock market over the past
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.360]   months and to see where we are.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:13.560]   It's certainly head scratching, I think, for most of us.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:19.480]   It's head scratching, but you can see it there, see the difficulty of predicting market momentum,
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.200]   broadly speaking.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.400]   So it's an interesting time to be an investor.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.440]   What else?
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:33.400]   I think that you see now more than ever the importance of physical preparedness.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:40.360]   I expected the risk of violence to increase over the course of a pandemic.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:46.760]   Usually when you have economic unrest and economic difficulties, you usually will have
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:51.240]   increased risks of violence, increasing crime rates, et cetera.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:55.480]   I didn't expect that the cause of those things.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:01.240]   I didn't anticipate that the cause would be a police killing or a couple of killings,
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:06.520]   I guess, but certainly that's as reasonable as anything else in terms of a cause.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.920]   And so good preparation still comes into play.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.400]   I think one of the most important things to learn from the current emergencies and the
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:22.160]   current disasters is simply how disasters can build one on top of another.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.480]   And this is, I think, common example.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.160]   Hurricanes.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:34.120]   Hurricane comes through town, blows some trees down.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:42.320]   It's bad, but it's not terrible.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.080]   What makes the hurricane terrible is when you're out cutting trees down after the hurricane
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:51.200]   and trying to clean up your yard and you saw your leg off with a chainsaw and now you can't
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.880]   go to work the next day.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.320]   That's what makes the hurricane really, really terrible.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.520]   It's the combination.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.200]   And usually that's only the case for a small number of people.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.480]   But what you see right now, if you study the current disasters, you see that happening.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:11.880]   So you see coronavirus, disaster for some people who are dying, six figures in the United
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.240]   States, hundreds of thousands of people globally.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.780]   It's a disaster for them, disaster for their families.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:26.800]   Coronavirus is having a heavy impact on many businesses, certain types of businesses.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:32.080]   And then all of a sudden, you're one of those people who is in a business that's in an area
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.080]   that's affected by rioting and looting.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.560]   And now it's just triple whammy.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:43.120]   There are people out there right now who have lost a loved one due to coronavirus, who have
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:52.840]   lost huge amounts of business due to the lockdowns and the restrictions.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:27:00.760]   And then their front windows have been stoved in by a looter and now they're done.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.640]   And so you see how these things add on top of each other.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:10.160]   And it's just a sobering reminder, very, very sobering reminder as to how things can go
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.600]   from bad to worse quicker than you imagine.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:19.440]   And even where we are, an honest accounting, there are a number of ways that things could
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.080]   get much, much worse very quickly.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:27.280]   I don't even like to talk about it, I don't like to think about it, but it's worth thinking
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.300]   about and talking about, and you got to be prepared.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:35.000]   So stay focused on your basic preparations.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.340]   Have physical security in place.
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.100]   If you're not living in a safe place, get out.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:45.340]   You can see right now how many disasters can be affected differently by being in a safe
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:50.300]   place versus not being in a safe place.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:57.640]   Whether that's simply living in a downtown city, which is prone to social unrest versus
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.300]   living out in the country, even just the experience of a lockdown.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:05.460]   I've reflected many times over the past months of how dramatically different the experience
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:11.500]   of somebody living in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, or downtown Atlanta, or downtown
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:17.980]   New York City is versus somebody living in a rural area of Tennessee, or a rural area
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.300]   of Nebraska, or et cetera.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.580]   It's just night and day in terms of the actual experience of something like that.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:28.980]   I'm so grateful having children not to live in a little tiny apartment.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:34.460]   And it's such a brutal situation for the millions of families around the world who have a little
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.500]   apartment that they live in and they've got children and everyone's locked down.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.980]   It's really, really tough.
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:45.660]   So be considerate and thoughtful of your physical safety.
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.500]   If you live in a place and you're concerned about your physical safety, I'd encourage
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.580]   you to go.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:56.260]   This comes into play even on a broader state level and national level.
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.620]   It would seem to me that with the current social unrest in the United States, it would
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:07.740]   seem to me that most of the physical safety concerns could be handled by simply staying
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:08.740]   home.
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:14.700]   There would be only a few places, I guess, where there would be that much of a risk of
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:21.340]   physical safety, of loss of life, unless you're out and about and involved in a violent incident.
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.820]   But if you simply stay home, the physical safety is pretty low.
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:29.020]   But that could change very quickly.
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:34.620]   The current tensions, political and racial tensions in the United States, certainly very
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.980]   bad, very, very bad right now, but they could get far worse.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:44.420]   And there are a couple of things that could happen that could just simply set things off.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:50.540]   So far, I've been generally appreciative of the amount of restraint and the number of
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:57.540]   peaceful people as compared to the small number of people using the opportunity to be violent
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:03.060]   and engage in violence and theft and killing.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.300]   But that could change.
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:09.540]   A significant – a small but significant percentage of society is made up of people
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:15.500]   who just don't care and people who are fundamentally evil and who will use any situation that they
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:20.820]   can to do things that they just feel they can get away with.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:30.980]   And so thus far, things have been on the whole about as much as you can expect.
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.500]   But it could get a lot worse.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:41.260]   All you need is for – I mean, if the police violence has been bad so far, there have been
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:46.220]   a couple of police officers killed, but all you need is a handful of people to go out
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.620]   and – like happened in Dallas a number of years ago.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:53.660]   It was at 2017, I think, when the guy went out in Dallas and just started killing and
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.420]   shooting police officers.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.500]   I mean, think things are bad now?
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:04.380]   It would be far worse if some guy goes out and just starts killing people randomly.
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:13.740]   The police arrested today some of the far right violent elements, and all you need is
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.260]   for a few of those guys to slip through and all of a sudden things could be much, much
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.260]   worse.
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.900]   So if you're living in one of those places, if you're living in a big city, have a plan
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.700]   to get out and have a place to go.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.740]   You'll have to judge the risks locally.
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.740]   It would be foolish for me to say, "Get out," right?
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:31.140]   There's no need for that at this point in time.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.780]   But you better have a plan to get out.
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.980]   I think it's remarkable to watch.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:39.500]   One of the things I didn't expect is that – I didn't expect the United States of
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:44.460]   America to start to get behind on things like passports.
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:49.020]   Right now if you want a new passport, the United States of America, unless you can prove
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.460]   to them that it's an emergency, basically you can't get one.
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.460]   You can't get one.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:57.620]   I've been preaching at you for years, feeling like a broken record.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:58.620]   Get your passports.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.860]   Get your passports.
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.060]   Make sure that you and everyone in your family has passports so you can get out.
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.920]   That one little document, that one little piece of paper, or little booklet I guess
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:11.740]   I should say, is the thing that opens up the ticket for you to get from one place to another.
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:17.460]   You can completely change your circumstances if you go from one place to another with that
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.780]   little passport.
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:22.560]   But if you can't get that thing, you're sunk.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.780]   There are so many people around the world.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:29.260]   My travels, I ran into Venezuelans and so many Venezuelans and they're always – they're
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.500]   like, "Yeah, I'm Venezuelan but I'm also Spanish.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.500]   Here's my Spanish passport.
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.300]   This one is I got because my Venezuelan one, I can't get a new one made."
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.660]   Well, to see that in the United States right now, you can still get one but you have to
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.460]   prove that it's an emergency.
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.660]   So don't wait around.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:49.340]   Get that stuff going because countries can close their borders and if you got to get
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.900]   out, you got to get out.
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.360]   So you need to have that stuff now.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:57.700]   So I would have some bags packed and have a few different places ready to go and just
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:02.300]   be watching because things could get worse.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.740]   I hope they don't.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.660]   So far, some of the worst case fears have not come to pass.
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:11.620]   Thankfully, for example, there's not been any evidence of bank instability in the United
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:12.620]   States.
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:13.620]   I'm grateful for that.
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.780]   There's been no runs on the banks in the United States, modest runs on the banks in
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:17.780]   other places.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.660]   There's hyperinflation in Lebanon right now.
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:31.140]   Some modest bank runs in Argentina, bank runs in Brazil but very, very modest.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:40.260]   And so thankfully, my fears about bank runs have not happened.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:45.260]   And again, thankfully, no major concerns yet about inflation but you need to be prepared.
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.320]   The time to be prepared is far before you ever need it.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.320]   What else can you do?
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:54.820]   I think one of the things that you see right now is the power of community and community
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:58.660]   is at the core of how you get through something.
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:03.180]   And so whatever community means to you, invest into your local community.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.400]   Get together with your neighbors.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.220]   Make sure you get together with your neighbors.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:10.780]   If there are various groups that you're involved in, it can be political groups, political
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:16.300]   action groups, whatever it is, be ready.
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:21.940]   But be involved in your community, your local church, your town, etc.
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:25.180]   It's crucial and there are a lot of people right now who are hurting.
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.580]   There are a lot of people who don't have food.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.380]   There are a lot of people who are hurting.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.940]   And so find out about who those people are.
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:36.980]   If you really want to gain political influence in your community, meet the needs of the people
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:37.980]   in that community.
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:45.180]   When a government stops meeting the needs of its people, the authority of that government
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:49.100]   quickly disappears where people just aren't willing to pay attention.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.740]   And so what do you do?
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.160]   You step in and you meet the needs of that community.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:35:01.420]   So get involved in your local community and seek to build and to cultivate community,
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.020]   whatever that means in your local context.
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.380]   Beyond that, there's not a lot that you can do.
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.820]   There's not a lot that you can do.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.140]   You can do things.
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:17.020]   You can be an activist, write on social media, write articles.
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:21.860]   There's of course a place for that and that may have some effect.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.700]   I'm skeptical of the effect.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:29.740]   I don't see a lot of people that are able to effectively persuade other people to their
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.740]   position.
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:38.780]   But if you've got a tool of persuasion to bring people over, then exercise that.
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:43.220]   I think you see right now, I'll stop there.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:48.020]   I don't know a lot else that you can do except to those things.
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:52.260]   Work to care for your family, care for your community, work to shore up your personal
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:58.420]   finances, work to keep your income coming in, and then look for opportunity.
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.860]   Look for opportunity in the midst of crisis.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:13.380]   I know that my tone is not as boisterous as it usually is.
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.380]   Got to be honest.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.380]   I'm trying to be honest.
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:19.540]   I always try to tell you where I've been wrong, where I think I'm right.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.540]   But I can't.
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:26.300]   It's hard to put on a happy tone and kind of be Mr. Optimistic sometimes, as you well
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.780]   know.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.980]   So that's where I think we are.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.260]   But I hope you're doing well.
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:37.060]   I hope that you're prepared for this current event and I hope that things will go through
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.060]   there.
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:44.380]   I'm going to go ahead and re-put into, in the light of the current police tension, I'm
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.900]   going to go ahead and put again into the podcast feed a replay of the show I did a number of
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:54.260]   years ago on how to arrest proof yourself, how to arrest proof yourself and your children
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.380]   so that you don't get arrested.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:03.660]   If you are in the process of going out and getting arrested, I certainly understand.
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:09.580]   It certainly seems that there are times that it's worth it to take a stand for what you
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.900]   believe in and to get yourself arrested.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.340]   I would beg of you though, count the cost.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.380]   Make sure you're ready to pay the cost.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:25.620]   Just the simple act of getting arrested, if you're engaging in civil disobedience or protesting
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.540]   or some other form of demonstration.
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:34.780]   I respect you and my hat's off to you for sticking to your convictions and advocating
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.500]   for the things that you believe.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.380]   But I would beg you to count the cost.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:43.420]   And I would encourage you, one of the things that is such a concern is that one of the
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.780]   practical things, I try to find the solutions that work.
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.220]   I try to find the things that are likely to be effective.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.140]   And if I can find those things, I like to share them.
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:58.380]   And it's deeply frustrating to me when I can't find the common threads that will work.
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:02.780]   But one of the things that does still work in the United States for those who are concerned
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:07.620]   about tensions with the police, what does work are the things that I talked about in
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.900]   that show on arrest proofing yourself and your children.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:11.900]   It does still work.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:16.220]   The rule of law is thankfully still in force.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.540]   You still have a number of rights that you can exercise and that you should exercise,
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.140]   you must exercise.
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:26.340]   And there are a lot of things that you can do to protect yourself.
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:32.020]   And so whether it's teaching your neighbors about how to conduct themselves during a traffic
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:39.260]   stop, teaching your neighbors how to conduct themselves during encounters with the police.
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.980]   I teach a little classes on it.
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:45.740]   Anytime I can, I try to take someone and say, "Listen, let's drill you on what you do when
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:51.500]   you get pulled over, what you don't do, what you do if when you're speaking to the police,
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:52.500]   what you don't do."
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:57.940]   And I feel like that's a really practical area of advocacy that can really help.
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:01.700]   So if you listen to that show, recorded a number of years ago, but if you listen to
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:05.440]   that show, I hope it'll help you to take some of the ideas and techniques and teach them
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.440]   to someone else.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:13.180]   Thank you for listening.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.680]   (dog barking)
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:24.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
