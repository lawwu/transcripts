[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   Caleb from Fremont, California writes in to ask, "Pastor John, in a previous
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.360]   episode you answered the question, 'How do you process public tragedy?'" That was
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.600]   episode 85. "To which your response was very to the point. God ordains these
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.440]   things to glorify himself through people being outraged at sin and responding to
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.200]   victims with compassion. A follow-up question that I'm now wrestling with is
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.240]   this, 'How does God ordain evil acts without himself becoming evil?'" We need a
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:40.440]   category in our minds that goes something like this, "God can will that
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:51.680]   sin be without sinning." It's not a sin for God to choose that sin should be,
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:03.360]   should exist. And I say that because the Bible pictures God giving us grace in
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:12.360]   Christ Jesus before the ages began, which means that he was planning for the fall
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.720]   which would then need to be redeemed by the crucified Christ through grace. And
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.440]   that was all being planned before anything had happened. So he's planning
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.520]   for the the downfall of man. Same thing in Revelations 13, 8 where there's this
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.480]   book that God's writing before the foundation of the world and the name of
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.840]   the book is the book of the life of the Lamb who was slain. So you have Jesus in
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.680]   the mind of God slain for sinners before there is even a world, which means that
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.520]   we need a category that God is planning that sin be without himself being a
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.680]   sinner. And we know from other passages that's in fact what God does. Genesis 50
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.240]   verse 20, "As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it," that is he
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.520]   meant the evil, "for good." So God can oversee and ordain and plan that evil
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.360]   happen without himself committing evil or loving evil or doing evil himself. So
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.400]   the question as I understand it is, can we know anything about how God does that?
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.120]   And here's—this is really tough, Tony—and here's just my best shot. I thought of
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:41.440]   three things. One, God has infinite wisdom and we don't have that, and so God is in a
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.440]   position to see how evil events can be woven together to bring about a greater
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.160]   good, and we dare not follow him in this and try to do evil that good may come.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.840]   But God is infinitely wise and can see how it all fits together. A second thing
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:08.120]   is to say that when we sin, we sin sinfully. That is, we love sin. We do sin
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.320]   because it pleases us. When God ordains that sin be, he doesn't do it
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.760]   because he loves sin, he hates sin. We love what we're doing. We wouldn't do it.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.160]   Nobody gets up in the morning and says, "I got to sin some today out of duty. I
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.960]   don't feel like sinning, but I really should sin some today." We don't ever do
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:35.280]   that. We embrace sin because it pleases us. God never, never ordains that sin
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.680]   happen because it pleases him. He is managing something to a much higher end,
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.520]   so his motives and his heart are pure through and through. And the last thing
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.400]   comes from James 1 where it says, "Let no one say when he's tempted, 'I am being
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.200]   tempted by God,' for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.920]   no one. But each person is tempted when he's lured and enticed by his own desire."
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.600]   And a lot of people quote that and say, "God tempts no one with evil, so he can't
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:20.400]   be ordaining that someone sin." But that's not quite what it says. It says that
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.000]   temptation is being lured and enticed by his own desire. God cannot experience
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.240]   that. He's never lured and enticed towards evil by his own desire, and
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.280]   therefore he doesn't do that to people, which means he does not commend sin to
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.480]   people, he does not approve sin in people, and he does not directly awaken sin in
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.640]   anybody. He hasn't directly awakened those lurings and those yearnings
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:59.560]   toward sin. However, he knows as God all the circumstances that a corrupt heart
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.160]   will respond to that way. He knows exactly how Satan functions and what
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.440]   Satan does in response to those kinds of things, and he may ordain that those
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.240]   circumstances and that Satan be in such a position that a corrupt heart will
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:26.160]   respond that way. And so I think those three things at least distinguish God
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.320]   from us, and I should say one other thing about the comfort that God's
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:39.400]   sovereignty is to us. A lot of people stumble over the sovereignty of God in
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.640]   the control that he has ultimately over all things, including our lives, but
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.320]   according to Paul there's a huge assurance in that as well, because he
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:00.920]   says, "God does not let us be tempted beyond what we are able, but with the
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:07.280]   temptation makes a way of escape that we may be able to endure it," which means
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.720]   that his sovereignty over what he allows into our lives is perfectly calculated
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.000]   so that none of his children is ever brought to destruction through
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.040]   temptation. Thank you, Pastor John, and for more on this topic, see Pastor John's
