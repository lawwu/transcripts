[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   It's when your enemy puts you on death ground,
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.200]   which means they're going to kill you.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.800]   And therefore, you have no choice but to fight.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.760]   Because if you don't fight, you're dead.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.800]   And even if you fight, your odds are poor.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.240]   But at least that's the only way you're going to get out.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.440]   The Ukrainians initially welcomed the Germans.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.920]   Why?
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.320]   Because Stalin and friends had imposed the terrible famine
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.560]   of the early 1930s on them.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.200]   And they couldn't imagine that anything
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.000]   would be worse than that until they
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.760]   met Nazis, who then had them dig their own mass graves.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.640]   And if you do this to people, you
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.040]   will conjure a formidable enemy.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.440]   So that's what happened to Russia.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.760]   You can see it happening to Ukraine now before your eyes.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.680]   Go back before the invasion of Crimea in 2014.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.000]   You've got Ukraine, which has a very corrupt government.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.840]   And people were at sixes and sevens
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.120]   about whether they want to do Ukrainian things
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.920]   or Russian things.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.880]   OK.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.360]   Fast forward to now, where you have Russians blowing away
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.880]   the people who were most loyal to them
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.200]   in the eastern part of the country who didn't leave.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.800]   Their apartment buildings are being leveled by Russians.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.280]   And our irony is Putin's forging Ukrainian national identity.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.240]   And wars often do this.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.800]   In the United States, we start out with our 13 colonies.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.800]   And they're all very different after the Revolutionary War.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.440]   That starts forging a national identity.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.200]   And by the time you get to the end of the Civil War, where
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.760]   you have Northern armies, at least those people
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.800]   have been all over the country, they
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.240]   of a real sense of nation by the end of that one.
