[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.520]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.240]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.900]   My guest today is Dr. Jordan Peterson.
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.080]   Dr. Jordan Peterson is a psychologist, an author,
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.800]   and one of the most influential
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.080]   public intellectuals of our time.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.560]   Today, we discuss the human animal,
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.000]   what it means to be a human being
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.100]   at the level of psychology, at the level of neuroscience,
[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.320]   and indeed, at the level of expression
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.900]   of different personality types within us.
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.720]   Most of us don't think about having different personalities.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.060]   However, as we discuss today,
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.660]   due to the activity of specific brain circuitries,
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.280]   including the hypothalamus,
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.600]   the prefrontal cortex, and others,
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.680]   we each and all can adopt different states of mind
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.080]   that powerfully influence our emotions,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.920]   our thoughts, and our actions.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.240]   And in so doing, we are different people
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.200]   depending on those states of mind.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.440]   Today's discussion is both an intellectual one
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.840]   and a practical one.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.060]   You will learn where and how to place your thoughts.
[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.520]   You will learn the relationship
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.600]   between the call to adventure and responsibility.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.480]   And as Dr. Peterson emphasizes in his new book,
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.360]   "We Who Wrestle With God,"
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.460]   he emphasizes the use of story,
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.360]   in this case, biblical stories,
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.880]   to understand oneself and to best guide one's actions
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.660]   towards the most positive and generative outcomes.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.540]   We discuss the self, romantic relationships and commitments,
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.400]   the family, community, and culture.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.120]   We also discuss the media, politics, cancel culture,
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.360]   things like social media and pornography,
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.680]   shifting masculine and feminine roles,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.880]   and the innate human drive to create action at a distance,
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.840]   both in space and in time.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.080]   Today's discussion is both intellectual and practical.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.320]   Dr. Peterson emphasizes how to use different sources
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.320]   of story, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.600]   to understand and best guide one's decision-making process.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.220]   Indeed, he discusses the tight relationship
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.600]   between the call to adventure and responsibility
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.760]   as a trustable framework for moving forward in life
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.360]   towards one's best possible outcomes.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.840]   And I'm certain that by the end of today's discussion,
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.680]   you will be thinking about your own neural circuits,
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.320]   that is the connections in your brain
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.240]   that drive emotions, thoughts, and behavior,
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.440]   as well as your psychology, your different states of mind,
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.680]   and you're going to have a number of different tools
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.840]   and frameworks with which to apply all that knowledge
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.040]   toward the best possible outcomes.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.920]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.240]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.040]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.200]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.120]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.200]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.660]   to the general public.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.760]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.720]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.760]   Our first sponsor is David.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.440]   David makes a protein bar unlike any other.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.240]   It has 28 grams of protein,
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.000]   only 150 calories, and zero grams of sugar.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   That's right, 28 grams of protein,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.860]   and 75% of its calories come from protein.
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.960]   These bars from David also taste amazing.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.240]   My favorite flavor is chocolate chip cookie dough,
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.720]   but then again, I also like the chocolate fudge-flavored one,
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.200]   and I also like the cake-flavored one.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.040]   Basically, I like all the flavors.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.560]   They're incredibly delicious.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.560]   For me personally, I strive to eat mostly whole foods.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.420]   However, when I'm in a rush, or I'm away from home,
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.440]   or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.640]   I often find that I'm looking
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.800]   for a high-quality protein source.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.200]   With David, I'm able to get 28 grams of protein
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.880]   with the calories of a snack,
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.940]   which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.360]   of one gram of protein per pound of body weight each day,
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.680]   and it allows me to do that
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.680]   without taking in excess calories.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.960]   I typically eat a David bar in the early afternoon
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.400]   or even mid-afternoon if I want to bridge that gap
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.960]   between lunch and dinner.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.240]   I like that it's a little bit sweet,
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.740]   so it tastes like a tasty snack,
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.680]   but it's also given me that 28 grams
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.080]   of very high-quality protein with just 150 calories.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.480]   If you would like to try David,
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.800]   you can go to davidprotein.com/huberman.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.920]   Again, the link is davidprotein.com/huberman.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.000]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.680]   Levels is a program that lets you see
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.240]   how different foods affect your health
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.680]   by giving you real-time feedback on your diet
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.760]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.060]   One of the most important factors
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.040]   in both your short and long-term health
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.420]   is your body's ability to manage blood glucose
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.440]   or blood sugar.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.640]   To maintain energy and focus throughout the day,
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.300]   you want to keep your blood glucose steady
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.560]   without big spikes or crashes.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.900]   I first started using Levels about three years ago
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.440]   as a way to understand how different foods
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.360]   impacted my blood glucose levels,
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.980]   and it's proven incredibly informative
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.840]   for determining my food choices,
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.440]   when I eat specific foods,
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.440]   and how I time eating relative to things like my workouts,
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.600]   both weight training and cardiovascular training,
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.720]   things like running,
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.260]   and when to eat before I go to sleep
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.920]   to allow for the most stable blood sugar
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.020]   throughout the night.
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.900]   Indeed, using Levels has helped shape my entire schedule.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.000]   So if you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.800]   and trying a CGM yourself,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.040]   you can go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.160]   Levels has just launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.420]   and has even better tracking than before.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.740]   Right now, they're also offering
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.040]   an additional two free months of membership.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.400]   Again, that's levels.link, spelled L-I-N-K/huberman,
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.320]   to try the new sensor and two free months of membership.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.460]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Jordan Peterson.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.940]   Dr. Jordan Peterson, welcome.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.180]   - Thank you, sir.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.680]   - Delighted to have you here,
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.740]   and want to talk about elements within your new book,
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.860]   also some elements within your previous books,
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.440]   and within that mind of yours generally.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.780]   As a framework for that,
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.220]   I'm wondering if you would tolerate or permit
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.220]   a little bit of a discussion about brain and psychology,
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.260]   just kind of lay the groundwork for where we might prod
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.100]   some of the themes that you bring up related to the book.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.340]   So I view the brain as, obviously,
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.920]   a bunch of cells and parts, et cetera,
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.940]   but I distill it down to some sort of basic features.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.780]   First of all, we have an autonomic physiology,
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.020]   I think we'd both agree on that,
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.700]   that regulates our sleepiness and wakefulness,
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.780]   our breathing, our heart rate,
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.460]   stuff that runs in the background.
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.740]   And then we have a lot of circuitry devoted to
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.220]   what I would call impulses,
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.200]   things that we desire we want to move toward,
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.720]   appetitive behaviors,
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   and we also have some impulses to avoid things
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.520]   that are putrid, painful, et cetera.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.000]   That's all in there like it is in other angles.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.740]   - We should talk about the idea of impulse
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.800]   in relationship to that characterization.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.700]   - Okay.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.780]   - 'Cause there's an important point to be made on the,
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.560]   you pay a price for characterizing that as impulse,
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.440]   and I'd like to explore that with you 'cause it's crucial.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.700]   - Great, we'll circle back to impulse, I'd like to do that.
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.580]   And then we have a lot of circuitry,
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.980]   people will hear about it as executive function,
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.460]   prefrontal circuitry, which does many things,
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.460]   but I like to think of as a circuit that can say,
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.060]   and here I'm borrowing from a previous guest
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.020]   who's a neurosurgeon,
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.820]   it can say, shh, or exert what's called top-down suppression
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.900]   on these, what I'm calling impulses.
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.740]   It can-
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.100]   - We should talk about that too,
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.060]   the suppression idea and the inhibition idea in general.
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.900]   - Great.
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.820]   - Because there's, I think there's a parallel problem there
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.340]   to the notion of impulse that's very much worth delving into.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.300]   - Great. - Yeah.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.260]   - So circuitry that's devoted to our ability
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.040]   to self-inhibit the desire to reach for something
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.880]   or to avoid something.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.220]   We can push ourselves into things
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.140]   that would otherwise be aversive,
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.980]   we can avoid doing things that would otherwise drive us
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.260]   to quote unquote, just do it anyway.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.080]   And then we have what I think of as our default settings,
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.840]   kind of how we're operating in the world
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.140]   with respect to food, other people, ourselves, our thoughts,
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.560]   if we don't intervene with ourselves.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.760]   And these default settings are of course established
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.880]   by both nature, a genetic program that wires up circuitry,
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.840]   but also nurture because of the immense neuroplasticity
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.480]   that occurs in the first 25 years plus of life,
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.600]   but especially those first years of life.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.680]   And then of course we have neuroplasticity,
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.820]   this incredible gift that humans have more of
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.560]   than any other species as far as we know,
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.200]   which is we can decide to make changes.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.800]   Now, the reason I lay out this framework
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.260]   as opposed to starting with a question
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.860]   is because there are so many amazing questions
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.500]   that you ask in this book, we who wrestle with God,
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.860]   I've been trying to wrap our arms and minds
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.320]   around this huge set of questions.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.180]   And it occurred to me to just step back from all of that
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:40.080]   and ask, is part of the reason that we have a concept of God
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.840]   that there are multiple religions,
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.000]   is that the consequence of some humans at some point
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.760]   realizing, or perhaps God himself realizing,
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.920]   that what we are equipped with as humans,
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.320]   which we just described, is insufficient to allow us
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.200]   to evolve as a species and be the best version of ourselves.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.660]   I think this for me really is like the central question
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.760]   of at least my life, which is, to what extent do I need
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.520]   to intervene with my default settings, rewire them,
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.280]   engage that prefrontal cortex and push down
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.400]   on some appetitive or aversive behaviors?
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.840]   And to what extent can we do that?
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.780]   Maybe- - And to what end?
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:23.620]   - And to what end?
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.740]   And maybe we need a rule book.
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.180]   You know, I am starting to believe,
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.980]   and I'm now 49 years old, that we need a rule book,
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.540]   that the neural circuitry that's encased within our skulls
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.100]   is not sufficient to allow us to navigate through life
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.220]   to our best outcome.
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.140]   - We kind of know that we need a rule book,
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.300]   even you admitted that in some ways implicitly
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.500]   when you discussed the fact that we have
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.100]   a 25-year socialization window.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.880]   And what that means is that we have to interact
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.180]   with other people and our traditions
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.380]   in order to set us right.
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.220]   And that's so complex it takes 25 years.
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.980]   And so we're learning something from that.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.060]   And that's indication that our, let's say,
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.460]   default biological settings are insufficient
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.220]   to guide us into the future, right?
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.100]   And so then the question is, well, what is it
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.200]   that you're learning as a consequence
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.340]   of that socialization process?
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.580]   And you can think about it, and people have thought about it
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.760]   as a series of complex inhibitions
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.120]   of lower order motivational states, impulses.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.920]   But I'm not very happy with the inhibition model
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.040]   because inhibition is unsophisticated socialization.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.560]   Integration is sophisticated socialization.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.960]   So here's a way of, I really learned this, I think,
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.400]   from contrasting Freud with Piaget.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.040]   'Cause Freud's model, superego,
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.640]   is really an inhibition model.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.840]   And Freud was a neurologist.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.180]   Piaget's model was very different.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.680]   He thought of the properly socialized person
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.220]   as someone who had integrated their lower order,
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.060]   we'll call them impulses for now,
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.900]   into a sustainable voluntary structure
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.980]   that regulated them and gave them all their proper place.
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.540]   That's very different than an inhibitory model.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.740]   So for example, I'll give you an example from my own life.
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.740]   My son was quite a willful young child when he was two.
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.000]   - I'm wondering where he got it from.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.400]   - Yeah, well, fair enough.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.200]   And my father was a formidable character.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   And so my son liked to do what he liked to do.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.600]   And it took him quite a bit of tussling with him
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.000]   to help him, I wouldn't say inhibit that,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.760]   or regulate it, to integrate it.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.360]   And one of the consequences of that
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.680]   was he became a very good athlete.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.080]   And so why is that relevant?
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.360]   Well, because it wasn't like he stopped being assertive
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.660]   or even aggressive.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.880]   It's that he learned how to put that aggression
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.200]   in its proper place in relationship
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.600]   to a goal that was much more sophisticated
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.880]   than merely getting his own way moment to moment.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.480]   Okay, so integration's a better,
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.400]   like a very sophisticated athlete,
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.800]   a team athlete in particular, isn't not aggressive.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.120]   And they're not inhibiting their aggression
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.160]   on the playing field.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.520]   They may now and then when they're provoked, let's say,
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.280]   but all things considered,
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.520]   what they've done is subordinate their aggression
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.080]   to a higher order goal
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.320]   that enables them to be more successful,
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.880]   but also to be successful
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.760]   in a maximally social and sustainable way.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.480]   And Piaget's point, and he's absolutely right about this,
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.440]   is that that's much better conceptualized as integration.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.940]   And then with regard to impulse,
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.600]   'cause I said I would return to that,
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.560]   I spent a lot of time walking
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.720]   through the behavioral literature, right?
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.320]   And a lot of that was derived from animal experiments
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.480]   and it was predicated on the idea
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.880]   that if you could explain something
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.000]   on the basis of a deterministic reflex, you should.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.160]   And there's something to be said for that hypothesis.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.320]   Don't make your theory any more complex
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.160]   than it needs to be.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.840]   How far can you get with a theory of chained reflexes,
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.960]   a deterministic theory?
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.760]   The behavior's gone a long way.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.280]   They couldn't get to the highest strata of human endeavor
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.760]   with a chained reflex theory,
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.540]   but there was a lot of things they did that were very good.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.780]   But one of the things they made a big mistake about
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.440]   was to conceptualize motivational states,
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.320]   let's say, as impulses or drives.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.920]   That's not sufficient because it fails to take into account
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.560]   the effect of those states on perception.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.680]   So it's much better to think of a motivated state.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.960]   This is what helped me integrate behavioral theory
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.720]   with psychoanalytic theory,
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.720]   especially the psychoanalytic theory of religious endeavor.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.980]   It's much better to think of those lower-order
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.500]   motivational states as personalities.
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.560]   They're sub-personalities.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.620]   They have their perceptions.
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.700]   They have their objects of perception.
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.000]   They have their cognitive rationalizations.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.380]   You certainly see that in addiction, let's say.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.020]   They have their emotions.
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:04.220]   Like, they are small personalities, unidimensional,
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.440]   very narrow-minded personalities.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.380]   But they're personalities, they're not impulses.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.260]   - So are they personalities within our,
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.920]   what most people would think of as our larger personality?
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.680]   I mean, what I'm hearing is that,
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.300]   let's say somebody's an addict.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.020]   - It depends on how integrated you are
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.300]   because you could be nothing but a succession
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.620]   of dominion of sub-personalities.
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.460]   That's what a two-year-old is, right?
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:31.100]   And so you have to build an integrating personality
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.100]   on top of those sub-personalities,
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.740]   but not in a manner that inhibits them.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:39.460]   That means your socialization is unsophisticated.
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.500]   Even Freud knew this because,
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.960]   even though he had basically an inhibitory model
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.960]   of, say, superego regulation,
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.400]   he believed that a healthy personality
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.020]   would have the impulse of aggression
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:56.160]   and the impulse of sexuality to take two major,
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.240]   lower-order motivational states into account,
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.180]   would have them integrated into the functioning ego.
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.060]   The issue is integration.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.740]   And so what you're doing when you're social,
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.400]   like, okay, when my son, for example,
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.140]   would become willful in a manner
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.900]   that I regarded as counterproductive
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.980]   for him and the household,
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.500]   and the rule would be you can't act that way
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.040]   because if you act that way,
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.100]   people aren't going to approve of you,
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.100]   and that's a bad plan.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.380]   So you have to control that
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.900]   because it's not gonna work out well for you if you don't.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.380]   Okay, so I use time-out.
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.140]   Now, time-out is an effective disciplinary strategy
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.140]   for social creatures because we don't like isolation.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.980]   And so time-out basically takes a child,
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.700]   puts the child in isolation.
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.820]   That produces a pain-like response
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.180]   because social isolation produces pain.
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.860]   - It's pure inhibition, right?
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.340]   - Well, that's the question.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.260]   You see, that's the question.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.860]   He had to inhibit his immediate desire,
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.340]   say, to run around because he was gonna sit on the steps.
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.380]   But see, I put a rule in place there,
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:05.060]   and the rule was as soon as you get yourself under control,
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.620]   you can leave the stairs.
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.140]   Okay, so now the question is what does under control mean?
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.820]   One interpretation is inhibition.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.500]   Another interpretation is no, no.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.340]   He's developing a superordinate personality,
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.380]   probably cortically, that has enough dominion
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.740]   so that those underlying motivational states
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.140]   can now be integrated and placed properly into a hierarchy.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.180]   And when I'm insisting that he regulate his behavior
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.540]   and I allow him to move off the step
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.740]   when he is now able to be a social creature again,
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.620]   instead of falling prey to his whim,
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.380]   I'm reinforcing the cortical integration
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.940]   of those underlying motivational states.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.980]   Now, you might think the human organism
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.580]   comes into the world with a warring battleground
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.300]   of primordial motivational states.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.200]   That's a perfectly reasonable view.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.500]   We know a lot of that is mediated by the hypothalamus,
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.940]   for example, and the amygdala and these lower order,
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.300]   biologically, what, pre-programmed,
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.580]   to some degree, pre-programmed systems.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:10.380]   Now, the specific manner in which those systems
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.780]   should find their expression and the specific way
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.580]   that they're going to be hierarchically integrated
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.820]   is going to depend to a tremendous degree
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.700]   on the particulars of the society at that moment,
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.340]   which is why you need that 18-year framework
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:27.540]   to hone the manner in which those systems
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.760]   make themselves manifest.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.140]   But I think the best way to conceptualize that
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.940]   is that it's the hierarchical integration
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.420]   of the motivational states
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.460]   within an overarching superordinate personality.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.780]   And that personality is not bound to the moment.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.100]   It takes the medium and long-term into account.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.780]   And it's not self-serving, like a two-year-old would be,
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.480]   because you have to take other people into account
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.140]   if you're going to be successful.
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.740]   So, and this is where the cortex comes in,
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.620]   as far as I'm concerned, this is what it's doing.
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.900]   It's stretching the, it's integrating the lower order,
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.000]   temporally bound motivational states
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.940]   that are specifically self-serving
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.100]   to a much broader vision of the world
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.500]   that takes the future into account and other people.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.660]   And that's hard, it's very hard.
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.360]   - I love this, and I'll tell you why,
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.980]   because the way that I think of the prefrontal cortex
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.180]   is that its main job is context-dependent strategy setting.
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.140]   - Right, context-dependent. - Context-dependent.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.000]   - Right, that's a crucial issue.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.180]   - And you mentioned hypothalamus, this, you know,
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.340]   it's basically the size of, you know,
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.500]   two marbles or so sitting above the roof of our mouth,
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.740]   tiny, tiny little brain area.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.200]   It's mostly switches in there.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.060]   What do I mean by that?
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.520]   Anytime a neurosurgeon has stimulated neurons
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.020]   in a little sub-area of the hypothalamus,
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.260]   you get either rage or sexual appetite
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.620]   or mating with inanimate objects.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.740]   I mean, this was done in both non-human primates
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.420]   and in humans. - Uncontrollable thirst.
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.300]   - Uncontrollable thirst, hunger,
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.860]   total suppression of hunger.
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.620]   I mean, all the basic drives are operating
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.700]   in there like switches. - Exploration.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.800]   - And prefrontal cortex has direct access to it,
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.960]   to the hypothalamus,
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.300]   and prefrontal cortex is context-dependent learning,
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.940]   context-dependent decision-making.
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.900]   And I love that you brought in this notion
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.620]   of changing an impulse,
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.740]   in the example that you gave in your son's impulse
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.620]   to be aggressive or wild in some way
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.580]   that was inappropriate for the home environment
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.860]   at that moment.
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:31.480]   And two things that you said really resonate.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.580]   The prefrontal cortex, his prefrontal cortex had to learn
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.580]   that whatever he was feeling for himself, his own desires,
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.260]   needed to be placed in a context of other people's wishes,
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.460]   desires, and needs as well.
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.140]   So there's an-- - Even for him to thrive, right?
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.420]   - It's not merely a sacrifice of his own desire
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.500]   for the sake of others.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.420]   It's like, no, no, look, kid, if you're, we know this.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.860]   If you have the same orientation towards other people
[00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.380]   at four that you did when you were two,
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.680]   especially if you're tilted a little
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.460]   in the aggressive direction,
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.980]   you will not make friends and you will be isolated
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.640]   and alienated for the rest of your life.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.640]   So that two-year-old impulsiveness, that has its place.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.360]   Two, it starts to modify radically at three
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.220]   and it better be fixed by four.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.100]   And the reason for that is that you have to integrate
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.020]   yourself into the social world,
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.520]   which means in the case of children,
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.020]   it means you wanna have friends.
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.140]   And so the reason you're disciplining your child
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.540]   isn't to teach them that what they're doing is bad,
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.460]   you know, in that simple sense
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.780]   that you might interpret punishment.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.100]   It's like, no, you need to be more sophisticated.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.100]   Well, why?
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.160]   Well, you have to be able to take turns.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.060]   Well, why?
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.540]   Well, 'cause no one like you otherwise.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.100]   Well, what's the problem with that?
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.780]   Well, first of all, we're hyper-social.
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.980]   Like, you can punish psychopaths
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.740]   by putting them in isolation.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.700]   That's how social human beings are.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.420]   You take the most anti-social human beings there are
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.300]   and you can punish them by making them be alone.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.320]   Right, so that's how social we are.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.940]   So you wanna, you're modeling for your child
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.660]   a strategy of even satisfaction
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.740]   for his own basic drives that takes context
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.640]   in the most sophisticated possible way into account.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.340]   Right, and that is, see, as soon as you understand
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.380]   that that's the fostering of like a meta-personality
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.740]   in the child, which would really be the personality
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.180]   of that child, the integrated personality,
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.180]   you start to understand how that might be related
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.300]   to religious thinking, because religious thinking
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:43.520]   is the attempt to formulate something approximating
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.580]   an ideal personality, right?
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:50.300]   Now, that's often attributed elements of the divine,
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.340]   but there's reasons for that that we could go into.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.220]   But as soon as you know that the basic structure,
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:59.020]   even at the lower motivational level, is personality,
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.200]   well, then that changes the way you view the brain.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.200]   Look, a lot of archaic deities are motivational systems.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.380]   - Could you give me an example?
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.060]   - Well, the god of war, Mars, that's rage.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.660]   That was a god that the Vikings invoked
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.100]   before they went into battle.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.260]   They would use aminita muscaria,
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.300]   and they imitated predators from an early age.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.420]   - This is acetylcholine, by the way, folks,
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.700]   has two general receptor systems,
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.560]   the nicotinic system, which is a stimulant,
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.300]   but also relaxes you, that's why people like nicotine,
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:34.780]   and then the muscarinic system, which creates changes
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.940]   in our self-perception and perception
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.820]   of the things around us.
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.300]   It's not so much a stimulant as it's a,
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.260]   I would veer towards almost like a psychedelic,
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:50.260]   or it has an effect of making us less fearful
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.820]   and intrigued.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.460]   - It's a radically atypical psychedelic.
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.500]   - Yeah, it's hard to describe.
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.620]   - Yeah, yeah. - Hard to describe.
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:02.620]   - It's outside the LSD, psilocybin, mescaline domain.
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.340]   - So people would take this as an agent.
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.180]   - The Vikings.
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.260]   - The Vikings would take this as an agent
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.140]   before going into that. - Sure, because what they
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.900]   were trying to do is make the personality
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.820]   of rage superordinate, with no pain, right?
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.740]   And they practiced that from a very early age.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.340]   So the Vikings worked themselves up, they went berserk.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.980]   That means to wear the bear shirt, right?
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.300]   They transformed themselves, so to speak, into predators.
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.420]   - They would narrow the context within which their,
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.100]   I'm calling them impulses, but you're giving
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.260]   a more sophisticated explanation for them,
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.920]   within which their, the aggressive impulse,
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.260]   the strategically aggressive impulse could be channeled.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.780]   - Right, and give full rein, give full rein, right?
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:41.620]   They were experts at that.
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.180]   - To be able to decapitate people, eviscerate people,
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.420]   do whatever it was that they needed to do in order to win,
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.180]   and to suppress their own feelings of pain.
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.940]   - Yeah, well, then you could imagine in a way
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.460]   that what they were doing was bringing the full resources
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.460]   of the cortex to, and placing them at the service
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.420]   of the rage circuits in the hypothalamus.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.020]   Like, we have no idea what that would be like.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.320]   No, there aren't, we don't do that.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.460]   We have no idea what a human being who does that is like
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.820]   if they're expert at it.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.220]   You would give you nightmares to think about it deeply.
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.820]   - Yeah, there's an experiment, if I may,
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.160]   that might shed some light on what it would look like.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.340]   A former guest on this podcast, actually,
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.780]   David Anderson at Caltech,
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.460]   has been studying hypothalamic circuits.
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.140]   And he and his former postdoc, Dayu Lin,
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.500]   discovered a small, tiny, tiny collection of neurons
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.780]   in the ventromedial hypothalamus that, when stimulated,
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.280]   would send these animals, these mice,
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.200]   you can find videos of this online, into a rage.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.760]   Now, the interesting thing is,
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.800]   is it required the presence of another mouse.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.420]   - Right, right, right.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.920]   So it's still somewhat context-dependent.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.100]   - Somewhat context-dependent.
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.320]   If they were alone in their cage,
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.600]   they wouldn't attack themselves or the walls of the cage.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.600]   But if you put a air or water-filled glove within the cage,
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.020]   they would absolutely attack it to try and destroy it.
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.080]   Then you turn off these neurons, the mouse is calm.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.700]   We can put a link to this in the "Show Note" caption.
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:00.900]   Now, here's what's remarkable.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.840]   The ventromedial hypothalamus has these neurons
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.640]   basically interspersed with other neurons
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:10.640]   that, when stimulated, suppress rage and activate copulation.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.780]   Incredible, right?
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.240]   Within the same structure,
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.020]   you have these mutually exclusive sets
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.160]   of neurons and behaviors.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.160]   And it speaks to, I think, some of the things
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.760]   that Freud and others have talked about
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.960]   in terms of the juxtaposition of these neurons,
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.160]   but that they mutually inhibit one another,
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.340]   which lends itself to some really interesting questions
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.840]   about when aggression and sexuality
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.680]   become combined in states of pathology, okay?
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:43.680]   But in any event, so context-dependent control
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.440]   over impulses, over the hypothalamus
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.460]   seems to be the theme here.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.240]   And the other thing that you mentioned
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.900]   is the ability for your son, in this case,
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.100]   but presumably also the Vikings,
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.100]   to be able to broaden their temporal scope,
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.720]   to be able to think about the time domain differently.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.060]   This is something I'm absolutely obsessed by.
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.640]   The more we experience,
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.880]   what I brought up at the beginning
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.960]   was that we have this autonomic arousal system.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.200]   The more alert we are,
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.360]   the less we are able to take ourselves
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.200]   into notions of this too shall pass,
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.420]   the past, the present, the future.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.540]   Autonomic activation, stress, panic, fear, anger,
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.880]   tend to make us lose sight. - Shrink.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.380]   - We get blinders on,
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.160]   lose sight of the fact that there was a past,
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.520]   there's a present, and there's a future.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.480]   - Yes, well, that's because they're collapsing
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.240]   your domain of apprehension to the moment,
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.760]   so you will act.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.800]   You have to collapse to the moment to act, right?
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.880]   And so we should also point out for everyone
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.160]   that you don't want to underestimate
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.840]   the sophistication of the hypothalamus.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.520]   And this is partly why conceptualizing its various states
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.800]   as subpersonalities is so useful.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.240]   I mean, it's not unsophisticated.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.760]   You can take a female cat and take out its whole brain,
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.600]   except for the hypothalamus.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.760]   So it's like 95% of its brain is gone,
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.000]   and in a relatively controlled environment,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.560]   it's indistinguishable from a normal cat.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.320]   It can do cat things and live.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.240]   Now, and it's hyper-exploratory.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.480]   Now, that's a very strange thing,
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.160]   where it's a cat with no brain, it's hyper-exploratory.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.320]   It's not what you'd think at all,
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.720]   but it shows you how sophisticated the hypothalamus is.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.000]   It can run these programs,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.200]   but they're programs of personality
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.880]   because they have perceptions.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.600]   It can run them, and it can do that quite successfully.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   Now, all the higher-order subcortical
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.840]   and cortical systems are,
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.920]   well, I think they are, to your point,
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.840]   they're ways of expanding the apprehension
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.200]   of those fundamental motivational systems
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.920]   across broader and broader spans of time,
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.480]   incorporating more and more people,
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.640]   but also solving the problem of the conflict
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.680]   that emerges between those fundamental motivational states,
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.720]   right, it's like, well, what do you do
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.160]   when you're hungry and tired, right?
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.760]   Well, you have to mediate between the states to some degree.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.840]   What do you do if you want to solve the problem
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.840]   of being hungry and tired over a long period of time
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.600]   with other people, right?
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.720]   Well, you need more and more brain to calculate that, right?
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.040]   And so a huge part of what maturation is
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.160]   is when we think about it
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.720]   as the capacity to forego gratification.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.640]   Actually, what's happening is that as you mature,
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.740]   and your cortex comes online, let's say,
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.800]   you're able to regulate your behavior
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.240]   with more and more other things taken into account.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.360]   Right, right, and there has to be some war there,
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.440]   which is why you're wrestling with God, let's say,
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.700]   there has to be some war there,
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.800]   because it's also the case that you do have to
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.620]   satiate yourself in relationship
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.240]   to your basic biological needs, or you die.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.880]   And so there's gonna be tension,
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.300]   and that is something like the tension
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.420]   between the individual and the group, you might say.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.480]   That's how the Russoians or the Freudians
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.700]   would think about it.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.960]   So the weird thing about that is that
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:04.680]   it's not useful to identify your individuality
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.400]   with the dominion of a whim.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.000]   And that's what hedonists do,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.440]   and that's what immature people do.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.960]   They think, well, why shouldn't I get what I want?
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.460]   It's like, I see, so your claim is that the you
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.980]   that's superordinate is what you want.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.060]   That isn't, that means you're subjugated
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.220]   to these low-order personalities.
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.400]   And you might say, well, why is that wrong?
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.040]   It's like, well, you're a two-year-old.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.760]   It doesn't work.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.480]   You know, if it's all about you
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.340]   and your immediate gratification,
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.240]   well, first of all, you're rather psychopathic,
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.920]   because you could think of psychopathy
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.800]   as the extension of immaturity into adulthood.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.680]   That's a pretty good default way of conceptualizing it.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.360]   And it's like, it's an unsophisticated strategy.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.280]   - They want what they want now.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.120]   - Regardless, yeah.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.040]   - And they don't care about the we.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:55.880]   - Or the future.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.700]   - Or the future.
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.840]   - See, see, this is one of the ways
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.680]   I caught on to this relationship was,
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.720]   'cause I studied antisocial behavior for a very long time.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.200]   Psychopaths, in particular, are notorious
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.540]   for their inability to learn from experience.
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.080]   Okay, so what does that mean?
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:17.080]   It means that if they do something impulsive
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.660]   that causes them trouble in the future,
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.400]   the fact of that future trouble
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.120]   has no bearing on their continued behavior.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:29.120]   Well, what that means is that they are so non-communitarian
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:34.020]   that they're willing to even betray their own future selves.
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.560]   There's no difference between that and betraying someone else.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.160]   It's exactly the same mechanism.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.600]   - Very much a toddler, toddler.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.760]   - Well, so here's something I learned in Montreal.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.080]   I worked with a man named Richard Tremblay there,
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.720]   and Richard, I think Richard's lab
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.080]   used up 1/3 of all social science funding
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.320]   for Quebec at one time.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.120]   He was a radically successful researcher,
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.400]   and he was really interested in antisocial behavior
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.040]   and was trying to get to the roots,
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   and one of the conclusions that our lab enterprise
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:10.320]   moved towards was that, one observation was that
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.980]   if you take two-year-olds,
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.920]   if you take kids at different ages,
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.040]   you could imagine you made a group
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.280]   of two-year-olds, three-year-olds,
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.440]   group of four-year-olds, all the way up to 15.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.800]   You just let them interact.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.840]   The two-year-olds are the most aggressive,
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:26.720]   but if you analyze the two-year-olds themselves,
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.040]   you find that all the aggressive kids are boys,
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.880]   and it's only a fraction of them, about 5%.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.440]   So if you group two-year-olds together,
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.720]   5% of the boys will kick, steal, hit, and bite,
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.200]   which was our definition
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.640]   of early-onset antisocial behavior.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.640]   Almost all of those kids are socialized
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.240]   by the age of four, right?
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.800]   The remnant that aren't get alienated
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.000]   because they have no friends,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.280]   and they're the ones who become juvenile delinquents
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.920]   and then early-onset criminals,
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.320]   and then repeat offenders, right?
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.240]   And so what it is, is imagine there's some kids
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.040]   whose default, their rage circuits
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.880]   are a little bit more dominant than the typical kid.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.440]   They're often bigger physically.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.760]   - Yeah, especially the biting.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.600]   Forgive me for interrupting,
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.920]   but there's a very interesting paper published
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.480]   about two years ago showing that there's a specific circuit
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.200]   from the hypothalamus to the neurons
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.940]   that control jaw closure,
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.480]   that are independent of the neurons
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:29.560]   that control jaw closure for eating and for drinking,
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.240]   that are specifically for aggressive biting.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.200]   I mean, I hope people understand the significance of this,
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.520]   because what this means is there are dedicated circuits
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.360]   for aggressive biting in your hypothalamus.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.880]   We all learn to suppress these,
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.200]   except probably under conditions
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.600]   where our life is endangered,
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.240]   in which case you'd probably bite like hell
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.560]   in order to try and get out of that circumstance,
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.160]   but we are all born with this circuit.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.000]   We die with this circuit.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.320]   Most of us, apparently not these kids,
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.760]   learn to suppress this circuit.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.000]   - Right, right, or integrate it.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.280]   - An eight-year-old biter is a scary thing.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.120]   - Right, right, right.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.280]   - A one-year-old biter is like a little bit
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.120]   of a worrisome thing.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.120]   A two-year-old, like, okay, we need to work on this.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.360]   An eight-year-old biter, people are starting to be concerned,
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.880]   I think, even without knowledge
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.520]   of the psychopathology literature,
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.640]   one would be very concerned
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.240]   if their eight-year-old is biting other kids,
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.720]   not just because of the damage induced,
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.080]   but it's so very different and so much more primitive
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.000]   than even hitting or spitting or something.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.840]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.000]   It's the indication of a virtual absence
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.760]   of sophisticated socialization.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.360]   - They are truly in their hypothalamus.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.040]   - Yeah, yeah, right, exactly, and that's,
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.600]   well, especially if you have a hypothalamus
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.680]   that's tilted towards rage, let's say,
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   and defensive or predatory aggression, that's bad news.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   Now, so what's the upshot of that?
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:52.120]   Well, the upshot is that there is a, that's right,
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.840]   there's a subset of kids
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.840]   whose default reactions aren't socialized,
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.800]   and we associate that with psychopathy
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.160]   and long-term criminality.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.880]   It's a really useful thing to understand
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.940]   that much of what we see as pathology,
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.000]   and I would say the same thing about narcissism
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   and certain forms of hedonism,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.840]   essentially what it is is failure of socialization, right?
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.080]   And this has very interesting political implications
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.840]   because it also implies that,
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:22.840]   imagine that impulsive self-gratification is a personality,
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.880]   the desire for impulsive self-gratification
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.760]   is a personality with its own political opinions.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.620]   Nietzsche said in the late 1800s
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:37.620]   that every drive attempts to philosophize in its spirit.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.060]   Brilliant, a brilliant observation.
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:43.280]   Far different than conceiving of the,
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.680]   say, hypothalamic drives
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.880]   as deterministic chains of only impulses.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.600]   And another thing to consider, too,
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.880]   with regards to the effect
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.360]   of hypothalamic motivation on perception,
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.880]   that mouse that you talked about
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.960]   whose attack system is activated electronically.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.560]   See, when that glove is dropped,
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.440]   you can see that there's a relationship with perception
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.540]   because if there's no target for attack
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.860]   that's biologically relevant in the environment,
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.280]   there's no impulse.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.880]   So you could imagine that what happens
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.320]   is when you activate those neurons
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:18.560]   is that there's a set of perceptual stimuli
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.760]   that are much more likely to be classified
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.640]   as a defeatable enemy.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.560]   Now, even a glove will do it.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.080]   Right, right, so you drop in a glove
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.200]   and that's now perceived as defeatable enemy
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.280]   or perhaps threat 'cause we don't know exactly
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.560]   what the perception would be.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.720]   But then you see,
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.440]   then it's the perception driving the behavior.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.140]   That's not an impulse, right?
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.780]   That's more like a strategy.
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:46.020]   I really started to understand some of the literature
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.840]   on the evolution of religious thinking
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.140]   when I started to understand
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.300]   motivational states as personalities.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.860]   Because one of the things that you see,
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.300]   this is so cool,
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.860]   something I tried to talk to Dawkins about,
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.660]   the greatest historian of religions who ever lived
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:00.740]   was Mircea Eliade,
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.540]   and he wrote a sequence of brilliant books.
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.980]   "The Sacred and the Profane" is the best one to start with.
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.440]   Very short book, very elegant book.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:12.800]   And what Eliade documented across the world
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   was the pattern by which polytheistic belief systems
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.020]   turned into monotheistic belief systems.
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.320]   That parallels maturation.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.120]   It's the same thing.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.360]   And so the polytheistic gods tend to be
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:31.560]   representations of motivational states.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.400]   - I'm gonna pause you there
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.480]   'cause I think this is extremely important.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.160]   - So the god of war.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.080]   - Or the god of love.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.240]   - The gods of love.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.960]   - Exactly, exactly that.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.160]   - So the idea that the different gods
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.560]   are the reflective of different,
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.000]   we'll just say it as neuroscientists,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.640]   as different hypothalamic and related circuits.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.040]   - Well, why wouldn't they be gods?
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.600]   Beware of falling under their dominion.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.640]   Beware of becoming their playthings.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.880]   And the other thing that's very interesting, you see,
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.720]   is that you have to also understand
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:08.000]   that these don't exist independently of historical context.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.880]   So let's say rage.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:13.760]   It's like, there's a literature of rage.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.800]   There's a culture of rage.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.200]   There are patterns of rage
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.360]   that are played out in drama and literature.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.520]   Like, it's not only that the motivational impulse
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.560]   is a personality.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.080]   It's a personality with a history and a philosophy.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.760]   And if you don't think it can possess you,
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.480]   you don't know very much about possession.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.280]   So like, for example, if you're fighting with someone
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.600]   and you become enraged, as you said,
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.640]   your temporal purview shrinks,
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.320]   and your notion of what constitutes victory
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.160]   is radically transfigured.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.840]   So if you're fighting with someone you love,
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.240]   you might wanna defeat them or even hurt them,
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.080]   independently of the fact that you actually love them.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.040]   Well, then you think, well, you're gripped
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.600]   by these impulses.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:58.080]   No, no, you're inhabited by the spirit of rage.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.960]   And if you're a sophisticated person,
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.000]   there's gonna be an endless stream
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.720]   of sophisticated intellectual rationalizations
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.640]   that come along with that possession, right?
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.280]   It's full-fledged personality, and it's...
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:16.440]   One of the things you see with people who are psychotic,
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.040]   you know, who drift off into the landscape
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.600]   of their imagination is that they dwell
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.160]   on such states of possession.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:28.600]   So for example, these kids that shoot up high schools,
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:33.160]   like they're fantasizing under the influence of rage
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.680]   and resentment for thousands of hours.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.000]   That just takes control of them.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.880]   And it's not a simple impulse.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:45.560]   It's like, no, they've inverted the...
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.800]   You could think they've inverted the neurological order,
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.600]   and the god of rage is now the, what would you say,
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.560]   the leading personality of integration,
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.280]   or the god of resentful rage, even worse.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.400]   - And the circuit may run in reverse.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.220]   My colleague, David Spiegel,
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.560]   who's our vice chair of psychiatry at Stanford,
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.800]   has done some beautiful experiments
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.900]   examining the relationship
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:07.200]   between prefrontal cortical areas and the insula,
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.080]   a brain area that has a map of our internal body state,
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.840]   interoception, you know, our ability to sense
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.360]   our internal workings, et cetera.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.700]   In any event, there are certain conditions,
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.760]   including depression, where the direction of flow
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.840]   between the prefrontal cortex and the insula
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.920]   literally reverses.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.120]   It's like running against the typical traffic.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.320]   This is a very different example,
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.680]   because here you're presenting it
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.320]   in the context of rage, or sociopathy,
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.160]   and these kids who shoot up schools.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.680]   But I do absolutely subscribe to what you just said,
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.200]   that if one drops into one of these more primitive states
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.880]   and emotions, and all the things that go with it
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.360]   for a very long time, it's almost as if the governor,
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.680]   which is the prefrontal cortex,
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.440]   starts to become the governed,
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.720]   that the whole circuit starts to run from bottom up
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.400]   as opposed to top down.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.920]   And I think there's good neurological evidence.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.840]   - That's what happens in addiction.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.520]   - Right, and so you hit that circuit
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:01.120]   that's seeking the drug with repeated doses of dopamine.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.040]   You know, people say they have a monkey on their back.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.860]   It's like, no, they have a monster in their brain,
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:09.620]   and they grew it, and it grows because it's reinforced
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:12.280]   with dopaminergic hits, and as it grows,
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.440]   its capacity to dominate increases.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.740]   And so when there's a cue for the addiction,
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.580]   this is why people relapse when they get out
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:20.680]   of a treatment center.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.640]   They'll go back to their normal environment
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.560]   after having dealt with the physiological withdrawal,
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.920]   let's say, and a cued craving will make itself manifest
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.720]   like a friend they freebase with,
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.860]   and it's all of a sudden, whoom, that monster is alive,
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.720]   and it just shuts everything else down.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.200]   And it's got a personality.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.300]   It can lie.
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.000]   You know, one of the hallmarks of addictive behavior
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.200]   is lying, and the lies are the rationalizations
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.120]   of that sub-circuit, sub-personality,
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.600]   for its own pathological behavior.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.200]   And so, and that's all reinforced, too,
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.960]   by the dopaminergic hits.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.040]   - It's like there's multiple people in there.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:57.880]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.720]   - In everyone.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.760]   One of the most incredible-
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.360]   - Polytheistic paganism.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.280]   - Polytheistic paganism.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.720]   - Yeah, that's the default condition.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.080]   Right, right, that's the condition of the two-year-old.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.380]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.600]   and thank our sponsor, AG1.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.680]   AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral,
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.360]   probiotic drink with adaptogens.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.240]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.720]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.440]   The reason I started taking AG1,
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.240]   and the reason I still take AG1,
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.740]   is because it is the highest quality
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.640]   and most complete foundational nutritional supplement.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.640]   What that means is that AG1 ensures
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.880]   that you're getting all the necessary vitamins,
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.740]   minerals, and other micronutrients
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.440]   to form a strong foundation for your daily health.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.080]   AG1 also has probiotics and prebiotics
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.020]   that support a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.880]   Your gut microbiome consists of trillions
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.760]   of microorganisms that line your digestive tract
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.240]   and impact things such as your immune system status,
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.240]   your metabolic health, your hormone health, and much more.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.240]   So I've consistently found that when I take AG1 daily,
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.440]   my digestion is improved, my immune system is more robust,
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.080]   and my mood and mental focus are at their best.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.280]   In fact, if I could take just one supplement,
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.480]   that supplement would be AG1.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.880]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.120]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman

[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.800]   If you'd like to try AG1,

[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.300]   to claim a special offer.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.540]   Right now, they're giving away five free travel packs
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.080]   and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:26.560]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.320]   to claim that special offer.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:31.320]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.440]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.580]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.580]   I'm excited to share that Roka and I have teamed up
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.680]   to create a new style of red lens glasses.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.180]   These red lens glasses are meant to be worn in the evening
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.640]   after the sun goes down.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.360]   They filter out short wavelength light
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.800]   that comes from screens and from LED lights,
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.260]   the sorts of LED lights that are most commonly used
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:54.180]   as overhead and frankly, lamp lighting nowadays.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.520]   I want to emphasize Roka red lens glasses
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.420]   are not traditional blue blockers.
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.600]   They're not designed to be worn during the day
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.320]   and to filter out blue light from screen light.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.080]   They're designed to prevent the full range of wavelengths
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.280]   that suppress melatonin secretion at night
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.920]   and that can alter your sleep.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.360]   So by wearing Roka red lens glasses,
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.960]   they help you calm down
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.180]   and they improve your transition to sleep.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:19.200]   Most nights I stay up until about 10 p.m. or even midnight
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.900]   and I wake up between five and 7 a.m.,
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.780]   depending on when I went to sleep.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.820]   Now I put my Roka red lens glasses on
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.680]   as soon as it gets dark outside
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.380]   and I've noticed a much easier transition to sleep,
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:31.120]   which makes sense based on everything we know
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.500]   about how filtering out short wavelengths of light
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.760]   can allow your brain to function correctly.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.360]   Roka red lens glasses also look cool, frankly.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.360]   You can wear them out to dinner or to concerts
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.240]   or out with friends.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.000]   So it turns out it is indeed possible
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.640]   to support your biology, to be scientific about it
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.140]   and to remain social after all.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.840]   If you'd like to try Roka, go to roka.com,

[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:05.440]   One of the most remarkable real life examples
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.400]   I've ever witnessed of the power of belief in God,
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.080]   I'm just gonna say it as it occurred.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.800]   I have a good friend who for many years
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:19.160]   struggled with alcohol and drug addiction of multiple kinds.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:23.960]   Incredibly kind person, incredibly successful in his career
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.960]   married, two beautiful children, multiple relapses,
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.240]   crashed his truck at seven in the morning
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.800]   after getting intoxicated at 6.30 in the morning,
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.680]   got out of that one, happened again
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.440]   and again at multiple rehab centers
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.080]   of the sort of standard treatment, et cetera.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.620]   And then ultimately enough happened
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.280]   within that whole set of circumstances
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.880]   that his wife said, "This is it.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.600]   You've got to solve this or we just can't be with you."
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.800]   A very scary situation for everybody involved,
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.600]   including him who absolutely adored his family.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:02.680]   He told us, his friends, that he was going to go
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:07.540]   to a center here in Los Angeles that treats addiction
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.960]   with essentially religion, a belief in God.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.560]   He was already fairly religious.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.520]   Most Sundays he attended church and things of that sort.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.600]   And you can imagine we all thought, including myself,
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:24.200]   like, okay, dude, like, good luck.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.080]   I hope this works.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:29.200]   But like, I would say zero minus one confidence
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.920]   in his ability to get and stay sober.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.700]   He just had not succeeded prior to this.
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:37.560]   He's been sober more than four years now.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.260]   He got out of there and never looked back.
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:45.160]   And I wonder now whether something,
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.720]   something must've changed in his brain
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.360]   by adopting what was essentially a-
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.800]   - Different incentive structure.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.300]   - Right, different incentive structure,
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.960]   but fear wasn't doing it before,
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.160]   fear of extreme consequences,
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.960]   which were on the table at that time
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.120]   when he went in weren't enough.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.040]   Something about going there
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.120]   and the work that he did there allowed him to then,
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.260]   it's almost like he got another prefrontal cortex,
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.420]   a more powerful prefrontal cortex.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.780]   So maybe we could talk about that.
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.100]   - Well, that's not a bad way of thinking
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.340]   about what it is that people are trying to do
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.580]   when they say pray.
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:27.220]   So you can invite in spirits to possess you.
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:30.660]   That's a good way of thinking about it.
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.320]   I know that's odd terminology,
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:35.560]   but that's what you do when you dwell on your rage.
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.980]   Right, right.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:38.340]   Now imagine that you're doing that
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.660]   in the most positive possible direction.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.580]   So what you're doing is you're generating a hypothesis
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.140]   about the mode of conduct and perception
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:50.980]   that would best typify you if you were ideal,
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.560]   and then establishing a relationship with that
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.640]   and inviting it in.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.780]   That's what the evangelical Protestants are doing
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.720]   when they formulate a personal relationship
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:01.980]   with Jesus Christ.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.380]   That's exactly what they're doing.
[00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:04.620]   Now on the addiction side,
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:07.540]   so I studied alcoholism for years.
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:10.500]   That was the target of my dissertation
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.980]   in the first 20 papers that I published.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.100]   I knew the alcoholism literature very well,
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.220]   and the neurological end of it as well.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.620]   And it was known among alcohol researchers,
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:22.180]   it's been known for 60 years, more even,
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:24.300]   that the most reliable treatment for alcoholism
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.260]   was religious transformation.
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:29.220]   And this is well accepted among researchers in the field
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.820]   who have no religious affiliation whatsoever.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.980]   And I do believe that a huge part of that
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.420]   is a consequence of incentive restructuring.
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.020]   So you said, for example, with your friend,
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:40.740]   that fear wouldn't work.
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:44.420]   Well, alcohol's a pretty good anxiolytic drug,
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.100]   but it's also, for people who are prone to alcoholism,
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:50.980]   it's a good incentive reward source, like cocaine.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:54.700]   If you're going to, you can't get rats addicted to cocaine
[00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:57.220]   if they live in a natural environment.
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.860]   They have to be isolated in a cage
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:02.620]   before they'll bar press to their own death for cocaine.
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:05.220]   So one of the things you want to do when you treat addiction
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:08.260]   is you want to substitute a new incentive structure, right?
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.860]   Because the part of the addictive process
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:15.500]   is you fall into a false incentive pattern, right?
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.740]   'Cause cocaine makes you feel
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.660]   like you're doing something useful
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:23.180]   in respect to an important goal, even though you're not.
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:24.500]   It mimics that.
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.660]   - Even if you know you're not.
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:26.500]   - Even if you know it's irrelevant.
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.820]   - And I'll just say, I've never done cocaine.
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.020]   I would be open about it if I had.
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:32.480]   I think I like dopaminergic states enough
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.620]   that I've been very scared of doing it, frankly.
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.660]   Also, it wasn't around much
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.020]   just because of when I went to college.
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.520]   It just wasn't a drug that was around much.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.780]   But it's a remarkable drug in the sense
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.420]   that people who take cocaine
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.580]   seem to be excited about everything.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.480]   They're in this high dopaminergic state.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.460]   And their brain becomes exceptionally good
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.580]   at finding cocaine, even in the absence of resources,
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:55.700]   which is pretty remarkable if you think about it.
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.060]   Most people can't find the thing
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.060]   or get the thing they want
[00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.200]   in the absence of the resources to get it.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.460]   But people who take hard drugs
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:04.760]   that really spike dopamine somehow manage.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.620]   Yeah, sure, sometimes they lie.
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:08.960]   Sometimes they lie, cheat, and steal.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:09.800]   Lie, cheat, and steal,
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.100]   but they'll do other things too, right?
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.700]   They'll socialize with people that have it
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.220]   so they don't have to lie, cheat, and steal.
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:17.340]   It's incredible to see that drug
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:20.500]   and things like methamphetamine take over people's minds.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:21.820]   And now I'm thinking-
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.560]   - The pathway appears when the aim is firmly in mind.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.700]   - Right, see, this is another insistence
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.980]   that's derived from the religious literature.
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:35.420]   So, because the idea there is that if your aim is upward,
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:38.540]   the pathway forward to that will make itself manifest.
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.660]   And that's true.
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:41.740]   You just pointed out that it was true
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:43.300]   in relationship to addiction.
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:46.140]   Right, is that if once that,
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.920]   once you're in that realm of possessed personality,
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.060]   the pathway forward will show itself to you,
[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.180]   even under straitened circumstances.
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.700]   Right, and it's partly because
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.620]   you can think of our perceptual systems
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.320]   and our emotional systems, for that matter,
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.560]   as navigating tools.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:05.000]   Right, so now the addiction, the addicted brain,
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.920]   like they say, the aim is possessed
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.880]   by the substance of addiction, right?
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.520]   So now the highest god is cocaine, let's say.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.440]   And so now all pathways in the world
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.920]   are pathways to cocaine.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.400]   All objects in the world are markers
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.160]   on the pathway to cocaine.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.620]   'Cause it just dominates, but it's not just an impulse.
[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:26.480]   It dominates the perceptual landscape as well.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.400]   That's makes it, and the emotional landscape.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.920]   And it comes with all these rationalizations.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.080]   That's all those lies, right?
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.400]   The whole thing, it's a whole personality.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.600]   Yeah, brutal, brutal.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:42.600]   Nowadays, I get a lot of questions about pornography.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.320]   And the discussion around pornography
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.400]   is always related to the discussion around masturbation.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:52.280]   But let's just talk about pornography for a moment
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.980]   in this context of these primitive drives
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:56.580]   and these circuits within the hypothalamus,
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.500]   which we were all born with,
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:01.500]   that clearly some of them are devoted
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.100]   to our progression as a species through reproduction.
[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:05.420]   Zero question about that.
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.340]   Sexual behavior being linked to reproduction.
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:09.940]   Not always, but certainly we can all agree on that.
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.620]   It's a necessary precondition.
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:13.060]   I hope we can still all agree on that.
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:15.000]   But last time I checked, that's still true.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.780]   A sperm and an egg met someplace in some context
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:20.100]   to create all of us, okay?
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.540]   We're still grounded in that.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:27.520]   Pornography is something that I hear quite a lot
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:32.520]   from typically young males, but sometimes young females,
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:37.080]   or even older females who say that they can see themselves
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.400]   trying to resist the desire to go look at it.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:42.620]   And it almost doesn't feel like a desire anymore.
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:46.760]   They're sort of just in a kind of a compulsion
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.840]   that is almost unconscious,
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.160]   but they're just aware of the fact that they're-
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.000]   - Like an eating disorder.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:51.840]   - Like an eating disorder.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:52.660]   They're doing it.
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:54.120]   They know they shouldn't be doing it,
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.840]   and they can't help themselves.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.640]   And we could think about two ways to attack this
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.200]   if one believes it's a real concern,
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.280]   and they certainly do, so I do.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.880]   I don't, I would be open if I had or do.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:06.160]   Pornography has not been my thing,
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.400]   and I don't struggle with it.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.000]   But when I hear from these people,
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.760]   it's so clear that they're asking,
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.240]   is it the prevalence of pornography out there?
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.560]   Or is it something really broken in them?
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.880]   Like, are they broken?
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.040]   But I don't know that I would say
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.000]   after having the discussion we've had thus far
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.200]   that they're broken.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.320]   It seems to me that it's like the, as you said,
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.740]   it's the manifestation of one part of their,
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:33.040]   it's one personality within them.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.240]   - Well, and it's been compulsively rewarded.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:40.280]   So, you know, when you see yourself
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:44.040]   moving towards the culmination of a desired goal,
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:47.280]   a dopamine, that's accompanied by dopamine release, okay?
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.600]   And so two things, you know this,
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.640]   but everybody who's listening might not.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.760]   There's two elements to that dopamine release.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:57.160]   One is pleasure, but the other is that the dopamine,
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:01.480]   imagine that there are circuits activated as you're acting.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:04.080]   What the dopamine does is increase the probability
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.200]   that the circuits that were activated
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.860]   just before the positive experience happened grow.
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:12.700]   Okay, so now if you're engaged with pornography,
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:17.700]   and that culminates in successful sexual satiation,
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.480]   which it can, that's what masturbation does,
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.080]   then the whole personality that's oriented
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.760]   toward that set of stimuli is going to come to dominate.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.400]   It's very much like an addiction.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:31.880]   Except it's, you know, there has been,
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:35.440]   there's been work done with generally simpler animals
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.040]   on these phenomena called super stimuli.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:41.160]   I think it's stickleback fish where this was first observed.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.300]   So males, I hope I get this right,
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.240]   but I've got it approximately right.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:49.800]   I believe it's male sticklebacks will,
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.200]   they're very aggressive towards other male sticklebacks.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.560]   And the reason they're aggressive
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.060]   is because the other male sticklebacks
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.380]   have a red dot on their bellies.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.440]   So they don't like red dots at all.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.840]   And so you could really enrage a stickleback
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.040]   with a red dot.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.360]   And if you use a red dot that's a little bigger
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.060]   and a little brighter than the typical red dot,
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.560]   you get a super stimulus.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.320]   It's virtually irresistible to the stickleback.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:15.400]   And it's weird because the maximal activation
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.880]   is produced by a stimulus that they wouldn't see in nature.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:21.360]   It slightly exceeds, that's exactly what pornography does.
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.120]   It's a super stimulus, right?
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:26.000]   And it's not surprising that young males in particular
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.440]   are susceptible to that because male sexuality
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.640]   in human beings is very visually oriented.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.840]   Very, and a lot of our brain is visual,
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:35.360]   way more than virtually every other animal.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.760]   Certainly every other primate and every other mammal.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:43.320]   And so we have a situation where any 13 year old boy
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:47.480]   can see more hyper attractive super stimulus women
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:50.080]   in one day than the most successful man
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.920]   who ever lived a hundred years ago
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.920]   would have ever seen in his whole life.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.320]   Yeah, well, that's like an evolutionary,
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.880]   ecological, radical ecological transformation.
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:03.520]   And it's worse because it's easily accessible,
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.440]   so it takes no work, right?
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.580]   So not only is it a super stimulus,
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.680]   it's one that's at hand, so to speak.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:14.680]   - And the analog in the food world
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:18.720]   would be highly palatable, highly processed food.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.560]   - Yeah, sugar, fat combination.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.180]   - The other day I went into a gas station
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.760]   to use the restroom 'cause I was traveling home
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.720]   for Thanksgiving and I looked around
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:28.520]   and I thought this isn't a convenience store,
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.580]   this is a pharmacy.
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:31.840]   Everything that had chocolate
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.560]   also seemed to have caffeine and color.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.440]   Everything, every drink seemed to combine not just sugar,
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.740]   but also caffeine and some other things
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:41.360]   that would provide stimulants.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:43.160]   Then you've got nicotine. - Energy drinks.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.440]   - And these things on their own aren't necessarily bad,
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.600]   any one of these one elements,
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.020]   in low enough doses, in frequent use, et cetera,
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.400]   but maybe sugar being the one that clearly,
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:54.800]   I think, deserves deeper investigation, right?
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.760]   But it just occurred to me that--
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:00.960]   - There isn't much difference between manufacturing sugar
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.280]   and manufacturing cocaine.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.780]   I mean, you take something that's available
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:08.220]   in its natural form in relatively low concentrations
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.540]   and purify it.
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:12.420]   I mean, coca leaves, the natives used coca leaves forever
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.700]   as mild stimulant, didn't seem to cause them any trouble,
[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:17.980]   but that's way different than cocaine, right?
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:21.140]   And sugar has the same, arguably,
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:23.220]   the same pathological properties.
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:24.420]   - Well, I didn't think we were gonna go here,
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:25.980]   but I think it's extremely appropriate
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:27.580]   and important that we do.
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.980]   So I know that you followed
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:30.780]   what is essentially an elimination diet
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:33.340]   for a number of years, you eat meat, right?
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:36.740]   I eat meat, vegetables, fruit, and some starches,
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:38.820]   unrefined starches, in any event.
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:41.540]   One thing that I think is absolutely clear
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:45.860]   from following a clean diet, so to speak, of any kind,
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:49.100]   but let's say of the sort that you follow or I follow,
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:52.140]   is that you very soon learn the relationship
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:56.700]   between taste of the food, volume of the food,
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:57:00.380]   macronutrient, so protein, fat, or carbohydrate content,
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:03.860]   micronutrients, and satiation,
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:04.980]   which is, if you think about it,
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:06.700]   it's sort of like a big plate of broccoli
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:07.820]   or a big steak or something,
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:10.640]   the brain learns and the hypothalamus learns
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.780]   the association between the taste, the caloric content,
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.060]   what else is in there, and satiation.
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.620]   If you think about highly processed food
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:20.700]   or even combinations of multiple ingredients,
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:22.600]   that's absolutely impossible to do.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:26.060]   The brain can't parse what are the various things in here
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:28.260]   and how do they relate to my feelings of satisfaction.
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.260]   It's the difference between a super drug
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:34.980]   and what I believe are the elements that we have-
[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:39.420]   - Explain why you think that link about satiation
[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:41.820]   can't be learned in the case of these processed foods.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:43.900]   - Yeah, because in the context of these processed foods,
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:46.740]   they're activating multiple neuron systems
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:48.180]   in the hypothalamus and gut.
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:51.620]   We know that the gut has neurons that can respond to sugar,
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:54.060]   fatty acids, and amino acid content.
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:55.640]   And there's this prominent theory
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.140]   that one of the main reasons we eat
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.180]   is to forage for amino acids,
[00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:00.300]   that we'll eat until we get enough
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:02.180]   of the essential amino acids.
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:04.460]   And we correlate that with taste,
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:05.820]   but that the gut has neurons,
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:07.460]   where we know the gut has neurons
[00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:09.400]   that signal through the vagus up through a little relay
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:11.500]   called the no-dose ganglion, if you wanna look at it,
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:14.580]   fun name, and then up to the dopaminergic centers
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:16.220]   of the brain, which make us,
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:18.820]   oh, when we eat something that has a high
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:20.900]   essential amino acid content, like a steak,
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:22.700]   like a really tasty steak,
[00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:25.740]   the neurons in the gut in a way that is independent of taste
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:26.820]   are signaling to the brain,
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:29.220]   ah, I'm getting essential amino acids,
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:30.980]   you should eat more of this thing.
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:33.120]   If those, let's just say a small fraction
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.460]   of those amino acids that are present in a candy bar
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:38.300]   or in a package of Skittles,
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:40.820]   which I'm guessing there's very few of them, if any,
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.220]   you're gonna continue to forage for food
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:45.420]   because those neurons will also respond to sugar.
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:46.940]   Basically, it will keep you eating
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:48.620]   until you get enough of those amino acids.
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:50.580]   In other words, there are two parallel tracks,
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:51.420]   one within our taste system-
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:53.540]   - Multiple pathways to satiation.
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:55.380]   - Right, multiple pathways to satiation,
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:56.500]   one dependent on taste, - Of course.
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:59.060]   - one dependent on actual nutrient content.
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:02.100]   The mouth can only learn taste association.
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:04.680]   The mouth can't actually learn nutrient content.
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:06.720]   The gut knows nutrient content.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.900]   The problem is you take a food that is low
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:10.620]   in a micronutrient or macronutrient
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:12.580]   or essential amino acids or essential fatty acids.
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:14.740]   After all, there are no essential carbohydrates.
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:16.220]   There are only essential amino acids
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.300]   and essential fatty acids.
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:18.180]   - Right, right, right.
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.020]   - And it will keep you eating
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:22.500]   and it will keep the appetite system revving
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.260]   until you get enough of those.
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.180]   Now, here's the issue, if you've ever done this,
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.540]   it's probably been- - So that's empty calories.
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:29.540]   - Empty calories. - Yeah, oh yeah.
[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:33.140]   - So in some ways, this, again, is an analog
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.460]   to the whole discussion around pornography,
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:37.700]   masturbation, and reproduction, right?
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:38.700]   I'm not saying that reproduction
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.620]   is the be-all, end-all of sexual activity,
[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:43.820]   but in the evolutionary sense, it absolutely is, right?
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.020]   There's no question about that.
[00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:46.040]   There's no moral judgment there.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.000]   That's just the reality.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.540]   So the situation with food is the following.
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:56.540]   If we are eating without any gut-level understanding
[00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:59.180]   of what's coming in, we will keep eating.
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:01.200]   If you, let me give an example.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.940]   You probably haven't done this experiment in a while,
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.460]   but if you've ever just had rib eye steak or two,
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.340]   it's pretty satiating.
[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:07.920]   Maybe you also have a salad, if you're me,
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.720]   or some broccoli or something like that.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.180]   If one takes, then even after you've eaten all that,
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.980]   one bite of pasta, one bite of pasta,
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.540]   the next impulse is more, right?
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:21.780]   Even though you already have enough essential amino acids
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:24.420]   from those steaks, you're loosing threshold,
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.900]   you've reached that, et cetera, all of that good stuff.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.740]   Why?
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.500]   Because blood glucose goes up, and then you desire more,
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.160]   because blood glucose elevations are linked directly
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.700]   to the dopaminergic system.
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:35.380]   So what I'm basically trying to say here is that
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:38.540]   I do think that there are elements to our food,
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.700]   modern food, if you will.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.540]   It seems like it's anything but modern
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:42.700]   in the sense that it's worse for us
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:43.820]   than the more primitive foods,
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:47.120]   but highly processed foods, pornography,
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.820]   any drug that spikes dopamine dramatically,
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:52.800]   like methamphetamine, for instance,
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.420]   any behavior that spikes dopamine dramatically
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:58.260]   that very quickly hijacks these circuits.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:01.680]   And to me, the way to teach those circuits
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.120]   a calmer, more prudent version of themselves, right?
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.660]   To enter a different hypothalamic activation pattern
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.680]   is to start breaking the things down
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.780]   into their essential elements, right?
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:15.780]   About the motivation, the pleasure, et cetera,
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.380]   to tamp all that down.
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:19.380]   I mean, we know that for pornography,
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:21.060]   if the pornography is very extreme,
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.180]   then less extreme pornography doesn't seem to work.
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.300]   - Well, that's 'cause there's also a novelty kick
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:28.140]   in dopaminergic striving, right?
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:33.140]   I mean, so with any basic appetitive pleasure,
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:36.940]   there's a dopaminergic kick.
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:39.980]   But with any novelty, there's also a dopaminergic kick.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:42.440]   So there's an optimized threshold for novelty
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.700]   and appetitive striving that plays out in pornography.
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:50.700]   So there's the direct effect of the stimulus as such,
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:56.620]   but there's variation in the stimulus that's also novel.
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:00.500]   And so it's a common pattern for pornographic usage
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:05.500]   to become more, what would you say, fetishistic.
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.120]   That's one way of thinking about it as it progresses,
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.440]   because that keeps the novelty alive.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.780]   Right, that's very dangerous.
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:13.280]   That's a very dangerous development.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.060]   - Right, and I would venture in a very different domain
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:16.900]   that if you were to eat your steak slathered
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.540]   in barbecue sauce for a couple of weeks,
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.420]   going back to the way that you eat them now,
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:22.260]   which by the way, this is a great opportunity
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.740]   to educate people about something that you taught me
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.140]   when we had dinner last,
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.700]   which is that if you're gonna order a steak,
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.500]   order a Pittsburgh char.
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.940]   The char on the outside is incredibly tasty.
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.460]   - Right, right. - We love that,
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:36.460]   the umami taste, we should have a devoted taste receptor.
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:37.540]   - It's complex. - Yeah.
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.500]   So, and if they don't know what a Pittsburgh char is,
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.880]   then maybe you're in the wrong restaurant
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:41.800]   or you need to educate them,
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.980]   but incredibly satiating, delicious, right?
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:46.940]   But if you were to slather those steaks
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:50.580]   in a bunch of things, I would suspect that after a while,
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:52.140]   your plain steaks wouldn't taste as good.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:52.980]   - Oh, certainly.
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.560]   - But the way to make them taste good again
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.020]   would be to eat them plain for a period of time
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:00.260]   in which the stuff, all the condiments, et cetera,
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:01.460]   would start to become aversive.
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.580]   I do believe that when we return
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:08.580]   to the sort of most naturally satisfying mode
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:11.780]   of engaging with these circuits,
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:13.840]   here we're talking about food and sex in parallel,
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.700]   that they become especially satiating.
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.900]   And I think that, you know,
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:19.900]   in hearing from all these people
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:21.820]   that are addicted to pornography,
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:24.100]   and they're not addicted like it's telling me they love it
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:24.940]   and they can't stop.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.700]   They're telling me it's no longer working for them,
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:27.900]   that there's this, you know,
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.340]   diminishment in the amount of dopamine
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.300]   that they're getting over time
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.660]   and they feel trapped within it.
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.520]   And they have no sense whatsoever
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.740]   because they haven't been socialized to,
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.620]   to go out and find a real relationship,
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.780]   a real sexual relationship or a relationship of any kind.
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:42.660]   - Well, it's also, there is some evidence suggesting too
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.900]   that if you've been socialized into pornography sexuality,
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.120]   it's actually quite difficult
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.380]   to establish a sexual relationship with an actual partner.
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.740]   Now, I would say to some degree,
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.320]   that's always been difficult
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.820]   because it's a complex form of behavior.
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:00.240]   But the introduction of pornography,
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.980]   well, it sets up a whole landscape of expectation,
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:05.140]   for example, that's not necessarily gonna play out
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:07.620]   that well in the real world, let's say.
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:09.700]   - And there's also a learning
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.300]   of those biological systems in the brain
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:15.140]   to evoke arousal by observing sex
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.940]   as opposed to participating, right?
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.060]   Completely different.
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:19.900]   So some of these-
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:21.340]   - Right, that's voyeur, right?
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.540]   You're basically learning to be a voyeur.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:24.380]   Right, right.
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:25.580]   - And so you think about young brains
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:28.880]   that are highly plastic, learning that.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.720]   So the returning-
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.380]   - Yeah, we have no idea what to make of that
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.020]   because especially for young men,
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:34.660]   because when they hit puberty,
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:39.060]   sexuality becomes a very insistent force.
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:42.580]   And we have no idea what effect pornography
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:46.220]   has on the development of male sexuality, none.
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:49.540]   - I've wondered for a while
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:54.180]   whether there's something inherently rewarding
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:59.180]   about creating impact or action at a distance.
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:00.580]   Here's why.
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:03.340]   I've been watching these videos of Elon's rockets
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:07.700]   and thinking like, that is awesome.
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:09.500]   That is awesome.
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.220]   - We're built on a throwing platform.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:14.700]   - Yeah, just there's one image of the rocket thrusters
[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:16.060]   that just captivated me.
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.860]   I'm not a spacecraft guy.
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:19.140]   I mean, I think it's really cool,
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:20.740]   but I wouldn't consider myself somebody
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:24.120]   that looks at the stars and thinks I wanna go up there.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.600]   I might if I'm given the opportunity,
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.660]   but that's not been my thing.
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:27.900]   But I looked at this and I thought,
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:30.420]   what an awesome display of power.
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:31.900]   But then I was saying like, what is power?
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.660]   It's really about having impact or action at a distance.
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:35.500]   When we were kids, we liked-
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.320]   - Targeted.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.160]   - Dirt clod wars, right.
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:37.980]   - Targeted impact at a distance.
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:38.820]   - Targeted, right.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:41.340]   What an incredible display of funneling the laws
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.460]   of physics and engineering into something
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.880]   that can have enormous action at a distance
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.360]   and perhaps even take us into new galaxies.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.140]   Amazing, right?
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:53.900]   - The word sin in many languages means to miss the target.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:58.140]   Right, and it speaks to exactly what you're describing.
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:03.140]   Like that, the cache of action at a distance,
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:06.060]   that's unbelievably deeply embedded in us.
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.520]   That's why I made that throwing gesture.
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:12.260]   Like human beings throw, that's our physiology, right?
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:14.740]   We can throw something at a distant target.
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:17.900]   Well, that's structured our cognition.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:21.140]   We're using our thoughts to hit distant targets.
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:22.380]   That's what we do.
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:24.220]   All the games that young men play,
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:26.380]   so many of those games are target games.
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.940]   All of the sports spectacles
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.100]   that people wanna participate in vicariously,
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:34.580]   even vicariously, they're target hitting games.
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:38.000]   Like our gaze specifies as the center of a target.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.640]   There's targets everywhere.
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:43.680]   And we're unbelievably focused on bridging the gap
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.800]   between where we are and where we're going.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.000]   Yeah, that's the whole perceptual landscape.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.440]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.140]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:54.760]   I recently became a Function member
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:57.040]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.080]   to lab testing.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.000]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.960]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.600]   for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.480]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.240]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.520]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.920]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.680]   Function not only provides testing
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.120]   of over a hundred biomarkers,
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.800]   key to physical and mental health,
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.640]   but it also analyzes these results
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:26.200]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:29.060]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:32.180]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.500]   This was totally surprising to me.
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.300]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:38.160]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.660]   but offered medical doctor-informed insights
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:43.340]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:45.660]   which included limiting my tuna consumption,
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:47.420]   because I had been eating a lot of tuna,
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.760]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.660]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:54.740]   both of which can support glutathione production
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:58.480]   and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.060]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.460]   is so important for health.
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:03.260]   And while I've been doing it for years,
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:06.180]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.660]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:09.560]   both at the level of ease of use,
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.100]   that is getting the tests done,
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:14.000]   as well as how comprehensive and how actionable
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.420]   the tests are, that I recently joined their advisory board.
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:19.660]   And I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:20.960]   If you'd like to try Function,
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:24.260]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:27.860]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:29.440]   but they're offering early access
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.680]   to Huberman Lab listeners.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.960]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:36.360]   to get early access to Function.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:39.340]   So this thing about action at a distance, to me,
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:41.720]   feels like so inherent to our progression as a species.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.160]   Most technologies are about that.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.040]   In fact, if you think about social media,
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.700]   somebody tweets something and when people react to it,
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:49.860]   maybe positively or negatively,
[01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:52.460]   the school shooter in a very dark example,
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:54.440]   a sad or tragic example, right?
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.120]   Action at a distance.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.120]   Then you think about pornography and masturbation,
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.740]   and I'm not passing any moral judgment here.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:04.500]   It's like the ultimate form of creating action
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.520]   at a distance would be to create a new human being
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.120]   with somebody, right?
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.740]   I mean, you're propagating it in physical distance,
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.240]   creating a new being, and in time, right?
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.480]   I mean, incredible.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.320]   And then you think about masturbation
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.240]   and you think about pornography,
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.200]   and there is no action at a distance.
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.760]   And I'm not just punning here.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.800]   I mean, literally, there's not much action at a distance.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.000]   It's all up close to oneself,
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.520]   but there's no impact on anybody.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.680]   It's almost as if the energy that we're born with
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.760]   to be able to create positive things,
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:39.040]   to evolve our species through action at a distance,
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:42.240]   through creation of knowledge, technology,
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:45.960]   children, communities, culture.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.000]   - It's the ultimate expression of sterility.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.960]   - It's just looped back into oneself.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:53.180]   It's as if, and I don't know what language there is
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:54.760]   for this in biology, but it's as if
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.880]   all that dopaminergic drive is just kind of looped back
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:59.240]   into oneself and it goes nowhere.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:02.040]   And I think when I hear about the incredibly,
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:05.960]   what the language for it is only like the diminished souls
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.760]   of these people who are coming to me saying like,
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.680]   help, and I'm thinking, okay, listen,
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.840]   I'm a podcaster, I'm a scientist.
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.480]   I know some things about the dopaminergic system,
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.280]   but there are ways that they can get help.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.360]   I think there are 12-step programs for this and so forth
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.480]   and other things, but I think what they're saying
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.880]   is that they're just kind of dissolving
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:28.840]   in their own reflex,
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.120]   but there's no action at a distance for them.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.000]   This is the same thing I see with the failure to launch kids
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.200]   who are still living at home,
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.800]   who are not having any action at a distance.
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.280]   I think we were designed to disperse from our families
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.040]   and to create action at a distance up until a certain age.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.040]   But I see so many of the problems that we face
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.880]   as failure to find a productive way
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:52.720]   to have action at a distance.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.560]   - Well, that's a failure venture, I would say,
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.960]   in the terminology that I've been developing.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:00.100]   So, for example, in this book,
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:01.780]   in We Who Wrestle With God,
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:07.040]   one of the stories I analyze is the story of Abraham,
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.520]   and it's a very interesting story psychologically.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:12.280]   I mean, I think it's stunning, actually,
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.120]   and I'll lay some of that out for you
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.320]   and tell me what you think about it.
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.920]   So, the divine is characterized
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.920]   in the classic stories of our culture as the ultimate up.
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:31.840]   So you can think about the divine as the target as such,
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.840]   rather than any particular target.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.640]   So here's a way of thinking about it.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.020]   So an ambition will seize you,
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:41.240]   and then you'll aim at fulfilling that ambition,
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.560]   but once the ambition is fulfilled,
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.720]   a new ambition makes itself manifest,
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.880]   which might be a greater ambition, let's say,
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.820]   if your personality's expansive,
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:52.640]   and then if you fulfill that, the same thing will happen.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:56.120]   So then you could imagine that there's a meta-ambition
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.600]   behind all proximal ambitions.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.320]   Okay, now the divine,
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.880]   characterization of the divine
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.360]   is a characterization of that meta-ambition.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.160]   That's a good way of thinking about it.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.820]   So it's something that recedes as you approach it,
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:12.320]   but it's also the thing that all ambitions have in common.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.560]   And we know there is such a thing,
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.400]   because otherwise we wouldn't have a concept of ambition,
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.120]   which speaks to a commonality among ambitions.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.000]   Okay, in the story of Abraham,
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.800]   the divine is characterized in relationship
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.660]   to something like ambition.
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:32.400]   So Abraham has the,
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.360]   he's already imbursed in a situation
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:39.360]   that's akin in a way to the scenario of a wealthy
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.200]   and a person in the modern world
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.460]   who's in a situation of abundance.
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:48.000]   Abraham's parents are wealthy, and they provide for him.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.860]   There's nothing he needs to do.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:54.080]   And in consequence, so he's attained the socialist utopia
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.520]   or the consumerist utopia.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.380]   You can look at it either way.
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:02.520]   And there's no reason for him to move forward.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.420]   So he doesn't.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.960]   He doesn't do anything till he's 75.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.600]   And then the voice comes to him,
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.000]   which is the voice of adventure,
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.960]   and it's God in this story.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.920]   That's how God is defined, right?
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.380]   And God says to Abraham,
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:21.600]   "You have to leave all this comfort,"
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.520]   which is a very interesting proposition to begin with.
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.160]   It's like, why the hell would you leave that
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.080]   when you have everything you need?
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.960]   Well, the implication is that
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.480]   you don't have everything you need
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.380]   when you're being delivered everything you need.
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.160]   That isn't how life works.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:41.040]   So God says, "You have to leave your father's tent.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.480]   "You have to leave your tribe.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.700]   "You have to leave those who speak your language.
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:47.120]   "You have to venture out into the world."
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:52.120]   So God is conceptualized in this story as the impulse,
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:56.220]   the voice that compels you out into the world
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:58.380]   and that encourages you to do so.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:02.340]   So that's a hypothesis about what the ultimate up is.
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:07.120]   And Abraham agrees, and he does so in two ways.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:12.120]   He builds an altar signifying his aim,
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.900]   that he's going to abide by the command of this voice
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:18.260]   or the invitation of this voice,
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:22.140]   and that he'll make the appropriate sacrifices.
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:25.200]   It's a crucial, it's a crucial,
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.820]   it's a crucial point to understand
[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:31.440]   because the process of transformation requires sacrifice.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.860]   To be more than you are means you have to let go
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.600]   of that which you were.
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.780]   You have to make sacrifices.
[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:39.720]   Now, Abraham's life is punctuated by a sequence
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:42.820]   of reaffirmations of his upward aim
[01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:46.540]   and declamations of his willingness to sacrifice.
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:48.380]   Every time he finishes an adventure,
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:51.620]   he reconstitutes the covenant, right?
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:55.120]   So this is this agreement to follow the voice of adventure.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:55.960]   Okay.
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.140]   God makes him a deal, that's the covenant.
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:00.460]   It's a very interesting deal.
[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:03.380]   So now imagine, biologically speaking,
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:06.740]   that there is an instinct to integrate
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:08.460]   that operates within us.
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:12.340]   Okay, so now it's not, it's just as fundamental
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:16.020]   as the hypothalamic motivational states, let's say,
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.540]   but it's more sophisticated.
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:19.420]   And what it's trying to do is to integrate
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:24.420]   all the motivational states across time and socially, right?
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:28.060]   And then imagine it manifests itself as an instinct,
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:31.540]   to be something like the instinct to mature, right?
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:32.860]   To move forward, right?
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:35.140]   To leave your zone of comfort, right?
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:38.220]   And maybe there have been people like Csikszentmihalyi
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:41.700]   who've characterized that as the attractiveness of flow,
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:46.100]   and maybe it's associated with the exploratory circuit
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:48.900]   in the hypothalamus that's mediated by dopamine.
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:51.580]   Okay, but it's got its character.
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:56.120]   Now, the character of that instinct in this story
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:00.100]   is the way it's characterized is as the voice of adventure.
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:02.160]   So it's the thing that asks you to move
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:05.540]   beyond your zone of comfort and go into the foreign world.
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:10.540]   Now, the advantage to that is that you fortify yourself
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.080]   and you develop, right?
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.220]   So no matter how good you are now,
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:16.260]   if you push yourself to the edge,
[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:17.820]   you're gonna be better than you are.
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:22.480]   And that's a better win than merely being good
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.860]   like you are now.
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.320]   So that would be participation
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.080]   in that transformative process
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.860]   is a higher form of attainment
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:32.060]   than mere attainment of any specific goal.
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:34.760]   Okay, so that's the call to adventure.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.280]   That's the call to a quest.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.800]   That's what Gandalf offers Bilbo, for example.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:44.180]   Okay, God characterizes the consequences of that.
[01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:45.680]   And this is so cool.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.380]   When I figured this out, it just flattened me.
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:48.760]   It's so interesting.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.560]   God says, okay, if you,
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:53.980]   God is defined as that which says this, by the way.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:58.360]   If you push yourself beyond your zone of comfort,
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.280]   even if it's functioning for you,
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.780]   that's Abraham's situation, here's what'll happen.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.380]   You'll become, you'll live your life
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:07.860]   in a manner that's a blessing to you.
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:09.120]   So that's a good deal, eh?
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.840]   Because lots, the miserable people you're talking about,
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:14.420]   the depressed people, the trapped people,
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:16.520]   their life isn't a blessing to themselves.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.440]   So what's a pathway to blessing?
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:21.520]   Well, it's not satiation, not in this formulation.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:25.320]   It's voluntary, it's the voluntary quest.
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.060]   And it's characterized by adventure.
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.660]   So that's deal number one.
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:30.960]   You'll live in a life that'll be a blessing to you.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.000]   Okay, and then God says, that's not all that'll happen.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.980]   You'll be a blessing to yourself in a manner
[01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:42.900]   that will make you renowned among other people, justly.
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:45.440]   So that's a good deal, because we know that people,
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.800]   men in particular, are very status-oriented,
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.920]   partly because their reproductive success
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:54.200]   is highly correlated with their social status,
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.060]   and the psychopaths game that,
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:59.480]   but still, it's like, renown is crucially important.
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.920]   You wanna be the quarterback
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:03.520]   on the shoulders of your teammates, you know?
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.960]   So that'll be the second thing that happens,
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.520]   and then the same voice says, and that's not all.
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:12.000]   You'll be a blessing to yourself and be renowned
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.280]   in a manner that will maximize the probability
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.400]   that you will establish something of lasting value.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:20.400]   That's a good deal, so that's stretching across time,
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.720]   multi-generationally, because God tells Abraham
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.520]   that if he follows the pathway of adventure,
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.800]   he'll be the father of nations.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.800]   So what that means is that he'll establish
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:31.560]   the pattern of paternal conduct
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:36.560]   that will maximize the success of his offspring
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:41.040]   in the longest possible run, 'cause that's so cool.
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.520]   This is success at a distance and over time.
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.840]   Exactly, and then the final offer is,
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.680]   you'll do that in a way that'll bring abundance
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.440]   to everyone else, too.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:52.560]   Now, so think about what that means biologically.
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:56.420]   This is so cool, and I can't see how it can be wrong.
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:59.720]   It means that if you hearken to the voice
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.600]   that calls you out of your zone of comfort,
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.940]   and you do that voluntarily,
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:05.200]   so you put yourself on the edge of adventure,
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:08.280]   you will be following the instinct
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:10.880]   that has already evolved to make your life
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.480]   a blessing to yourself, to make you successful
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:16.360]   among other people, to maximize your probability
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.460]   of long-term success, and to do that in a way
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:20.600]   that brings abundance to your community.
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:21.960]   And then you think, look,
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.640]   let's take the contrary hypothesis.
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.840]   The contrary hypothesis would be twofold.
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:29.040]   There is no compulsion to adventure.
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.000]   It's like, that seems highly improbable.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.440]   Or that the compulsion to adventure
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:37.080]   isn't aligned with psychological and social well-being.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:40.880]   Well, what's the chance that the fundamental drive
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:44.720]   that would facilitate your transformation across time
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.440]   would not be aligned with your psychological integrity
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.160]   and the success of the community?
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.960]   Like, we wouldn't be social animals if that was the case.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:56.320]   So as far as I can tell, that has to be true.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:01.060]   Now, that doesn't mean you can get lost in false adventures.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:01.900]   That can happen.
[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:06.040]   That's what an addiction is, or that's what pornography is.
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:07.400]   It's a false adventure, right?
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:10.680]   It's failure to hit the proper target, you might say.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:15.160]   But that central drive to integration
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.960]   across time and communally,
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.480]   why wouldn't that be an instinct?
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.040]   And then we could cap that with an observation
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.500]   that I also think is self-evidently true
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.320]   once you understand it.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.400]   So imagine that you're a father.
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.080]   Now, this spirit of adventure
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.880]   is often characterized paternally, right,
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:35.800]   insofar as God's the father in these ancient stories.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:36.980]   So think about this.
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:39.400]   So when you see your son,
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:40.640]   now, it's also true of your daughter,
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.680]   but I'll focus on sons for the moment.
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:45.640]   When you see your son, and you love your son,
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:50.640]   when you see your son pushing himself beyond his own limits
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:54.120]   in an adventurous manner, if you're a good father,
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.400]   you definitely encourage that, right?
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:00.000]   And I would say, insofar as you encourage that,
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.440]   you are a good father.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.720]   And that would mean that you're the embodiment
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:06.160]   of that spirit that calls to adventure.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.400]   That's why Abraham is characterized, for example,
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.120]   in this story as forging an alliance
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.760]   with the spirit of his ancestors,
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.740]   with the deity of his ancestors.
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:18.880]   He's embodying the call to adventure,
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.920]   and that's what makes him the father
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:23.420]   whose reproductive enterprise is successful
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:26.160]   across the broadest possible span of time.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:30.320]   I think that's, I just can't see how that can be wrong.
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.000]   And that's a characterization of the divine.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.560]   There's other, it complexifies it,
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.480]   because what the stories are trying to do
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:40.360]   is to give you an image
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.720]   of what that integrating personality might be like,
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.900]   and it's sophisticated,
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:47.200]   so a single characterization is insufficient.
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.860]   So in the story of Noah,
[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:54.760]   God is, this personality is characterized quite differently.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:58.700]   So Noah is presented as a man who's wise in his generations,
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:00.960]   which means that for his time and place,
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:03.960]   he's moral and reputable.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.600]   So he's the sort of guy that people would go to for advice
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.920]   because he's lived a life
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.520]   that's emblematic of his wisdom, let's say.
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:14.600]   Okay, now, a voice comes to him and says,
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.040]   batten down the hatches there, mate.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.520]   Trouble's coming.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:21.100]   Okay, so here's the hypothesis.
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:24.000]   The hypothesis is the voice that calls to the wise
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.760]   to prepare in times of trouble
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:28.120]   is a manifestation of the divine,
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.960]   and it's the same as the voice
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.800]   that calls the unwilling to adventure.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.560]   That's the monotheistic hypothesis,
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.760]   and so you can see what the imagination is doing
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:40.480]   is agglomerating these different characterizations
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:41.800]   of high aim,
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:45.080]   insisting that there's an integrated unity behind them,
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.840]   and then trying to conceptualize
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:49.720]   that integrated unity across time.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:51.840]   And so, and I think that's done,
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.840]   I think that's done with radical success
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.340]   in the biblical library,
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:59.720]   that the culmination of the library of stories
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:04.280]   is the impressionistic representation
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.040]   of this integrating pattern,
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.760]   and I think that's what people call on
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:11.040]   when they're engaging in a religious enterprise
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.880]   that is radically successful,
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:16.120]   like that happened in the case of your friend, right?
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.920]   So he got a new personality,
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:21.360]   and that new personality had different incentive structure,
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.600]   and so that just superseded the addiction.
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.800]   It's almost as if, I mean,
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.200]   I realize that for people listening,
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.520]   it might not seem like this,
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:32.360]   but to us, his friends who had seen him try so hard
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:35.160]   in the context of people he truly, deeply cares about,
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.280]   more than anybody in the world, his children, his wife,
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:41.160]   it was almost like he got a brain transplant.
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.400]   It was astonishing.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.640]   How does he account for it?
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.440]   Like, if you asked him, like,
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:51.440]   okay, you had every reason to change, and yet you didn't,
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.280]   and then all of a sudden you did,
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.280]   like, how does he understand that?
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:00.280]   - He uses very Christian religious language.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:06.560]   He said that he felt Jesus's love for him,
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:09.540]   and he saw an image of who he could become.
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:12.400]   This was important, perhaps, no doubt,
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.080]   and not just perhaps, but no doubt,
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.000]   of who he could become.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.360]   - And that was worth it.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:22.360]   - And he had the adequate social support within this place,
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.040]   and so there was reinforcement,
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:28.680]   but what's remarkable is that he was able to take that
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:31.080]   outside of this place.
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:34.200]   It was a residential facility, out of this place.
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:35.040]   - And carry it with him.
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:40.000]   - And to this day, he is rock solid in that domain,
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.600]   and I will say in all the other domains of his life, too,
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.400]   extremely successful as an artist.
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.640]   I don't want to out him.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:49.160]   You know, extremely successful as a commercial artist,
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:52.760]   and happy, and in service,
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:57.160]   and just seems like he got a brain transplant.
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.640]   - Right, so there's a mystery there
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:24:59.920]   that's kind of threefold.
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:03.080]   One is, what the hell did he mean
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.640]   that he realized that Jesus Christ loved him?
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:07.560]   Right, that's okay, what do you mean by that?
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:10.640]   And then somehow that's associated with the vision
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.560]   he developed of who he could be,
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.140]   if he was everything he could be.
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:16.640]   There's a relationship between those two things.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.280]   And then there's this third mystery,
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:23.120]   is the culmination of those two phenomena,
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:24.500]   freedom of his addiction,
[01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:27.240]   even out of the context of the center.
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.080]   - That's right.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.320]   - Very difficult to understand that.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:34.320]   But you know, we know, think about it this way.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.240]   If you're possessed by rage,
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:40.720]   different phenomena have dopaminergic cachet to you
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.160]   than if you're possessed by, like, sexual desire.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.800]   Like, obviously, right? - Absolutely.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:50.680]   - Right, so the idea that a given stimuli
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:54.480]   produces a given motivational response is incorrect
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.520]   because that's framework dependent, right?
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.240]   And then most, so I think one of the best ways
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.160]   to understand a motivational drive
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:05.320]   is that a motivational drive grips the target.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.600]   It establishes the target, right?
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:11.880]   And it may increase the probability
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:14.720]   that certain action patterns will make themselves manifest.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.440]   That would be kind of a compulsive element.
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:19.600]   But fundamentally, what it's doing is changing the target.
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.880]   That rearranges the perceptual landscape
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.440]   and it transforms the emotions.
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.520]   Because now, if your target is there,
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:30.120]   things that lead you there are dopaminergically relevant.
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:31.560]   If your target is there,
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.640]   things that lead you there are relevant.
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:38.640]   Same underlying emotion, but the stimuli, so to speak,
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:41.080]   that give rise to the emotion are radically different.
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:44.520]   So now, he has a different orientation and aim.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:49.000]   And so, the incentive structure of his psyche
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.680]   is radically transformed.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:52.880]   Now, we know that can happen because that happens to you
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.160]   when you move from one motivated state to another.
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.600]   - I think in 12-step programs,
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:00.120]   they allow the steps to be milestones.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.880]   I mean, there's clearly a dopaminergic component.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:04.360]   I hope people understand that dopamine is dumb.
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:05.840]   In fact, dopamine isn't dumb.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.000]   Dopamine has no intelligence at all.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.800]   It's just a currency of motivation and reward.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.960]   - Which is why it can be gamed by cocaine.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.400]   - Which is why it can be gamed by cocaine
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:19.600]   or most anything that can ferret its way
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.320]   into the hypothalamic system.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.880]   And I hope people picked up on what you said before
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:28.880]   because it's so important that as one moves toward a target,
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:32.040]   dopamine increases en route to that target.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:34.320]   I'm rephrasing what you said before.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.040]   You said it wonderfully.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.640]   I just wanna make sure people understand
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.200]   that as that dopamine increases,
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:42.160]   the probability that your perception
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.960]   will go to something other than the target
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.840]   decreases exponentially.
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.480]   As you get closer and closer,
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.640]   you get more and more dopamine.
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.120]   The greater the elevation in dopamine,
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.920]   the lower the probability that you'll engage
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:55.400]   in any other pattern of self.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:58.120]   It's like it's almost, or personality type,
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.480]   other than the one that you're engaged in
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.480]   in pursuit of this behavior will emerge.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:04.800]   - Not least because as you approach successfully,
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.400]   the probability of ultimate success is obviously increasing.
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.400]   So it makes perfect sense that you would narrow in focus.
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.800]   You run faster as you see the finish line.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.920]   - Right. - Faster and faster.
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.800]   This concept of sin as missing the target
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.040]   or this definition of sin, I think is incredibly important.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.360]   - Hamartia is the Greek word
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:24.000]   and it's literally an archery term,
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.200]   but it's also the word for sin in ancient Hebrew
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.880]   is also an archery term.
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.520]   And there's other languages where that's the case,
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.400]   but it's really important to understand
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:37.000]   that that notion is predicated
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.360]   on this target seeking psychophysiology.
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.040]   And that that's unbelievably deeply built into us
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:47.320]   as you pointed out, our eyes are target established.
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.080]   Well, it's so important to us
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:52.960]   that we infer aim from gaze, right?
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.640]   And it's more than that.
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:58.240]   Not only do we infer aim from gaze,
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.960]   we mimic the psychophysiological state
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.320]   of the target that we're watching
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:06.920]   as a consequence of our inference of aim from gaze.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:09.760]   So if I can see what you're looking at,
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:13.080]   then I can occupy the same psychophysiological state
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:15.880]   that you do and that's the basis of my understanding.
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:17.040]   - Oh, this is so important.
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:20.240]   And there's something that I've never talked about
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.480]   on this or any other podcast,
[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:23.240]   which is that in humans,
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:25.400]   we have a massive expansion
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.760]   of an area of the frontal cortex
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.440]   called the frontal eye fields.
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.520]   So there is circuitry deep in the brain.
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.520]   If you wanna look it up, it's superior colliculus.
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.560]   It's also called the tectum.
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:34.760]   In other species, it means roof.
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.720]   It's the roof of the midbrain, et cetera,
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:38.880]   that generate reflexive eye movements.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:41.140]   You stimulate in there, it's like a machine.
[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:42.920]   In fact, a colleague of mine
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:44.720]   who's now retired at Stanford, Eric Knudson,
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.440]   who did some beautiful work on neuroplasticity,
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:48.360]   was describing an experiment
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.520]   where they take out the frontal cortex of these owls.
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:54.480]   Owls are because they don't have much eye movements.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.880]   They move their head almost all the way around, right?
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.240]   We've all seen that.
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:02.240]   And they use this for homing in on their targets.
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:06.160]   The owl or a monkey or a human
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:08.000]   in the absence of a prefrontal cortex
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.280]   or suppression of prefrontal cortex becomes like a machine.
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:11.320]   You click here, they look there.
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:12.160]   - Right, right. - Click here,
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:13.140]   they look there.
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:14.320]   Puppies are like this.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.720]   Kittens are like this.
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:16.860]   Everything's a stimulus.
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:17.700]   Why?
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.440]   Because there isn't that top-down inhibition
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.480]   of those reflexes.
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:21.960]   In humans, we have an area-
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:25.800]   - That's why a cat with no brain is hyper-exploratory.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:28.180]   - Right, everything's a target.
[01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:29.160]   - Everything's a target. - Everything's a target.
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:30.160]   - Everything is a target.
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:32.400]   - And there's no context-dependent learning, right?
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:35.360]   I love that you gave the example of the decerebrate cats.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.920]   They even can do fictive motion.
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:38.040]   They can walk on a treadmill
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.560]   and it's like with no cortex.
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:40.400]   It's amazing. - Yeah, right?
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.720]   It is amazing. - Makes you rethink the cortex.
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.120]   - Yeah, that's for sure.
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:45.320]   - And humans have these frontal eye fields
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:46.640]   which are an evolved area.
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:47.840]   They're present in other species too,
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.160]   but they're massively expanded in humans.
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:53.680]   So this is a cortical area, a frontal cortical area
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.520]   devoted to controlling gaze
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.840]   and the context and control of gaze.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:01.000]   So it no longer becomes just a reflex that you can suppress
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.280]   as in the case with an adult cat versus a kitten
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.680]   or a dog versus a puppy.
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.720]   The frontal eye fields actually regulate
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:09.720]   all sorts of context-dependent like,
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:11.480]   oh, like he's looking at me directly.
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:13.360]   Is it aggressive? - Yeah.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.920]   - Well, then maybe I'll activate my aggression
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:17.000]   or maybe I'll brace my defenses or,
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.380]   wow, we came to this party together,
[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:22.800]   but she seems super interested in like directing her gaze.
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:23.920]   How are we inferring this?
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.120]   Sometimes it's body language.
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:25.960]   Sometimes it's this.
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:26.880]   Sometimes he looked at her.
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.440]   There are all these memes about this, right?
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:29.640]   - Right, right, right. - Right?
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:31.920]   The famous look over the shoulder meme
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.320]   that seems to have taken over the internet
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.480]   from time to time. - With the appropriate
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:36.400]   facial response. - Right, exactly.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:41.400]   So humans have a massively expanded notion
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:44.800]   of what gaze is and our ability to control gaze
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.180]   and understanding of gaze.
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:48.860]   So when you raise this idea,
[01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:50.240]   that when you raise this fact, rather,
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:53.280]   about gaze defining the target
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:55.800]   and that looking at others' gaze
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:58.560]   allows us to understand what they are defining
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.600]   as the target, we started to get into notions
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.800]   of theory of mind and things of that sort.
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.280]   So what that implies,
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.480]   in keeping with our previous conversation,
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:10.720]   is that as you mature and your cortex integrates
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:13.620]   and you become cortically dominant,
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:17.920]   the targets of your gaze become voluntary, right?
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:19.760]   This is a big deal because it means
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:22.600]   that you can concentrate on the distal,
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:25.260]   let's say, the temporally distal,
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:27.600]   at the expense of the proximal.
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:32.080]   So if you're walking down the street
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:34.520]   and you hear a loud and sudden noise behind you,
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.360]   you'll do an anti-predator crouch and then turn
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.680]   and you'll do that, essentially, automatically.
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:41.600]   - So curl up. - Yeah, and then turn.
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:42.440]   - Like turtle up and then look.
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:44.640]   - And you turn to the place
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:47.300]   where your stereoscopic audition has indicated
[01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:49.680]   that the noise emanated from, right?
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.640]   And that's automatic.
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:54.160]   That's the control of the eye, gaze,
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:57.040]   and bodily posture by those underlying.
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:58.480]   - Yeah, this is a superior colliculus.
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:00.720]   It has a map of auditory world.
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:01.920]   So when you hear something to your right,
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:02.760]   you turn to your right.
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:04.960]   - Right, right, and you do that before you think, right?
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:08.640]   Okay, so that's an activation of the eye fields,
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:12.780]   let's say, by these underlying motivational systems
[01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:15.160]   that have this personality-like autonomy.
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:19.560]   But you can orient your,
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:20.880]   part of the religious enterprise
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:23.760]   is to orient your eyes heavenward.
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:24.820]   Well, what does that mean?
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:25.840]   Well, you can think about it.
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.800]   It means to search out the North Star
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:30.540]   that navigates for you unerringly,
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:33.360]   regardless of the situation at hand.
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.280]   Imagine you could progress towards a target
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:37.840]   in a manner that made all the potential targets
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:40.640]   that you could progress toward more likely.
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:41.880]   It's a meta-target.
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:44.240]   You said that's what happened to your friend, right?
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:47.020]   Is not only did he dispense with his addiction,
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:50.760]   but all of the other enterprises that he was associating,
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:53.840]   that he was pursuing in his life became more effective.
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:54.840]   - It's almost like,
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:01.340]   it is as if every goal was like elevated.
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:02.180]   - Right.
[01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:04.600]   - And it's funny because for the first couple of months
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:06.540]   that I was interacting with him, I thought,
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:07.380]   - Okay.
[01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:08.500]   - Like he's different.
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:09.340]   - Yeah.
[01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:11.220]   - And I thought, you know, like most people would,
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:14.740]   you know, perhaps would think like, all right, let's see.
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:16.540]   Let's see, but this has been four years now.
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:20.360]   He's very consistent with his program.
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:21.780]   He, you know, he's involved in a program
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:22.620]   that keeps him on track.
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:23.940]   - Right, right, right.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:25.900]   - But he's elevated.
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:27.500]   And he's not talking above people.
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:29.020]   It's like, he's elevated, but he's grounded.
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:31.340]   When you talk to him, he's not kind of off some other place.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:33.060]   He's actually very, very present.
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:33.900]   - Yeah.
[01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:36.340]   - And even his text messages are very much of like,
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:37.560]   what's going on today?
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.980]   You know, asking questions that are very much of the now.
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:40.820]   - Yeah.
[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:43.800]   - And it's been a remarkable thing to observe.
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:44.640]   - Well, so-
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:48.180]   - Because he was about as down in his addiction
[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:52.860]   and had so much to lose and had essentially risked it
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:56.940]   over and over and over to the point where, you know,
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:59.020]   I didn't think it was ever gonna turn around.
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:01.440]   And all of his friends thought the same.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.180]   And his wife, of course, is delighted
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:04.140]   and his kids are delighted.
[01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:04.980]   - Of course.
[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:07.060]   - And I can say this without revealing,
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:09.460]   'cause no one knows, I'm godfather to his son.
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:11.740]   And his son is thriving, which is wonderful to see.
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:13.700]   And I just think of sometimes about how badly
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:15.520]   it could have gone the other way.
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.360]   - Yeah.
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:17.180]   - And it's fantastic.
[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:19.180]   It's like, he's nothing short of spectacular.
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:23.740]   - Okay, so let me put that into a context of,
[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:25.460]   let's say, an archetypal story.
[01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:28.100]   Okay, so I did a course for Peterson Academy
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:30.300]   on the Sermon on the Mount.
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:35.300]   And the Sermon on the Mount, it's a meta-goal strategy.
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:37.260]   It's very practical.
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:38.380]   It's very, very practical.
[01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:40.500]   And it emerges out of the biblical tradition
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:42.460]   in a very grounded manner.
[01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:43.980]   It's a logical extension
[01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:47.660]   of the biblical ethical precursors.
[01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:50.680]   So what Christ says to his followers
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:52.940]   in the course of the Sermon on the Mount is,
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:57.240]   first, orient your eyes upward.
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:00.780]   Okay, so that's in alignment with the notion
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:03.500]   that the firstborn is to be consecrated to God.
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:04.420]   There's a meaning to that.
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:06.660]   And the meaning is something like this.
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:10.220]   Imagine that your life consists of a sequence of episodes.
[01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:12.780]   Okay, an episode has a beginning and a middle and an end.
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:16.060]   The beginning sets the frame for the episode.
[01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:17.700]   So at the beginning of an enterprise,
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:20.140]   you want to lift your eyes heavenward
[01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:23.360]   so you establish the highest possible goal
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:25.940]   so that that constitutes the frame of perception
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:26.780]   for that episode.
[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:27.860]   That's the idea.
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:30.500]   That's why the firstborn should be consecrated to God.
[01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:34.020]   So for example, to think about it prosaically,
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:37.420]   before we sat down for our podcast,
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:40.420]   because we've done many podcasts,
[01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:43.620]   we strive to inhabit the framework
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:46.260]   that will make the podcast most radically successful.
[01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:48.500]   Now, you could imagine that that could be subordinated
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:51.900]   to either of our proximal desire for an increase
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.820]   in short-term personal fame, right?
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:57.740]   Or we could try to dominate each other in the conversation.
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:00.620]   Or we could orient ourselves properly
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:03.180]   and we could do what we could to pursue
[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:06.100]   the track towards revelation, so to speak,
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:09.020]   and we could elevate our conversation in that manner.
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:11.180]   Okay, and that would set the frame for the conversation.
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:14.140]   And the good podcasters always do that, right?
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:15.980]   They're not playing games.
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:17.180]   Or if they're playing games,
[01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:19.040]   it's of the highest possible order.
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:20.300]   It's a quest.
[01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:22.020]   Yeah, okay, quest for what?
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:23.660]   Enlightenment, for truth, right?
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:25.060]   For mutual understanding.
[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:26.760]   And then maybe for the education
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.460]   of those who are participating.
[01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:32.660]   All right, so Christ says first orient your eyes upward,
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:34.580]   right, and that's to love God above all.
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:36.860]   So whatever that upward divinity is,
[01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:38.900]   you establish an allegiance with that
[01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:41.940]   and you allow that to determine your perceptions
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:43.060]   and your motivations.
[01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:45.580]   Next, operate under the assumption
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:49.600]   that other people like you participate
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:54.600]   in that nature of that utmost aim and treat them that way.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:59.580]   Next, concentrate on the moment.
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:02.500]   Right, right, and that's exactly right
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:04.220]   because it's exactly right because
[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:09.000]   when you specify your aim,
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.620]   the pathway makes itself manifest.
[01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:14.340]   Otherwise, you could never use your senses to orient.
[01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:16.660]   You'd never get anywhere, right?
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:19.500]   So if you aim upward to the best of your ability,
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:22.900]   then the pathway upward is what will make itself manifest
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:23.740]   in front of you.
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:25.220]   Then you have to attend to it.
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:28.740]   And so then you get this weird perverse optimality,
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:30.860]   which is you're focused on the
[01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:35.700]   longest temporal scale
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:37.540]   and the highest possible elevation
[01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:40.620]   and you can make most use of what's right in front of you.
[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:45.220]   And that, the implication in the Sermon on the Mount
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:47.920]   is that there's no difference between that
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:50.280]   and participating in life eternal
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:52.380]   as it unfolds in the moment.
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:55.340]   And I think that seems to me to be exactly right.
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:56.620]   It's exactly right.
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:59.460]   And so, you know, I was thinking of that
[01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:01.220]   because you said your friends,
[01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:04.140]   all of your friends' endeavors had become elevated.
[01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:07.340]   So imagine that one problem you might wanna solve
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:10.000]   is what your goals should be.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.300]   But a much deeper problem would be
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:14.260]   how do you conceptualize your goals
[01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:16.260]   in relationship to one another
[01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:19.660]   across the broadest span of time and person
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:23.340]   so that every goal has the highest probability of succeeding?
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:25.260]   So that would be like the pursuit of a metagoal.
[01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:28.460]   I would say that's what defines the religious enterprise.
[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:30.540]   There's another variant of that, for example.
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:33.300]   So a variant of that would be
[01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:35.980]   not how do you solve the problem
[01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:39.100]   of any given thing that terrifies you,
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:40.700]   but how do you solve the problem
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:43.540]   of the class of things that terrify you?
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:46.340]   And the dragon fight mythology
[01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:48.900]   is the solution to that problem.
[01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:53.860]   So the attitude there is you adopt the stance of voluntary,
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:57.180]   what, a voluntary approach in the face of terror
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:59.940]   because that's the best metastrategy, right?
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:03.060]   And that's the strategy that works to protect you
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:07.380]   across the largest possible array of dangerous situations.
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:10.380]   This is what we learned as clinical psychologists
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:13.260]   with exposure therapy, right?
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:16.300]   You find the particulars of what someone is afraid of.
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:18.620]   That turns out to be somewhat irrelevant.
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:21.220]   You teach people to voluntarily confront
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:22.420]   what they're avoiding,
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:24.000]   and that doesn't make them less afraid.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.300]   It makes them more competent and braver,
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:28.740]   and that generalizes, right?
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:32.220]   And so, yeah, the religious pursuit is the pursuit
[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:34.940]   of meta goals in relationship
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.260]   to positive and negative emotion.
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:38.220]   That's a good way of thinking about it.
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:40.360]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:42.940]   and thank one of our sponsors, Element.
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:44.460]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:47.140]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:49.340]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:52.760]   and potassium in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:54.820]   We should all know that proper hydration is critical
[01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:56.780]   for optimal brain and body function.
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:58.940]   In fact, even a slight degree of dehydration
[01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:01.340]   can diminish your cognitive and physical performance
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:02.740]   to a considerable degree.
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:04.660]   It's also important that you're not just hydrated,
[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:06.720]   but that you get adequate amounts of electrolytes
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:08.020]   in the right ratios.
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:10.380]   Drinking a packet of Element dissolved in water
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:11.740]   makes it very easy to ensure
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:13.060]   that you're getting adequate amounts
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:15.100]   of hydration and electrolytes.
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:17.380]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of both,
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:18.980]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[01:41:18.980 --> 01:41:20.960]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:22.260]   when I wake up in the morning,
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:24.940]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:27.080]   I'll also drink a packet of Element dissolved in water
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.520]   during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing,
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:31.620]   especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:33.820]   and losing water and electrolytes.
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:34.700]   There are a bunch of different
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:36.140]   great tasting flavors of Element.
[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:37.900]   I like the watermelon, I like the raspberry,
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:40.180]   I like the citrus, basically I like all of them.
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:41.540]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:44.940]   you can go to drinkelement.com/hubermanlab
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:46.700]   to claim a free Element sample pack
[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:49.100]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:52.300]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/hubermanlab
[01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:53.820]   to claim a free sample pack.
[01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:59.820]   - I love this idea of looking upward and defining,
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:04.920]   or at least having a sense that there's a internalization
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:07.020]   of the greatest possible outcome.
[01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:09.500]   And when I say greatest, both for oneself,
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:11.340]   but also for the community, right?
[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:12.820]   - Yeah, that's life more abundant,
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:15.420]   or that's the symbolic terminology,
[01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:18.840]   or life in eternity, both of those are the same thing.
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:21.180]   So imagine you're fighting with your wife.
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:23.420]   Okay, now you're dominated by rage.
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:26.380]   Now, the advantage to that is you're ready.
[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:30.380]   But the disadvantage is you're going to strive
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:32.340]   for proximal victory.
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:34.940]   Okay, now, you don't wanna be a pushover.
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:36.420]   That's a mistake.
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:37.900]   So then what could you do instead?
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:40.540]   You could pause, and you could remember,
[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:43.940]   okay, if this could rectify itself
[01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:48.240]   in the best possible manner, what would that look like?
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:49.920]   Well, it's complicated, right?
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:52.300]   You don't want your wife to be defeated,
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:54.060]   and you don't want to be defeated,
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:56.580]   and you wanna solve the problem,
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:58.100]   but you don't wanna sweep it under the rug.
[01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:01.160]   You wanna solve it in a way that's solved,
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:02.940]   that works across time,
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:05.980]   that benefits your relationship in an upward manner.
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:07.780]   - And you have to make sure that you're not hijacked
[01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:10.340]   by that hypothalamic circuit or personality,
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:11.820]   as you've described.
[01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:15.180]   - If you don't alter your aim, you will be,
[01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:16.580]   because you need to substitute.
[01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:18.740]   You gotta think, I'd really like to win this.
[01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:20.800]   Like, I'd seriously like to win this battle.
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:23.900]   It's like, no, you need something better than that victory,
[01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:28.900]   and that would be a victory that would deepen
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:31.980]   and enrich your relationship and help it grow across time,
[01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:32.980]   and then you can remember that.
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:34.260]   It's like, I'm gonna listen.
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:38.220]   Even though I think my wife is wrong, I'm gonna listen,
[01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:41.320]   and I'm gonna see if I can find a pathway in the argument
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:43.380]   that makes our relationship better,
[01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:45.700]   and then you think, now, you have to really want that,
[01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:47.020]   because if you really want that,
[01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:49.780]   if you got that vision fleshed out properly,
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:52.200]   you'll want that more than you'll wanna win,
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:53.720]   and then you might say, well, why?
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:55.600]   It's like, 'cause it's a better deal.
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:57.760]   So there's one of Christ's parables
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.560]   where he talks about a pearl of great price,
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:03.000]   which is the pearl that a rich man
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.640]   would sell everything he owns to possess,
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:08.640]   and it's something like a reference to that.
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:12.560]   It's like, why would you ever attain a proximal victory
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:14.720]   if you could attain an ultimate victory?
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:15.960]   That's the battle, let's say,
[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:20.980]   between the salvation of the soul and the victory in sin.
[01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:23.740]   That's how the religious language would portray it.
[01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:26.180]   Well, you can win a local victory,
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:28.860]   and it looks like you win,
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:32.000]   but if you forego the ultimate game,
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.380]   that's not a victory, that's a defeat, obviously.
[01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:36.740]   It might even be a worse defeat than if you lost.
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:37.580]   - Absolutely.
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:40.420]   I've been spouting off on social media
[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:41.620]   and podcasts for a while now
[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:44.020]   that any big inflection in dopamine
[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:46.480]   that isn't preceded by a lot of effort
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:50.160]   to generate that dopamine inflection is very dangerous.
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.160]   Think drugs, think pornography,
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:53.840]   think highly processed foods.
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:56.640]   Think anything that creates this big sense
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:59.080]   of indulgence and pleasure without any effort
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:02.480]   is running counter-current to our evolutionary wiring.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.400]   Now, you could say, well, okay,
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:04.240]   so what are we supposed to do?
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:05.420]   Move into caves?
[01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:07.960]   - No reward without commensurate sacrifice.
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.720]   - That's right, of some sort.
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:12.080]   And the other issue,
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.680]   and it's coming up again and again today,
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:14.600]   and I love that it is,
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.940]   is this notion of the temporal domain
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:20.160]   of rewards that exist over multiple timescales
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:21.200]   or broader timescales.
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:24.560]   One of the things that I feel truly lucky for
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:26.560]   is the fact that I went the path of science
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:29.200]   where, we were chuckling about this earlier,
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:31.960]   a project could take a year,
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:32.880]   then you have to restart
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:34.680]   'cause that project went nowhere,
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:36.260]   and then you finish the project,
[01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:38.200]   you submit a paper, the review.
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:42.260]   The reward schedule in science could take four years.
[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:43.560]   It's not just about getting a degree,
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.580]   like getting papers through sometimes took a year,
[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:47.800]   sometimes took two years.
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:49.120]   Sometimes things didn't go well
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:50.340]   and you had to publish it in a journal
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:52.080]   that you wouldn't have wanted to,
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:55.540]   or sometimes you had to abandon projects altogether.
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:46:00.300]   So my reward system was trained up on lots of timescales,
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:02.440]   short, medium, long timescales.
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:04.040]   As I've moved into podcasting,
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:07.220]   the temporal loops are shorter, they're faster.
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:12.860]   But nonetheless, we do long-form content.
[01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:16.060]   But I think platforms like X, I think are wonderful
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:16.940]   if used appropriately.
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:18.960]   I think it's especially great nowadays, frankly,
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:21.780]   and Instagram, et cetera, they're very useful.
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:23.220]   But they train us,
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:25.260]   and I imagine they've trained the young brains
[01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:27.380]   that were weaned on them, 'cause I wasn't,
[01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:32.000]   but that were weaned on them for fast temporal timescales.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.740]   This isn't like playing a long poker game.
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:35.900]   This is like playing the slot machine
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:37.720]   over and over and over, right?
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:39.740]   It's not like a four-day tournament.
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:42.140]   - Complete with intermittent random reinforcement,
[01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:44.260]   which is what happens when something goes viral
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:45.100]   unpredictably.
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:45.940]   - Right. - Right, right.
[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:47.660]   It's really, yep, yep.
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:49.940]   - And then, of course, we have this notion in this country
[01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:52.340]   that in any moment, it could be a rags to riches
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:55.380]   or some overnight fame-type thing
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:57.820]   that exists as a possibility in our culture
[01:46:57.820 --> 01:46:59.460]   in a way that it hadn't prior.
[01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:03.020]   So I think that one of the things that could be useful,
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:04.580]   just venturing a hypothesis here,
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:07.900]   is that young and older people
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:10.900]   could take a look at their life and ask,
[01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:15.900]   over what variation of timescales do I derive reward?
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:17.060]   - Yeah, definitely. - You know,
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:19.920]   training for a marathon is a longer timescale
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:20.760]   of rewarding death. - Well, that's also
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:22.240]   a hallmark of maturity. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:24.100]   Yeah, school, a degree, et cetera.
[01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:27.020]   In business, the timescales are sometimes fast,
[01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:28.620]   sometimes short.
[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:31.700]   - I think you can ask even a better question than that.
[01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:32.800]   The better question would be,
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:34.180]   and this is kind of what's referred to
[01:47:34.180 --> 01:47:35.180]   in the Sermon on the Mount,
[01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:38.060]   is how could I optimize my long-term view
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:40.860]   while maximizing my focus on the moment?
[01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:41.940]   'Cause then you get both.
[01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:44.620]   That's a really good deal, right?
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:47.100]   Because now you're conducting yourself in a manner
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:52.100]   that works in an iterated way that's socially productive,
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:55.660]   right, and maybe intergenerationally socially productive.
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:57.420]   That would be the best thing to establish.
[01:47:57.420 --> 01:47:59.740]   That's kind of what you're doing as a good father.
[01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:00.980]   But you're doing that in a manner
[01:48:00.980 --> 01:48:04.980]   that enables you to also derive maximal impact
[01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:07.620]   from each step you take forward in the present.
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:11.380]   So, Carl Friston told me,
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:15.020]   we were talking about entropy and emotion.
[01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:16.940]   And I'd figured out a few years ago
[01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:18.060]   with a couple of my students
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:21.980]   that anxiety signifies the emergence of entropy,
[01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:24.140]   like technically, which I was really thrilled about
[01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:27.020]   because it gives emotion a physical grounding,
[01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:28.660]   like a real physical grounding.
[01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:30.740]   And Friston surprised me because he said
[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:34.700]   he has a theory of positive emotion that's analogous.
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:36.300]   He also knew the negative emotion.
[01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:38.780]   He'd also been working in that domain.
[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:40.540]   He said that you get a dopamine kick
[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:44.220]   when you reduce the entropy in relationship to a goal.
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:45.860]   And I thought, oh my God, that's so cool
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:48.660]   because it means that uncertainty is entropy.
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:50.380]   When it emerges, you get anxious.
[01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:53.620]   But when you see yourself stepping towards a goal,
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:54.780]   you get a dopamine kick.
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:57.500]   And the reason that's related to entropy
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:49:02.500]   is 'cause with each successful step you take towards a goal,
[01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:06.340]   you reduce the uncertainty of the pursuit,
[01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:08.900]   which is manifested in that phenomena you described,
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:10.780]   which is when you see the finish line,
[01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:12.340]   you start running faster.
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:15.100]   Right, so they're both related to entropy.
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:17.500]   - Well, to have goals at multiple timescales,
[01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:20.660]   you need to be able to, I love this entropy argument.
[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:24.740]   It makes total sense that you want to be able
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:29.740]   to withstand the periods of time when you don't know
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:32.900]   whether or not things are becoming more or less uncertain.
[01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:33.740]   - Yeah, yes.
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:36.140]   - This is part of becoming an adult, if you will.
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:38.300]   - Okay, okay, so yeah, that was exactly the thread.
[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:40.060]   So there's two corollaries of that.
[01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:42.980]   One is that the more valuable the goal
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:45.300]   towards which you're progressing,
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:48.480]   the higher the dopamine kick per unit of advancement.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:52.220]   So what that means is you want an ultimate goal
[01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:56.260]   operating in the domain of each proximal sub-goal.
[01:49:56.260 --> 01:49:58.620]   And that's what happens with this upward orientation.
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:01.680]   It's like what you're trying to do is to make things
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:04.300]   as good as they could be, whatever that means,
[01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:06.540]   over the longest possible span of time
[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:08.940]   for the largest number of people, you included.
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:11.140]   Now, you're not gonna know exactly how to do that,
[01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:12.740]   but that can be your goal.
[01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:15.380]   Okay, now that's gonna inform your perceptions
[01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:17.260]   and your perceptions of pathway,
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:19.400]   but it's also gonna modify your reward system
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:22.500]   because now every proximal step forward
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:24.860]   is an indicator of entropy reduction
[01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:26.620]   in regard to that meta-goal.
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:28.520]   Well, there isn't any, by definition,
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:30.100]   there isn't anything you can do
[01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:31.460]   that's more exciting than that.
[01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:34.460]   See, that kind of explains why your friend
[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:36.280]   was able to pop out of his addictive frame
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:40.220]   because now he's doing something that's so worthwhile
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:42.460]   that the temptation of alcohol, let's say,
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:44.140]   pales in comparison.
[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:44.980]   Right, right.
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:47.380]   - Right, it's a rewriting of the reward contingencies.
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:48.820]   - Yeah, yeah, right, exactly.
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:51.220]   And now you could imagine that,
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:53.820]   you could imagine a situation where a culture
[01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:57.340]   explores across time to find out
[01:50:57.340 --> 01:50:59.940]   how to characterize that goal
[01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:02.700]   such that if that goal is pursued,
[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:04.380]   people integrate psychologically
[01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:06.660]   in a manner that integrates them socially
[01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:08.380]   across large spans of time.
[01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:09.660]   I think that's what happens
[01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:12.660]   when the monotheistic revelation emerges.
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:17.460]   That's what's happening from a biological perspective
[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:19.100]   is that we're starting to characterize
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:20.900]   the longest-term goal.
[01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:22.900]   Yeah, something like that.
[01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:25.340]   - This is why I believe that pornography
[01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:27.460]   is potentially so poisonous
[01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:31.940]   because the level of uncertainty is basically zero.
[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:32.780]   - Yeah.
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:35.100]   - People can access what they want to see.
[01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:37.260]   They can keep foraging until they find it.
[01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:38.080]   - Yeah.
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:42.180]   - And that's not the way that relationships work.
[01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:45.460]   The way relationships work is I ask somebody out,
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:47.060]   they might say yes, they might say no.
[01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:49.300]   You go out on a date, they might not want a second date.
[01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:50.140]   - Well, and that's all very-
[01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:50.960]   - Things could progress.
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:52.500]   You might think that you're on the path to one thing
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:54.060]   and it turns out it doesn't work
[01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:55.800]   or you're not compatible.
[01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:59.380]   That's also extremely salutary
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:01.820]   because if you're being rejected,
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:03.420]   like say you're a foraging male
[01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:06.940]   and you're being rejected all the time
[01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:08.900]   and you forego that for pornography,
[01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:10.940]   what you're foregoing is the corrective
[01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:12.820]   that all those women are offering you.
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:15.940]   Like they're rejecting you because there is something wrong.
[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:18.060]   Like seriously, there's something wrong.
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:19.560]   And now you escape from that.
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:20.620]   You think, well, that's a relief
[01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:21.800]   because no more rejection.
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:24.500]   It's like, yeah, no more rejection,
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:26.800]   no more learning, no more improvement
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:30.860]   and no possibility of an actual life.
[01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:32.500]   - No action at a distance.
[01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:33.700]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:37.020]   No distal accomplishment, right?
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:38.400]   - Yeah, the only implication
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.660]   of the pornography masturbation scenario
[01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:43.300]   is that is more pornography masturbation.
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:44.700]   That's the only implication of it.
[01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:46.460]   That's all that possibly could arise.
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:48.260]   - It's worse than that
[01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:51.940]   because it's more pornography in a degenerating game
[01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:55.740]   'cause as you said, you have to chase that novelty edge.
[01:52:55.740 --> 01:52:57.380]   - Otherwise dopamine is driven down further.
[01:52:57.380 --> 01:52:58.460]   - Well, and that means what?
[01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:01.060]   It's gonna get more and more extreme?
[01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:03.100]   Well, that's not a good scenario.
[01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:03.980]   That's not a good,
[01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:06.180]   like what do you mean more and more extreme exactly?
[01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:07.180]   Like where does that end?
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:10.940]   Well, you know, a casual glance at online pornography
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:13.740]   can give you some real insight into where that ends.
[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:16.900]   Like that's a bottomless pit
[01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:21.140]   and in the most pernicious possible manner
[01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:25.500]   because sexuality can definitely twist itself
[01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:27.700]   into pathological forms
[01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:29.780]   that undermine psychological integrity
[01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:31.500]   and demolish society.
[01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:33.980]   - No, we see this with people who are highly successful
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:37.540]   who seem to have lots of areas of their life regulated
[01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:40.580]   and then, you know, they collapse their lives.
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:44.260]   And we sometimes see it with drugs of abuse as well.
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:47.560]   Although unless those drugs of abuse are dopaminergic
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:51.200]   and people have them in check, so to speak,
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:53.400]   which is exceedingly rare.
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:54.240]   - Yes.
[01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:55.800]   - It's usually just a matter of time
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:57.160]   and they don't reach the mountaintop.
[01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:00.160]   - Yes, well, time is the problem as we've been pointing out.
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:01.520]   Let me tell you another story.
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:03.200]   This is from Revelation.
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:06.800]   So Revelation is a vision of the end of time.
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:09.240]   Okay, now time ends all the time.
[01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:11.080]   Like our adventures end, our lives end,
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:12.360]   our relationships end.
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:14.720]   So the end has a pattern.
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:17.120]   Okay, Revelation is a vision
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:20.280]   of the eternal pattern of the end.
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:23.040]   So here's an element of the vision.
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:24.740]   It's so remarkable.
[01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:27.520]   I figured this out with my friend Jonathan Paggio.
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:30.360]   So there's a vision, a sub-vision
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:33.640]   in the sequential dream of Revelation
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:37.780]   of the Scarlet Beast and the Whore of Babylon.
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:40.160]   And it's very relevant to our discussion on pornography.
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:42.060]   You'll understand it right away.
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:46.200]   So it's a vision of how society disintegrates.
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:48.560]   Okay, now imagine when society disintegrates,
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:51.560]   men disintegrate according to their pattern
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:54.240]   and women disintegrate according to their pattern.
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.600]   That makes perfect sense, right?
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:57.980]   Because if society disintegrates,
[01:54:57.980 --> 01:54:59.960]   it's gonna be men and women who disintegrate.
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:01.820]   There's no reason to assume that their pattern
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:04.000]   of disintegration would be identical.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:09.000]   Okay, Scarlet Beast, that's the Scarlet Beast of the state.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.280]   That's Babylon, let's say.
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:13.480]   That's the degenerate, tyrannical state.
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:15.000]   It has multiple heads.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:15.840]   Why?
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:18.240]   'Cause whatever united it has vanished.
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:19.400]   That's like the death of God.
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:20.240]   It's vanished.
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:22.340]   And so now it's got heads in every direction.
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:23.440]   So it's confused.
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:28.040]   And it's red, scarlet, because that confusion,
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:31.360]   that disintegration is the precursor
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:33.240]   to the river of blood, right?
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:35.920]   The Red Sea, the swamp of chaos.
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:39.680]   So when the patriarchal state disintegrates,
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:42.960]   it loses its unity, and then it's multiple heads, right?
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:47.960]   And that's the emblem of descent into diverse chaos.
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:50.600]   - And gazes everywhere with these multiple heads.
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:51.800]   - Precisely, precisely.
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:53.400]   It's not integrated.
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:57.000]   Okay, now that's the disintegration of the patriarchy,
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:57.960]   you might say.
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:02.200]   Atop that is the Whore of Babylon.
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:07.200]   That's a beautiful woman who's subordinated her psyche
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:09.440]   to the demands of sexuality.
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:12.680]   She's the mother of all prostitutes, right?
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:15.620]   So she's extremely attractive, and she's clad in gold,
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:18.260]   and she holds a cup, it's very graphic imagery,
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:20.480]   that has nothing but the consequences
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:22.020]   of her fornication in it.
[01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:26.120]   - Is this like, I mean, I guess I will just say it.
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:27.600]   Recently there's been a number of posts
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:30.440]   on X of this woman who had sex with 100 men in a day.
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:33.200]   And now she's saying she's gonna have sex
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:34.240]   with 1,000 men in a day.
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:36.960]   - Yeah, well, she seems to be rethinking her plan,
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:39.200]   given the emotional consequences she had
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:40.480]   to her last success.
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:41.480]   - Yeah, I must say--
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.860]   - Her mother is her finance officer.
[01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:47.400]   - I'm speechless.
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:48.520]   - That's for sure.
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:49.360]   - I'm speechless.
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:54.360]   My response to her kind of post-100 men thing
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:57:00.280]   was it was hard for me to know to what extent
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:03.520]   that was part of the whatever--
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:04.360]   - The performance?
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:05.200]   Probably hard for everyone to do.
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:06.020]   - Whatever it was, you know?
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:08.200]   So it was hard for me to discern
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:09.480]   what was really going on there.
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:11.280]   I'm not a psychologist.
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:14.800]   But anyone who saw that would say,
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:17.800]   this is a pretty dark situation.
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:20.880]   - It's way darker than anybody who wanted
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:23.640]   to hold onto their sanity would possibly imagine.
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:26.400]   - What's also dark, and I'm not saying this
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:27.480]   from a place of moral judgment,
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:30.440]   I'm just saying this from a place of just kind of like,
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:34.920]   wow, like this woman obviously navigating life in this way,
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:36.640]   her choice, clearly.
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:40.780]   But the fact that so many people know about this,
[01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:42.700]   the fact that so many people,
[01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:43.820]   and here we're talking about it,
[01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:46.700]   but I think in service to a greater good,
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:51.700]   I certainly believe, that this is now out there, right?
[01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:53.980]   It's out there.
[01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:54.900]   Just like seeing somebody--
[01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:55.740]   - Pushing the envelope.
[01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:57.940]   - Just like seeing somebody murder somebody in cold blood.
[01:57:57.940 --> 01:58:00.020]   We could talk about that recently,
[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:02.780]   a video of an assassination.
[01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:04.320]   Those had been available before,
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:09.320]   but those two things kind of leveled up or leveled down,
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:13.960]   one's idea of what humans are capable of
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:15.640]   by allowing so many people--
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:16.720]   - And what's acceptable.
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:17.560]   - What's acceptable.
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:18.380]   - Or desirable.
[01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:19.760]   - That's right, the threshold shifted.
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:20.600]   - That's for sure.
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:21.720]   - Maybe that's what I'm looking for,
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:22.680]   the threshold shifted.
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:23.520]   - Yeah.
[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:24.340]   - Yeah.
[01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:25.660]   - Okay, so that's a great example,
[01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:29.860]   that young woman who's betrayed herself
[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:31.240]   in the deepest possible manner,
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:33.580]   and all of the people that are following her,
[01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:36.020]   and all the young women who are influenced by her.
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:41.020]   So you have this figure on the back of the degenerate state,
[01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:43.700]   that's the degenerate feminine.
[01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:48.020]   Female sexuality commoditizes
[01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:51.700]   when the masculine state degenerates.
[01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:54.060]   That's a sign of the end of things,
[01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:55.200]   and that makes perfect sense,
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:58.780]   because why wouldn't female sexuality commoditize
[01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:01.320]   when the masculine is no longer reliable?
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:03.080]   It's exactly what you'd expect.
[01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:04.520]   You know how the story ends?
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:07.960]   There's another element to it.
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:11.480]   The degenerate state offers the whore of Babylon
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:13.840]   as enticement for its degeneration.
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:16.720]   You can have everything you want on the sexual side.
[01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:19.000]   At the end of that substory,
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.400]   the state, the beast, kills the prostitute.
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:24.520]   And so what that means is that
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:28.820]   the long-term consequences of
[01:59:28.820 --> 01:59:31.940]   sacrifice-less sexual satiety
[01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:35.900]   is that sexuality itself is destroyed.
[01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:38.720]   And I think we're seeing that in our society now.
[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:43.480]   30% of Japanese under the age of 30 are virgins.
[01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:46.360]   Right, it's about the same in South Korea.
[01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:48.900]   Right, the birth rates in those countries have plummeted.
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:51.960]   Like, they're way, way below replacement.
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:56.960]   And increasingly, 50% of women in the West
[01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:59.240]   are childless at 30, 50%.
[01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:00.980]   - Yeah, birth rates are way, way down.
[02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:02.820]   - And going down as well.
[02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:04.540]   50% are childless.
[02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:07.580]   Half of them will never have a child,
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:09.180]   because 30 is already pushing it.
[02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:11.420]   And 95% of them will regret it.
[02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:13.140]   We're already in a situation in the West
[02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:17.020]   where one in four women will be involuntarily childless.
[02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:20.420]   Right, and so it's so, well, that's a good example,
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:23.580]   as I said earlier, of how these things are characterized
[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:27.700]   in this symbolic language that outlines the starkest,
[02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:31.180]   you might say, the starkest of biological realities.
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:33.060]   You said that there was a problem,
[02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:35.360]   you know, your sense was that there was a problem
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:37.860]   with effortless gratification.
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:39.100]   It's like, well, the problem,
[02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:41.100]   part of the problem with effortless gratification
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:43.420]   is it destroys itself.
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:46.160]   And it's so interesting, because the promise
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:48.020]   of the sexual revolution and the pill
[02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:52.660]   was an unlimited horizon of sexual opportunity.
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:57.140]   Okay, we know, but the actual consequence of that
[02:00:57.140 --> 02:01:00.680]   was, appears to be, that that's the pathway
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:02.700]   to the demise of sexuality itself.
[02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:04.420]   - This was if you can't be with the one you love,
[02:01:04.420 --> 02:01:05.660]   love the one you're with.
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:10.820]   Someone I know who was in their 20s in the 1970s
[02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:12.860]   explained to me, I always thought that song was about,
[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:15.940]   you know, if you can't be with the person that you love,
[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:17.500]   you know, you find someone else you can love.
[02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:19.380]   He explained to me that's not what that was about.
[02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:21.180]   That was about the wildness of the '70s.
[02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:22.780]   - Right, right, that promise.
[02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:24.960]   - Yeah, that was about the sort of the,
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:31.300]   just promiscuity had emerged as a theme of the 1970s.
[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:33.420]   - Yeah, well, I mean, in the aftermath
[02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:35.540]   of the birth control pill, it was not surprising
[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:38.140]   that people thought maybe that was possible.
[02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:40.460]   But that was wrong, it was seriously wrong.
[02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:42.820]   And we're going to be dealing with the consequences
[02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:44.180]   of that for a very long time.
[02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:46.540]   - You said that the patriarchy,
[02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:48.780]   the masculine fails before the--
[02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:52.900]   - Well, no, I would say that happens in concert, sure, sure.
[02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:54.580]   It's a feedback. - So it's not causal.
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:58.580]   - No, no, you can't, men and women degenerate
[02:01:58.580 --> 02:01:59.860]   at the same rate, right?
[02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:02.360]   I mean, we're involved in feedback processes
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:05.060]   that are so tight that there's no,
[02:02:05.060 --> 02:02:07.620]   like there's no oppressing women without oppressing men.
[02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:09.700]   There's no oppressing men without oppressing women.
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:12.660]   It's like we're joined at the hip, so to speak.
[02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:16.060]   And so, you know, these cultures
[02:02:16.060 --> 02:02:19.940]   that cloak women and silence them,
[02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:22.380]   you might think, well, that leads to the domination of men.
[02:02:22.380 --> 02:02:25.380]   It just turns men into pathological tyrants.
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:30.020]   Like there's no victory over one sex
[02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:32.700]   that's a victory of any sense at all.
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:34.380]   - It's anti-humanity.
[02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:36.300]   - Of course, of course, of course.
[02:02:36.300 --> 02:02:38.980]   - There was a recent post on X
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:43.300]   that just held my gaze, my attention,
[02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:45.460]   where it was a back and forth debate,
[02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:47.900]   a pseudo-political social debate.
[02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:49.740]   And then there were three words that,
[02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:54.500]   I'll just say that Mark Andreessen said,
[02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:58.980]   you know, it was about restoring vigor,
[02:02:58.980 --> 02:03:01.260]   pride, and achievement.
[02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:04.420]   And I thought, wow, like he's not a political candidate,
[02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:07.020]   but that's a beautiful trifecta,
[02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:10.420]   vigor, pride, and achievement to celebrate those.
[02:03:10.420 --> 02:03:12.780]   And I put that next to, you know,
[02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:16.620]   the deep pleasure in generative action at a distance,
[02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:18.740]   a technological development, the rockets.
[02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:21.700]   And there are other generative achievements.
[02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:22.540]   - I think that's exactly the theme
[02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:24.180]   of the story of Abraham.
[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:29.180]   It's like the highest form of potential satiation
[02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:34.500]   is risky romantic adventure.
[02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:37.100]   It's not satiation, right?
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:38.940]   That's the wrong frame, right?
[02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:40.860]   And so one of the things I've noticed,
[02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:43.740]   this is such fun, I've talked in front of,
[02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:45.500]   I don't know how many public audiences
[02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:48.300]   in the last eight years,
[02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:51.780]   independent of my professorial career,
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:54.420]   and those are large audiences.
[02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:57.260]   You know, they must average about 3,000 or 4,000 people.
[02:03:57.260 --> 02:04:01.140]   And there's one place I go
[02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:05.460]   that always reduces the audience to like dead silence.
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:10.460]   The audiences are usually quiet in the events.
[02:04:10.460 --> 02:04:13.060]   That's one of the ways, I'm sure you know this,
[02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:14.980]   is you wanna listen to the audience,
[02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:18.180]   you wanna stay in that zone where no one's moving, right?
[02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:20.860]   'Cause then you know their attention is focused,
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:24.100]   and you can hear that, and you can, I wouldn't say,
[02:04:24.100 --> 02:04:26.700]   you can play with it, not manipulatively,
[02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:28.300]   but in the proper sense of play.
[02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:33.340]   I learned a long while ago that adventure,
[02:04:33.340 --> 02:04:36.780]   let's say, is the highest form of reward.
[02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:38.980]   That's a good way of thinking about it.
[02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:41.020]   But there's a corollary to that
[02:04:41.020 --> 02:04:43.540]   that conservatives need to learn,
[02:04:43.540 --> 02:04:45.220]   'cause they don't know this.
[02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:47.260]   Conservatives talk about responsibility,
[02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:49.060]   but they're conscientious, and so for them,
[02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:53.580]   responsibility is dutiful, orderly productivity.
[02:04:53.580 --> 02:04:55.420]   It's conscientiousness.
[02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:57.980]   Responsibility is a conscientious duty.
[02:04:57.980 --> 02:05:00.420]   What they fail to understand is that there's no difference
[02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:02.560]   between responsibility and adventure.
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:05.080]   They're the same thing.
[02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:08.240]   And you can tell young men in particular that.
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:09.920]   Say, look, you wanna have an adventure,
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:11.400]   'cause you definitely want an adventure.
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:13.200]   You're like, you're built for that.
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:16.120]   It will increase your status, it will improve your life,
[02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:18.520]   like it'll improve the probability
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:19.600]   that you'll accomplish something.
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:20.800]   You want an adventure.
[02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:23.800]   Every fiber of your being is screaming for it.
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:24.840]   Where do you find it?
[02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:28.640]   You find it in the voluntary adoption of responsibility.
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:32.160]   And that's like, everyone needs to know that.
[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:34.000]   No young person has been taught that
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.080]   for like five generations.
[02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:37.920]   - This is important.
[02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:39.440]   Can we operationalize this?
[02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:41.240]   So in your first book, you talked about
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:42.960]   get your room in order.
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:45.580]   One of the first things I do when I wake up in the morning,
[02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:47.920]   I look around the kitchen, I look around my room,
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:49.680]   and I try and get things in order.
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:53.680]   Now I need that in order to be able to think clearly,
[02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:55.320]   but it's just a first order of business.
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:57.840]   - Well, it's also a great morning ritual,
[02:05:57.840 --> 02:05:58.920]   because it's often the case,
[02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:01.280]   especially if you have a bit of a depressive tilt,
[02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:03.840]   that it's kind of hard to get oriented properly
[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:05.600]   in the morning, you know?
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:09.680]   And if you take, like, I moved into a new house
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:12.600]   a while back in Northern Ontario,
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:14.720]   and the garage wasn't set up properly.
[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:16.640]   And the first thing I did in the morning was
[02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:18.800]   I went out in the garage for 10 minutes.
[02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:20.260]   And 10 minutes isn't very long,
[02:06:20.260 --> 02:06:22.560]   but I would like order one thing, you know,
[02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:24.840]   part of the toolbox or whatever.
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:26.640]   And like, if you do that every day,
[02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:28.140]   things fall into order pretty quickly.
[02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:30.200]   But it was a real relief to me in some way,
[02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:31.720]   because I didn't have to think about
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:33.480]   what I was gonna do when I woke up.
[02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:36.360]   I made my bed, and then I went and fixed the garage
[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:37.440]   for like 10 minutes.
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:38.880]   - And you get the brain into this,
[02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:41.220]   into what I call linear operations.
[02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:43.560]   Like the ability to carry out something linearly
[02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:45.880]   when there's a near infinite number of options
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:48.640]   in your phone, in your physical space,
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:52.480]   I think is so powerful, because you're picking a target.
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:53.320]   - Absolutely.
[02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:55.200]   - And it certainly isn't a sinful target.
[02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:57.200]   And you know it's not sin to clean your room
[02:06:57.200 --> 02:06:59.680]   or to organize your space or the garage.
[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:01.080]   So you start with it.
[02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:03.200]   So within the day, one can do that.
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:08.200]   In terms of, I really love the stickiness,
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:12.000]   the positive stickiness of this idea
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.480]   that adventure and responsibility are the same thing.
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:15.960]   - Well, let's take that apart,
[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:18.560]   because it's not immediately obvious.
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:21.280]   But look, when you go,
[02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:24.840]   let's say you go see an adventure movie, James Bond movie,
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:28.920]   you know, classic archetypal action adventure movie
[02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:30.640]   with some romance thrown in there.
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:33.760]   What is he doing?
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:35.400]   Well, difficult things.
[02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:36.440]   - He's trying to solve crimes.
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:37.520]   He's trying to catch bad guys.
[02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:40.480]   - Yeah, he's trying to battle with the forces of chaos
[02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:42.920]   that undermine the international order, right?
[02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:45.200]   I mean, it's high order adventure.
[02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:47.840]   And he's putting himself at substantive risk to do that.
[02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:50.160]   That's the sacrificial element to it.
[02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:52.080]   But everybody's gripped by it.
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:53.400]   Well, why?
[02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:55.840]   Because the stakes are high.
[02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:57.800]   What does it mean for the stakes to be high?
[02:07:57.800 --> 02:08:00.040]   It means the outcome matters.
[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:01.000]   What does that mean?
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.520]   It means it's a life and death situation.
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:06.280]   Like, none of that makes itself present
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:08.680]   without the hoisting of a burden.
[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:11.840]   And here's something else I figured out, so remarkable.
[02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:17.880]   So I went to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem,
[02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:22.000]   which is the first Christian church that was established.
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.880]   And hypothetically, it was established
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:27.840]   on the location of the crucifixion, right?
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:30.920]   And so at the center of the church is an altar,
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:32.560]   and at the center of the altar
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:34.880]   is the image of this crucifixion, right?
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:38.280]   Which is a sacrificial image, okay.
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:41.760]   Crucifixion, sacrificial image, altar, church.
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:44.560]   Then around the church is the community.
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:48.200]   And then that becomes the pattern for European towns, right?
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:50.720]   And all the towns that everyone wants to go visit in Europe
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:52.080]   have that pattern.
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:53.640]   Okay, so why?
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:57.320]   Well, responsible sacrifice is at the core of the community.
[02:08:57.320 --> 02:09:01.480]   That's what's dramatized in all that, in that architecture,
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:04.040]   in that sacred architecture,
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:09.040]   in the actual, in the structure of the community
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:10.600]   with its center.
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:13.760]   Well, of course, sacrifice is the center of the community.
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:17.080]   Obviously, because community is a sacrificial gesture.
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:20.040]   Like, insofar as you're not all about
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:22.680]   what you want right now,
[02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:25.160]   you're offering up a sacrifice of what it is
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:29.480]   that you want right now to the future and the community.
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:32.040]   Clearly, and now that's gonna integrate you psychologically,
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:34.680]   it's gonna integrate the society and make it productive.
[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:38.000]   And it's so interesting that we acted that out for,
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.800]   that proposition out for, well, the whole,
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:43.360]   at least insofar as you're talking about
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:46.640]   Christian-oriented civilization for the last 2,000 years,
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:48.440]   without ever really noticing that
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:50.840]   we were dramatizing the proposition
[02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:53.640]   that sacrifice is at the center of the community.
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:55.120]   It's like, well, obviously.
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:58.160]   - Well, what are we to make of cities like San Francisco,
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:09:59.560]   which I grew up just south of,
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:02.720]   and by any standard, it's a beautiful city.
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:04.080]   I know people are gonna roll their,
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:04.920]   some people will roll their eyes.
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:06.720]   I mean, you have the Bay on one side,
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:08.080]   you have the ocean on the other.
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:09.920]   It has magnificent bridges.
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:13.720]   I mean, it's a testament to what's possible in a city
[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:16.040]   in terms of diverse landscapes, et cetera.
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:18.380]   But the downtown, the center of the city,
[02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:23.380]   is just beyond anybody's sense of indecency
[02:10:23.380 --> 02:10:29.940]   to walk down in the afternoon hours, let alone at night.
[02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:32.980]   So that, at this point, you wonder,
[02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:35.260]   is the center really the center?
[02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:37.780]   I mean, you literally have to avoid the center of the city
[02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:40.220]   in order to get away from any of that.
[02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:42.580]   And it's very, it's sad. - Yeah, well, the question is.
[02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:43.900]   - It's tragic, it's tragic.
[02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:46.360]   - You're asking a symbolic question in some ways.
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:51.300]   Like, you're asking, what is the nature of the relationship
[02:10:51.300 --> 02:10:55.500]   between the state of society in general
[02:10:55.500 --> 02:10:59.780]   and the fact that the centers of cities have deteriorated?
[02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:02.500]   Well, those aren't unrelated, not in the least.
[02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:04.260]   They're very tightly related
[02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:07.060]   because the center does not hold, right?
[02:11:07.060 --> 02:11:09.940]   What's the famous poem from the 1920s?
[02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:11.400]   The center is loosened, right?
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:15.220]   And mere chaos is around, mere chaos is set upon the world.
[02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:17.400]   I haven't got the quote precisely right.
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:18.800]   That was T.S. Eliot.
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:22.720]   He knew that when the center pillar disintegrates,
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:24.280]   then everything falls into chaos.
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:28.260]   That's one of the oldest realizations of humankind.
[02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:29.600]   The question might be,
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:32.860]   what has caused the degeneration of the center?
[02:11:32.860 --> 02:11:35.720]   Well, man, you can think about that.
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:39.760]   The whole culture war is meditation
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:41.180]   on exactly that question.
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:44.800]   There's an insistence on the postmodern side.
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:47.860]   So the postmodernists, they figured out
[02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:51.180]   that we see the world through a story, and they were right.
[02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:52.900]   And that's a devastating blow
[02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:54.900]   to the empiricists and the rationalists
[02:11:54.900 --> 02:11:56.740]   'cause they were wrong.
[02:11:56.740 --> 02:11:58.460]   We do not build our knowledge
[02:11:58.460 --> 02:12:00.980]   in consequence of an aggregation of facts.
[02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:02.620]   That's not how it works.
[02:12:02.620 --> 02:12:05.900]   And a story is something like the prioritization
[02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:07.500]   of the world of facts.
[02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:11.180]   - I heard recently that religion teaches through story,
[02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:14.480]   philosophy teaches through language
[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:16.520]   that is divorced of story,
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:20.580]   and that science is designed to try and remove itself
[02:12:20.580 --> 02:12:22.640]   from language almost entirely.
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:24.520]   I mean, you'd love to just present graphs and figures,
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:26.160]   but you have to explain what's in those, right?
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:28.160]   There's a discussion, there's some conclusions,
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:30.120]   but the idea is that, as scientists,
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:31.600]   we're supposed to be objective
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:34.080]   and just interpret the data as they stand.
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:36.720]   - Yes, to only be informed by the facts.
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:38.040]   - To not infuse a story.
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:42.740]   - But story is the way that the brain works, right?
[02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:44.620]   I mean, beginning, middle, end.
[02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:46.060]   - It's also, the thing is,
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:50.220]   the story creeps into science in,
[02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:52.340]   what would you say, unavoidably.
[02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:55.180]   So here, let me give you an example.
[02:12:55.180 --> 02:13:00.100]   So I read a book once that was written by an ex-KGB agent
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:03.860]   who talked about a lab in the Soviet Union
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:06.660]   where there was a dreadful accident at one point
[02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:09.460]   that resulted in the death of about 500 people.
[02:13:09.460 --> 02:13:14.080]   They were trying to produce an amalgam of Ebola
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:17.420]   and smallpox.
[02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:18.260]   - Yikes.
[02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:19.660]   - And then to aerosolize it.
[02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:20.500]   - Oh, goodness.
[02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:24.440]   - Okay, now look, from a strictly scientific perspective,
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:28.400]   value-free, there's no difference
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:30.360]   between pursuing that branch of knowledge
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:32.500]   and pursuing any other.
[02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:34.080]   Now, you say, "Well, that's preposterous."
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:36.980]   It's like, yes, but it's preposterous
[02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:41.660]   because we know that you can have an evil scientist.
[02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:43.100]   I mean, Jesus, that's the trope of,
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:48.100]   how many movies uses evil scientist as a trope?
[02:13:48.100 --> 02:13:54.100]   Like, the bad guy is almost always an evil scientist, right?
[02:13:54.100 --> 02:13:56.460]   So it's not like we don't know this,
[02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:58.020]   so that science itself,
[02:13:58.020 --> 02:14:00.500]   which is the value-free pursuit of facts,
[02:14:00.500 --> 02:14:02.300]   can be an evil enterprise.
[02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:04.000]   If you're a good scientist,
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.160]   the story's always lurking in the background.
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:08.720]   Like, why are you conducting your investigation?
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:11.400]   Well, I wanna understand more about the human psyche.
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:12.240]   Well, why?
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:14.480]   Well, I wanna be of aid to the human enterprise.
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:15.560]   I wanna make things better.
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:17.000]   That's the story.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.280]   I wanna pursue truth in a manner that makes things better.
[02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:23.080]   That's the story part.
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:26.000]   And you might say, "Well, that's self-evidence."
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.600]   Like, it's only self-evident when it's working properly.
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:31.680]   When it's not working properly, things get bad quick.
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:34.460]   So there were scientists in Unit 731
[02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:36.420]   when the Japanese invaded China,
[02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:39.100]   and you cannot read about what they did
[02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:41.980]   without traumatizing yourself permanently
[02:14:41.980 --> 02:14:44.460]   for the rest of your life, right?
[02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:46.640]   What happened with Unit 731,
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:51.520]   it's the worst human atrocity I've ever seen by a lot,
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:54.980]   and that was the scientific enterprise gone astray,
[02:14:54.980 --> 02:14:56.200]   let's say.
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:59.440]   It has to be encapsulated within a value structure,
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:00.280]   and the question is,
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:02.760]   well, what's the appropriate value structure?
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:03.920]   We're starting to figure that out,
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:04.760]   'cause you know,
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:07.080]   I talked to Richard Dawkins about this a little bit.
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:09.000]   One of the things that disheartens Dawkins
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.980]   is that as the humanistic enterprise has progressed,
[02:15:12.980 --> 02:15:17.980]   and as the atheistic impulse has made itself more manifest,
[02:15:17.980 --> 02:15:20.760]   the assault on science and logic
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:23.040]   at the universities has intensified.
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:24.240]   'Cause his notion was,
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:25.440]   if we could just free ourself
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:27.520]   from the superstitions of the past,
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:29.840]   everyone would become like a hybrid
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:33.880]   between, let's say, Newton and Bacon and Descartes.
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:35.320]   It's like, no, it turns out
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:38.080]   that when you destabilize the underlying story,
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:41.880]   everybody becomes a narcissistic, immature psychopath,
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:44.080]   and they don't make good scientists.
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:46.720]   And the evidence for that is kind of stark,
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:49.240]   because I'm sure you've observed, like I've observed,
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:52.320]   that over the last 20 years,
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:53.920]   the scientific enterprise has become
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:55.920]   a lot less reliable than it was.
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:57.120]   - Well, for a number of reasons.
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:15:59.520]   I mean, one of the primary ones, in my opinion,
[02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:01.200]   and I'm familiar with the scientific community,
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:04.840]   is that a lot of science is built on lineages
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:07.040]   and who your advisors were and so forth.
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:08.400]   It relates to funding, et cetera.
[02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:11.760]   And it used to be that the primary value
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:16.040]   within and across lineages was to seek out new territory.
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:17.880]   I could tell a lot of stories that would take up hours
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:20.160]   about great advisors telling their students
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:21.480]   to move into new territories,
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:23.760]   which sounded like, get out of my field.
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:24.800]   I'm gonna demolish you.
[02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:26.680]   But instead, what they were encouraging them to do
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:28.440]   was to go on, let's use your language,
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:29.600]   new adventures of responsibility.
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:30.680]   - On a new frontier.
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:34.360]   - But instead, what's happened is that 95% of the scientists
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:37.880]   in a given subfield all work on similar problems,
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:39.920]   pin metals on each other, validate each other,
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:41.640]   fund each other, and as a consequence,
[02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:43.880]   there are a lot of untouched problems
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:47.320]   that will hopefully someday be investigated.
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:49.720]   The other consequence is that this debacle
[02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:51.800]   within the field of Alzheimer's and dementia,
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:53.800]   where one laboratory fudges data,
[02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:57.160]   and you kind of wonder if, I mean, that's not my subfield,
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:16:58.520]   but you step back from it and you go,
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:00.400]   how the hell did this progress for 15 years
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:04.080]   where everyone was, like the emperor has no clothes,
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:06.120]   like everyone agreeing that this is the stuff to work on
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:09.640]   when in fact the data were falsified and people knew.
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:10.760]   People knew.
[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:13.760]   So what that means is that it's like bad family values
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:15.040]   passed on through generations.
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:18.480]   And I do think these are well-meaning people along the line,
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:20.200]   but-- - Yeah, yes and no.
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:23.080]   They're a little bit intense
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:25.520]   on the career formulation side of things.
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:27.320]   - Well, so-- - Right, the careerist aspect
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:28.680]   as opposed to the scientist aspect.
[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:30.360]   - Well, we-- - Yeah, that exists too.
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:32.960]   - Well, let's think about that critically.
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:35.560]   It's like science is a very weird endeavor
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:39.480]   because in order to actually be a scientist,
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:42.800]   you have to put discovering that you're wrong
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:45.640]   before demonstrating that you're right.
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:48.320]   And that is hard on your career in the short term.
[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:51.600]   Like if you play that game and you're good at it,
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:53.400]   you can discover something real.
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:56.480]   But that's gonna take a while and it's not certain.
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:57.480]   - Right.
[02:17:57.480 --> 02:18:00.000]   - It's not at all surprising that people would subvert
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.600]   an enterprise that difficult
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:04.840]   to the narrow demands of career enhancement.
[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:06.560]   It's exactly what you'd expect
[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:11.160]   unless there was a stunningly powerful countervailing force.
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:13.320]   And that force was powerful enough, let's say,
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:18.320]   from 1550 to 1980 so that science worked.
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:23.480]   But that's a short period of time
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:25.320]   and it's only happened once.
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:28.040]   And we don't know what conditions had to be in place
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:32.360]   for people to actually like seriously prioritize the truth.
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:35.720]   Seriously, 'cause that's what a serious scientist does.
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:37.920]   And so it's not surprising that it would degenerate
[02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:40.320]   into something like dynasty and nepotism.
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:41.800]   That's exactly what you'd expect.
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:43.440]   That's the historical norm.
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:44.880]   So then you might think, well,
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:48.000]   what are the preconditions that have to be in place
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.600]   as narrative foundation for there to be at least
[02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:53.360]   some people that are prioritizing the truth?
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:56.440]   - I think one needs to reward true adventure and novelty,
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:18:58.360]   taking on novel problems.
[02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:01.520]   And these days, it's so hard for a scientist
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:02.920]   to birth an entire new field,
[02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:07.520]   and yet there are huge, huge sets of untapped problems.
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:10.120]   The challenge for them is it's difficult to get funding
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:11.840]   to take on things that are truly new.
[02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:13.240]   There's a lot of discussion these days
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:14.880]   about challenges with the NIH, et cetera.
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:16.560]   I think that the biggest challenge,
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:17.960]   regardless of the size of the budget,
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:20.440]   which is also an issue that needs to be dealt with,
[02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:21.680]   and where it's spent,
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:24.920]   is that we tend to reward science that's already completed,
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:26.760]   that fits with the current narrative,
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:28.120]   and it's very incremental.
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:29.800]   They reward incremental science.
[02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:32.440]   Whereas great science comes through taking great risk,
[02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:35.360]   and people, like you said, holding the truth above all else,
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:37.600]   and being willing to stake their careers on it.
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:40.680]   And we need to actually reward failure
[02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:43.320]   if it involved effort to solve things correctly.
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:46.120]   In other words, give young scientists funding
[02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:48.120]   and encourage them to go after novel problems,
[02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:50.560]   and understand that most of them will fail.
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:52.320]   And that doesn't necessarily mean
[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:54.680]   that they have to be exited out of the university,
[02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:57.160]   give them a new novel problem to tackle.
[02:19:57.160 --> 02:19:59.040]   Problem is there's so much pressure,
[02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:01.000]   and you know, because you're a university professor,
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:02.800]   I know in order to reach tenure,
[02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:06.240]   you need to reduce the entropy as much as possible.
[02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:09.560]   In any event, without going down that path too far,
[02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:11.320]   I now understand why you're saying
[02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:14.480]   that science has to invoke story.
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:15.520]   That makes sense. - It has to be embedded.
[02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:16.600]   - That makes sense, that makes sense.
[02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:20.920]   - Otherwise, well, science is the handmaiden of some story.
[02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:22.200]   There's no way around that,
[02:20:22.200 --> 02:20:25.120]   because motivation is the handmaiden of some story.
[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:27.520]   And so the motivational framework
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:30.000]   has to be put in place accurately,
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.320]   and the motivational framework
[02:20:31.320 --> 02:20:34.000]   for scientific inquiry is very stringent.
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.360]   Truth above all, right?
[02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:38.640]   So if you stake your whole goddamn career
[02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:41.640]   on a particular hypothesis, and you run a critical study,
[02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:46.080]   and it turns out that the reason you're famous is invalid,
[02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:47.880]   you have to publish that.
[02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:50.680]   Why the hell would you do that, right?
[02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:53.320]   And the answer has to be because you hold the truth
[02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:55.960]   in relationship to human flourishing
[02:20:55.960 --> 02:20:59.120]   higher than the integrity of your own,
[02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:01.800]   even your own self-valuation.
[02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:06.640]   Well, man, that's a very difficult thing to establish.
[02:21:06.640 --> 02:21:09.840]   Now, you can do that with young scientists to some degree,
[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:11.800]   because you can help them understand
[02:21:11.800 --> 02:21:16.200]   that as a medium to long-term game,
[02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:20.360]   there's nothing better than pursuit of the truth.
[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:22.640]   And so that's worth a risk.
[02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:26.160]   It's worth a risk because you can be spectacularly successful
[02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:27.320]   if you pursue the truth.
[02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:29.400]   It's unlikely, like it's unlikely
[02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:31.000]   to be a successful entrepreneur.
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.160]   But if you get it right, man,
[02:21:33.160 --> 02:21:35.840]   you've hit the mother load, right?
[02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:38.840]   And you don't want to falsify your data
[02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:41.040]   because you want to spend your whole life
[02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:42.880]   pursuing something that doesn't exist,
[02:21:42.880 --> 02:21:44.880]   'cause you will talk yourself into belief
[02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:46.840]   that your falsifications are true.
[02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:48.680]   And then you'll warp the whole field.
[02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:50.960]   As you said, you illustrated that
[02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:53.400]   in relationship to Alzheimer's disease.
[02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:58.280]   Like you can instill love of the truth in your students,
[02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:02.200]   but you have to believe, that's a story too,
[02:22:02.200 --> 02:22:05.560]   you have to believe that the truth will set you free, right?
[02:22:05.560 --> 02:22:09.160]   And that's a religious presumption in the final analysis.
[02:22:09.160 --> 02:22:13.360]   Serve truth, it's the best long-term strategy.
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:14.920]   It's the best adventure.
[02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:16.640]   That's a good thing to know too.
[02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:18.560]   It's the best adventure.
[02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:21.720]   So I made a triumvirate of truth,
[02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:23.360]   responsibility, and adventure,
[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:24.960]   saying they're the same thing.
[02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:27.840]   And I figured it out with regard to truth too.
[02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:32.680]   Truth is an adventure because if you,
[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:35.240]   what would you say?
[02:22:35.240 --> 02:22:37.480]   Vow to follow the path of the truth,
[02:22:37.480 --> 02:22:40.720]   you have to let go of the predictability of the outcome.
[02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:43.240]   Right, now if I wanted to manipulate you in some way,
[02:22:43.240 --> 02:22:48.160]   I would craft my strategy for this podcast a priori.
[02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:53.080]   And then I would tilt the podcast toward that end, right?
[02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:55.760]   And I could be more or less sophisticated than that.
[02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:57.400]   Or I could just say,
[02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:00.280]   we're gonna follow the thread wherever it goes,
[02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:02.440]   and I'm gonna accept the outcome.
[02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:04.160]   And I'm gonna presume that the outcome
[02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:07.080]   is the best outcome that could possibly have been,
[02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:10.160]   even if I don't see why.
[02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:12.560]   Okay, why is that an adventure?
[02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:15.040]   'Cause if I let go of my predetermined goal,
[02:23:15.040 --> 02:23:16.800]   I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:19.060]   And that's exciting.
[02:23:19.060 --> 02:23:21.280]   That's right, 'cause you don't know.
[02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:23.720]   Well, that's the essence of adventure.
[02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:27.200]   It's like you're bounding over the uncharted sea, let's say,
[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:29.520]   and you don't know what's gonna happen next.
[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:31.920]   Well, why would you exchange that
[02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:34.500]   for like a kind of banal predictability?
[02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:36.880]   Well, to build your career, just,
[02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:38.080]   I mean, I understand why,
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:40.080]   but you're foregoing what's truly valuable
[02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:41.320]   for something that's second rate,
[02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:42.580]   for something that's secure.
[02:23:42.580 --> 02:23:44.240]   That's what Abraham did.
[02:23:44.240 --> 02:23:47.320]   It's like, yeah, it's better to have the adventure.
[02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:48.960]   Why the hell wouldn't you want that?
[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:53.200]   - So he left what was indulgent, he had everything,
[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:55.480]   for what was truly generative,
[02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:57.320]   in service to something larger.
[02:23:57.320 --> 02:23:59.600]   - And dangerous, and dangerous.
[02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:01.360]   Like he ends up as a warrior.
[02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:03.240]   At one point, he has to raise an army
[02:24:03.240 --> 02:24:06.920]   to rescue his nephew from the hands of tyrants.
[02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:10.680]   It's like, all the adventures of life get thrown at him.
[02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:13.280]   But it turns out that that's what he wants.
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:16.720]   He wants all the adventures of life to be thrown at him.
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:18.040]   And that is what everyone wants.
[02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:21.160]   And I think that is, you know, the idea that
[02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:24.280]   when you go watch "The Lord of the Rings," for example,
[02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:28.000]   or "The Hobbit," you're seeing the characterization
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.200]   of human personality dramatized.
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:31.040]   Obviously, right?
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:32.540]   That's like a truism.
[02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:34.640]   But you have to think about what that means.
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:36.720]   It's like, "The Hobbit" is Abraham.
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:38.320]   It's exactly the same story.
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:41.760]   And that story's the story of the,
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:44.480]   that's the genuine identity of the individual.
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:46.680]   And the promise is, is that if you aim up
[02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:49.280]   and you live in the spirit of the truth,
[02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:51.680]   you'll have the redemptive adventure of your life.
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:54.240]   And that'll be of such significance
[02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:57.680]   that it'll justify the suffering that's intrinsic to life.
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:24:59.440]   And I think that's right.
[02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:02.040]   I mean, when you look at your own life,
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:05.180]   I mean, you're on an adventure.
[02:25:05.180 --> 02:25:06.300]   You have this podcast.
[02:25:06.300 --> 02:25:08.420]   It's ridiculously successful, right?
[02:25:08.420 --> 02:25:10.820]   In a way that I'm sure you couldn't have imagined.
[02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:12.180]   How long, five years ago?
[02:25:12.180 --> 02:25:14.460]   - Yeah, we are about to hit the end of four years
[02:25:14.460 --> 02:25:15.500]   in a couple of weeks.
[02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:17.300]   We launched in January, 2021.
[02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:21.020]   No premonition could have seen this.
[02:25:21.020 --> 02:25:23.500]   I had no concept that it would become what it's become.
[02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:24.340]   - Right, okay.
[02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:27.500]   And so what's the existential consequence of that?
[02:25:27.500 --> 02:25:30.940]   Like, you know, I mean, everyone's life is rife
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:32.440]   with the possibility of suffering,
[02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:36.360]   and now you have something exciting and generative to do.
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:37.700]   Why is that working?
[02:25:37.700 --> 02:25:40.300]   I mean, existentially, why does that work?
[02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:41.140]   - You know, people will ask me,
[02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:41.960]   "What's next?
[02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:42.800]   Where are you headed?"
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:44.520]   And I always just say, you know, like on,
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:46.440]   well, on Friday, I'm talking to Jordan Peterson,
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:48.020]   and I'm focused on that all week long.
[02:25:48.020 --> 02:25:50.620]   And next week I'm recording a solo podcast
[02:25:50.620 --> 02:25:52.320]   about whatever it happens to be.
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:56.220]   I just believe, that's setting my sights on the proximal.
[02:25:56.220 --> 02:26:01.220]   And I just believe in, I know my deep, deep, deep love
[02:26:01.220 --> 02:26:07.660]   of finding, organizing, and disseminating information
[02:26:07.660 --> 02:26:10.100]   that I hope will be useful to people.
[02:26:10.100 --> 02:26:10.940]   - Okay, so why- - And that's it.
[02:26:10.940 --> 02:26:13.160]   - Okay, okay, so- - That's the driving force
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:14.000]   behind all of it, really.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:14.860]   - Okay, so great.
[02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:17.880]   So I would say, I don't think that that proclamation,
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:21.300]   I don't think is any different from the notion
[02:26:21.300 --> 02:26:23.440]   of identity with the redeeming word.
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:25.260]   That's the same idea.
[02:26:25.260 --> 02:26:28.420]   'Cause you said generated, generating ideas, right?
[02:26:28.420 --> 02:26:31.060]   Information, and disseminating it, right?
[02:26:31.060 --> 02:26:33.420]   So that's like, it's valid inquiry
[02:26:33.420 --> 02:26:36.700]   and dissemination of the consequences.
[02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:37.900]   Okay, your claim is that
[02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:41.020]   that's highly intrinsically motivating.
[02:26:41.020 --> 02:26:41.860]   - Oh, yeah. - Right, okay.
[02:26:41.860 --> 02:26:43.820]   So then- - I delight in it.
[02:26:43.820 --> 02:26:44.980]   It's hard sometimes.
[02:26:44.980 --> 02:26:46.140]   I mean, I was trying to read
[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:47.580]   a really difficult paper yesterday.
[02:26:47.580 --> 02:26:50.260]   It's hard, but it feels so good.
[02:26:50.260 --> 02:26:51.620]   - Okay, so then we might say,
[02:26:51.620 --> 02:26:54.820]   well, what's the basis for that intrinsic pleasure?
[02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:56.700]   We think about that biologically.
[02:26:56.700 --> 02:27:00.580]   Well, you could imagine it as a manifestation
[02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:05.580]   of the instinct that integrates, right?
[02:27:05.580 --> 02:27:07.700]   It integrates you across time.
[02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:10.100]   It integrates you with other people across time, right?
[02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:11.640]   And there's a marker for that.
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:15.100]   Why wouldn't you find your, how could it be otherwise
[02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:19.100]   than you would find your deepest satisfaction
[02:27:19.100 --> 02:27:21.480]   in pursuing the course of action
[02:27:21.480 --> 02:27:23.660]   that integrates you psychologically
[02:27:23.660 --> 02:27:26.140]   and integrates other people socially?
[02:27:26.140 --> 02:27:28.540]   Like, that would assume that there's a concordance
[02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:30.340]   between your deepest self-interest
[02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:32.020]   and the interest of your society.
[02:27:32.020 --> 02:27:33.100]   And it better be that way,
[02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:35.720]   because otherwise you couldn't thrive
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:37.900]   as an individual in society.
[02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:39.140]   So it better be that way.
[02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:41.780]   And we've been doing this for a very long time
[02:27:41.780 --> 02:27:44.100]   as human beings, so why we wouldn't have an instinct
[02:27:44.100 --> 02:27:45.940]   to mark that pathway.
[02:27:45.940 --> 02:27:49.700]   And of course, we'd find our deepest satisfaction in that.
[02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:53.580]   I mean, once you see these issues
[02:27:53.580 --> 02:27:57.700]   through that light, they become, I think, painfully obvious.
[02:27:57.700 --> 02:28:01.780]   So, also because the contrary hypothesis is absurd.
[02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:03.420]   It's like you're gonna find deep satisfaction,
[02:28:03.420 --> 02:28:04.940]   what, rejecting knowledge.
[02:28:04.940 --> 02:28:07.700]   And if you do happen to stumble across a nugget,
[02:28:07.700 --> 02:28:10.660]   you're gonna hoard it for yourself.
[02:28:10.660 --> 02:28:12.180]   Right, well, right, right, exactly.
[02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:13.020]   It's laughable.
[02:28:13.020 --> 02:28:14.020]   It's clearly laughable.
[02:28:14.020 --> 02:28:15.860]   No one believes that.
[02:28:15.860 --> 02:28:18.260]   - Earlier, we were talking about operationalizing
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:24.060]   the effort, the calling to move from potential chaos
[02:28:24.060 --> 02:28:29.060]   to order starts with organizing one's physical space.
[02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:32.980]   If we were to extend the rings of the bullseye
[02:28:32.980 --> 02:28:35.700]   out a little bit further for people listening
[02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:36.940]   who are trying to figure out
[02:28:36.940 --> 02:28:39.620]   like where do they receive that calling?
[02:28:39.620 --> 02:28:42.740]   How do they find their calling?
[02:28:42.740 --> 02:28:46.620]   So responsibility and adventure being perhaps
[02:28:46.620 --> 02:28:50.940]   the compass through which we can navigate there.
[02:28:50.940 --> 02:28:55.300]   So they think like, well, where can they grab a hold
[02:28:55.300 --> 02:28:58.460]   of their responsibility and then as a consequence
[02:28:58.460 --> 02:29:02.100]   of doing that, engage in adventure and have an impact
[02:29:02.100 --> 02:29:04.420]   that is good for them and good for the world.
[02:29:04.420 --> 02:29:06.740]   How do they find that?
[02:29:06.740 --> 02:29:10.740]   - I think there's very practical answers to those questions.
[02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:15.420]   So two of the most, two of the highest order
[02:29:15.420 --> 02:29:18.460]   characterizations of the divine in the biblical library
[02:29:18.460 --> 02:29:22.060]   is calling and conscience.
[02:29:22.060 --> 02:29:23.660]   And you could think about those.
[02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:26.300]   You could think about those as integrated manifestations
[02:29:26.300 --> 02:29:28.780]   of positive and negative emotion.
[02:29:28.780 --> 02:29:33.780]   So imagine there's a pathway forward to your aim, okay?
[02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:35.740]   Your negative emotion tells you when you deviate
[02:29:35.740 --> 02:29:38.100]   from the pathway and your positive emotion tells you
[02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:39.940]   when you're progressing along the pathway.
[02:29:39.940 --> 02:29:41.860]   Okay, now imagine that there's a voice
[02:29:41.860 --> 02:29:44.460]   of your integrated positive emotion
[02:29:44.460 --> 02:29:47.260]   and there's a voice of your integrated negative emotion.
[02:29:47.260 --> 02:29:51.020]   Calling, that's what fills you with enthusiasm.
[02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:52.820]   And that root word of that is theos, right?
[02:29:52.820 --> 02:29:54.660]   Deos, that's God.
[02:29:54.660 --> 02:29:56.780]   Calling, conscience.
[02:29:56.780 --> 02:29:59.180]   Okay, so now that beckons you forward.
[02:29:59.180 --> 02:30:00.460]   So how do you find that?
[02:30:00.460 --> 02:30:02.100]   Some things bother you.
[02:30:02.100 --> 02:30:05.700]   Those are your problems.
[02:30:05.700 --> 02:30:07.300]   And you might think, I don't wanna have any problems.
[02:30:07.300 --> 02:30:10.420]   It's like, no, you've got some problems.
[02:30:10.420 --> 02:30:13.180]   You can tell that 'cause those things bug you.
[02:30:13.180 --> 02:30:16.140]   That's your conscience calling you to your destiny.
[02:30:16.140 --> 02:30:17.740]   Those problems, okay?
[02:30:17.740 --> 02:30:22.060]   Calling, there's some things that interest you, right?
[02:30:22.060 --> 02:30:23.780]   And you don't get to pick them exactly.
[02:30:23.780 --> 02:30:25.620]   They just sort of make themselves manifest
[02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:27.260]   like the burning bush did to Moses
[02:30:27.260 --> 02:30:28.860]   'cause that's an example.
[02:30:28.860 --> 02:30:32.220]   That's the symbolic representation of calling.
[02:30:32.220 --> 02:30:34.700]   It's the dynamism between calling and conscience
[02:30:34.700 --> 02:30:37.780]   that orients people upwards, right?
[02:30:37.780 --> 02:30:40.340]   That's the pillar of flame and the pillar of darkness
[02:30:40.340 --> 02:30:42.400]   that guides the Israelites across the desert
[02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:43.700]   when they're lost.
[02:30:43.700 --> 02:30:45.380]   Calling beckons.
[02:30:45.380 --> 02:30:48.020]   Conscience provides disciplinary limitations.
[02:30:48.020 --> 02:30:49.340]   That's a good way of thinking about it.
[02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:52.340]   So you can see that some things are good.
[02:30:52.340 --> 02:30:55.080]   You ask yourself, what bothers me about me?
[02:30:55.080 --> 02:30:57.860]   Okay, now you have a domain.
[02:30:57.860 --> 02:30:59.440]   You think, well, man, some of those things,
[02:30:59.440 --> 02:31:01.260]   I just, I don't know how to fix them.
[02:31:01.260 --> 02:31:04.340]   Fine, don't fix them.
[02:31:04.340 --> 02:31:06.060]   Fix some of the things you could fix.
[02:31:06.060 --> 02:31:07.620]   That's, we talked about that.
[02:31:07.620 --> 02:31:09.300]   Or make your goddamn bed in the morning.
[02:31:09.300 --> 02:31:10.780]   Like, you could do that.
[02:31:10.780 --> 02:31:13.520]   And it's like you see people, their lives are so chaotic.
[02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:16.100]   Like, their living environment,
[02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:19.740]   every single bit of it is a catastrophic mess.
[02:31:19.740 --> 02:31:22.800]   Sometimes multiple generations deep.
[02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:24.720]   It's just chaos everywhere.
[02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:27.240]   It's like, where do you start dealing with chaos?
[02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:28.760]   Wherever you can.
[02:31:28.760 --> 02:31:30.440]   Put something in order.
[02:31:30.440 --> 02:31:32.600]   By your own standards of order.
[02:31:32.600 --> 02:31:34.800]   And then see what happens 'cause what'll happen is
[02:31:34.800 --> 02:31:39.800]   now you got a little corner of order
[02:31:39.800 --> 02:31:41.800]   and now you're a little more well-situated
[02:31:41.800 --> 02:31:45.880]   and then you'll be able to see what's the next step.
[02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:47.460]   And you might think, well, it looks hopeless
[02:31:47.460 --> 02:31:48.800]   'cause there's just chaos everywhere.
[02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:53.360]   It's like, it's okay because the process is exponential.
[02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:58.360]   So even if you start nowhere, if you keep doubling,
[02:31:58.360 --> 02:32:01.480]   you're gonna get somewhere and faster than you think.
[02:32:01.480 --> 02:32:03.120]   And, well, the same thing applies
[02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:05.080]   when you're plummeting into the abyss, unfortunately.
[02:32:05.080 --> 02:32:06.680]   - The degenerative stuff.
[02:32:06.680 --> 02:32:09.320]   A colleague of mine who studies, he's a geneticist,
[02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:12.400]   said it takes many, many, many generations
[02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:13.460]   to evolve a species.
[02:32:13.460 --> 02:32:16.200]   It doesn't take very many to devolve a species.
[02:32:16.200 --> 02:32:18.080]   Negative mutations can build on another
[02:32:18.080 --> 02:32:20.340]   and crash a species very, very fast.
[02:32:20.340 --> 02:32:23.520]   I think our psyche is similar in that way.
[02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:25.160]   - Well, that's an entropic problem.
[02:32:25.160 --> 02:32:28.840]   There's way more ways to make something complex worse
[02:32:28.840 --> 02:32:30.520]   than there are to make it better.
[02:32:30.520 --> 02:32:31.360]   - Right.
[02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:34.080]   - That's why it's a straight and narrow path.
[02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:36.320]   - My father came to this country from Argentina
[02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:37.880]   and he grew up in a lot of,
[02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:39.600]   surrounded by a lot of political chaos,
[02:32:39.600 --> 02:32:41.040]   came to the country, became a physicist,
[02:32:41.040 --> 02:32:42.160]   probably 'cause he likes order.
[02:32:42.160 --> 02:32:43.600]   He's a very orderly guy.
[02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:48.200]   And it was probably in the early '90s that we went,
[02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:50.560]   I was born in '75, so probably, yeah, early '90s,
[02:32:50.560 --> 02:32:53.660]   that we went to a movie theater together to see a movie.
[02:32:53.660 --> 02:32:56.160]   And he said it as we were walking in.
[02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:57.560]   He said, "Look."
[02:32:57.560 --> 02:32:58.380]   And I said, "What?"
[02:32:58.380 --> 02:33:00.520]   And he said, "This is the beginning of the end."
[02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:01.480]   And I said, "What do you mean?"
[02:33:01.480 --> 02:33:04.480]   He said, "We're degenerating as a society."
[02:33:04.480 --> 02:33:05.320]   And I said, "Why?"
[02:33:05.320 --> 02:33:07.740]   And he said, "There are people here in their pajamas."
[02:33:07.740 --> 02:33:08.580]   - Right, right.
[02:33:08.580 --> 02:33:10.220]   - And obviously, they weren't in their pajamas,
[02:33:10.220 --> 02:33:14.040]   but they'd come in in kind of like bathroom slippers.
[02:33:14.040 --> 02:33:16.320]   And they weren't slovenly,
[02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:18.280]   but they weren't taking care of themselves.
[02:33:18.280 --> 02:33:19.520]   Clearly. - Worse, worse.
[02:33:19.520 --> 02:33:21.400]   - They didn't care what other people thought, right?
[02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:22.240]   They didn't care. - That's right.
[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:24.800]   They were making a public display of their lack of care.
[02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:25.640]   - Right, exactly. - Right, right.
[02:33:25.640 --> 02:33:27.840]   - Exactly. - That's a narcissistic aspect
[02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:28.680]   to that, too.
[02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:30.120]   Yeah, he's right about that.
[02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:31.080]   - Yeah, and I thought at the time,
[02:33:31.080 --> 02:33:32.000]   like he's being judgmental.
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:32.840]   I was a teen, right?
[02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:34.320]   He's being judgmental, et cetera.
[02:33:35.220 --> 02:33:39.660]   But, you know, I would say from 1990 until fairly recently,
[02:33:39.660 --> 02:33:41.460]   hopefully things are shifting for the better now,
[02:33:41.460 --> 02:33:44.260]   but there has seemed to be,
[02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:45.500]   it's kind of chaos out there.
[02:33:45.500 --> 02:33:46.420]   Now, I think it's wonderful
[02:33:46.420 --> 02:33:47.820]   that people can express themselves
[02:33:47.820 --> 02:33:51.540]   by wearing clothes that they feel represent them, et cetera.
[02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:52.700]   But this wasn't that.
[02:33:52.700 --> 02:33:54.300]   This was a lack of care.
[02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:57.500]   - Look, voluntary, what would you say?
[02:33:57.500 --> 02:34:00.940]   The evocation of voluntary chaos, that's one thing.
[02:34:00.940 --> 02:34:04.300]   The degeneration into chaos through sloth, let's say,
[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:06.120]   that's not an adventure.
[02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:08.380]   That's carelessness in all things
[02:34:08.380 --> 02:34:10.380]   masquerading as an adventure.
[02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:12.420]   I'm so cool, I don't care.
[02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:14.760]   It's like, you're not cool.
[02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:16.340]   You're just useless.
[02:34:16.340 --> 02:34:18.300]   And you're covering your uselessness
[02:34:18.300 --> 02:34:21.580]   with a veneer of revolutionary morality.
[02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:23.960]   It's like there's nothing in that that's up.
[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:25.500]   Like if people want to deviate
[02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:27.620]   in the manner they present themselves in dress,
[02:34:27.620 --> 02:34:28.560]   and they're doing that
[02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:32.460]   because they have a inspiration or a purpose,
[02:34:32.460 --> 02:34:34.400]   then that's completely different
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:37.540]   than just being so cool you don't care.
[02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:38.820]   And that's not cool.
[02:34:38.820 --> 02:34:41.140]   There's nothing about that that's cool.
[02:34:41.140 --> 02:34:43.340]   And you might say, and you had this sense
[02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:45.460]   when you were a kid that your dad was overreacting.
[02:34:45.460 --> 02:34:49.580]   It's like, yeah, well, if you look,
[02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:52.080]   you can see things before other people see them.
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:56.380]   And he came from a place that had gone through
[02:34:56.380 --> 02:34:58.820]   a fair number of very rough times.
[02:34:58.820 --> 02:35:01.860]   And so he could have been perfectly accurate
[02:35:01.860 --> 02:35:04.820]   in what he saw, highly likely.
[02:35:04.820 --> 02:35:09.280]   That's another example of the center disintegrating, right?
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:12.780]   - Where do you think we are now in the United States?
[02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:16.900]   I think in terms of how we hold
[02:35:16.900 --> 02:35:19.500]   and represent order versus chaos.
[02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:20.820]   I mean, we were talking about some of the,
[02:35:20.820 --> 02:35:23.220]   you know, these social media posts recently.
[02:35:23.220 --> 02:35:27.500]   We just had a public display of an assassination.
[02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:29.780]   - Maybe, you know, I hadn't intended on going there,
[02:35:29.780 --> 02:35:32.100]   but I think it's worth talking about.
[02:35:32.100 --> 02:35:32.940]   It was weird.
[02:35:32.940 --> 02:35:35.380]   I got pulled into this through tangential reasons.
[02:35:35.380 --> 02:35:39.780]   This Luigi Mancione's last tweet was a podcast cover
[02:35:39.780 --> 02:35:41.920]   of my episode with Jonathan Haidt.
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:45.780]   And some media outlets tried to make something of that.
[02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:50.060]   But clearly he was very smart.
[02:35:50.060 --> 02:35:53.700]   Clearly he had forethought to his actions.
[02:35:53.700 --> 02:35:56.060]   He 3D printed this gun, it seems.
[02:35:56.060 --> 02:35:57.740]   It is all alleged now, but it seems to be pointing
[02:35:57.740 --> 02:35:58.560]   in that direction.
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:35:59.600]   He seems to not want the police
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:01.320]   to go investigate anybody else, you know,
[02:36:01.320 --> 02:36:03.320]   because he claims there's no one else acting with him,
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:04.160]   et cetera.
[02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:07.380]   He clearly was trying to make a statement,
[02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:10.220]   but the statement was a combination of statements
[02:36:10.220 --> 02:36:15.220]   about the insurance system, sort of anti-establishment
[02:36:15.220 --> 02:36:19.300]   because of his affinity for Kaczynski Unabomber bombings.
[02:36:19.300 --> 02:36:22.980]   But at the same time, he didn't really seem to fall
[02:36:22.980 --> 02:36:25.700]   into kind of left-leaning or right-leaning politics squarely.
[02:36:25.700 --> 02:36:26.660]   He was kind of all over the place.
[02:36:26.660 --> 02:36:29.940]   So you're a trained clinician.
[02:36:29.940 --> 02:36:31.380]   Do you think there's some schizotypal
[02:36:31.380 --> 02:36:34.620]   or schizophrenic type organization there in his head
[02:36:34.620 --> 02:36:36.140]   or lack of organization?
[02:36:36.140 --> 02:36:37.740]   I mean, what are we to make of this?
[02:36:37.740 --> 02:36:42.740]   And we had to see somebody assassinated, shot in the back,
[02:36:42.740 --> 02:36:44.100]   multiple times. - If I had to hazard a guess,
[02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:46.580]   I would say the first thing I would be looking for
[02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:48.300]   is pathological narcissism.
[02:36:48.300 --> 02:36:54.140]   Disordered thought, possibly,
[02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:57.540]   but he was quite successful academically.
[02:36:57.540 --> 02:36:59.180]   Like the typical pattern for something
[02:36:59.180 --> 02:37:01.180]   like schizophrenic dissolution
[02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:04.640]   is very, very much difficulty in maintaining.
[02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:06.220]   So disciplined, striving
[02:37:06.220 --> 02:37:08.780]   in a highly intellectual atmosphere, for example.
[02:37:08.780 --> 02:37:09.620]   - Yeah, he was a valedictorian.
[02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:10.460]   He went to Ivy League school and graduated.
[02:37:10.460 --> 02:37:11.740]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I'd think
[02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:14.500]   more Luciferian grandiosity.
[02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:16.920]   And the intellect is particularly prone to that.
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:22.140]   The archetypal representation of the intellect
[02:37:22.140 --> 02:37:25.080]   that overreaches is Lucifer, right?
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:29.500]   God's highest angel gone most catastrophically wrong,
[02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:31.700]   which means that the best thing in its place
[02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:34.260]   is the worst thing on the top.
[02:37:34.260 --> 02:37:35.540]   That happens with sexuality.
[02:37:35.540 --> 02:37:37.020]   It can happen with aggression.
[02:37:37.020 --> 02:37:39.140]   It certainly happens with the intellect.
[02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:41.780]   And so I think he's a worshiper of his own intellect
[02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:45.580]   and believed that he was the guy who could make the decision
[02:37:45.580 --> 02:37:46.980]   even of life and death,
[02:37:46.980 --> 02:37:50.500]   which means he took onto himself the role of ultimate judge.
[02:37:50.500 --> 02:37:53.300]   And that's what the kid who shot up Columbine did too
[02:37:53.300 --> 02:37:55.100]   and said in his own writings.
[02:37:55.100 --> 02:37:56.660]   He's the judge.
[02:37:56.660 --> 02:38:00.060]   And that's like narcissistic beyond comprehension.
[02:38:00.060 --> 02:38:01.820]   And the fact that he's being celebrated,
[02:38:01.820 --> 02:38:05.780]   well, that's an echo of that moralizing narcissism
[02:38:05.780 --> 02:38:09.900]   that's deeply embedded in our culture, deeply embedded.
[02:38:09.900 --> 02:38:13.820]   And so, yeah, it's a very ugly, it's very ugly.
[02:38:13.820 --> 02:38:15.880]   I see, so we're going to what?
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:20.060]   We're now vigilantes in relationship to the corporate world,
[02:38:20.060 --> 02:38:21.940]   judge, jury, and executioner.
[02:38:21.940 --> 02:38:23.860]   And the reason we've taken on that role
[02:38:23.860 --> 02:38:27.100]   is because we, unlike, let's say,
[02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:29.260]   the people who run healthcare enterprises,
[02:38:29.260 --> 02:38:32.340]   we truly care for the sick and oppressed.
[02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:33.940]   It's like, do you now?
[02:38:33.940 --> 02:38:35.460]   Do you now?
[02:38:35.460 --> 02:38:37.380]   There's so much moralizing in our culture.
[02:38:37.380 --> 02:38:39.260]   It's beyond, it's really beyond belief.
[02:38:39.260 --> 02:38:40.340]   - I was going to say all these CEOs
[02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:41.740]   now are going to need personal security.
[02:38:41.740 --> 02:38:45.860]   That's hardly going to cause them to adjust their premiums
[02:38:45.860 --> 02:38:46.860]   or something downward.
[02:38:46.860 --> 02:38:48.820]   I mean, I think as people get more scared,
[02:38:48.820 --> 02:38:51.460]   they tend to show up. - Double down.
[02:38:51.460 --> 02:38:53.460]   - Yeah, they tend to double down.
[02:38:53.460 --> 02:38:56.340]   I mean, earlier we were talking about action at a distance.
[02:38:56.340 --> 02:39:01.340]   I mean, clearly this Mangione guy is aware of action.
[02:39:01.340 --> 02:39:03.940]   - Short-term route to high status.
[02:39:03.940 --> 02:39:08.940]   So ignored or notorious, there's a hard choice for young men.
[02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:11.940]   They'll pick notorious, many of them will.
[02:39:11.940 --> 02:39:16.700]   And no wonder, because status is everything.
[02:39:16.700 --> 02:39:18.700]   - And it's hard to do good things
[02:39:18.700 --> 02:39:20.180]   over long periods of time.
[02:39:20.180 --> 02:39:21.020]   - Right?
[02:39:21.020 --> 02:39:21.860]   - It's not hard to be good.
[02:39:21.860 --> 02:39:24.100]   It's just hard to do, it's hard to do good things.
[02:39:24.100 --> 02:39:25.180]   It's hard to do big things.
[02:39:25.180 --> 02:39:27.860]   I mean, I think that's one reason why I'm very happy
[02:39:27.860 --> 02:39:29.820]   that Elon is being celebrated.
[02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:32.340]   You don't have to agree with him politically,
[02:39:32.340 --> 02:39:35.420]   but the rockets going, the idea of going to Mars,
[02:39:35.420 --> 02:39:38.980]   trying to make sure that our species replaces itself.
[02:39:38.980 --> 02:39:41.900]   I mean, these are big, important endeavors.
[02:39:41.900 --> 02:39:42.740]   I mean, I, the reason-
[02:39:42.740 --> 02:39:44.500]   - Well, and he can clearly do them.
[02:39:44.500 --> 02:39:45.740]   I mean, he's- - Well, Neuralink, Neuralink.
[02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:48.020]   - He's been insanely successful
[02:39:48.020 --> 02:39:51.620]   doing five impossible things simultaneously.
[02:39:51.620 --> 02:39:53.340]   Right, that's not fluke.
[02:39:53.340 --> 02:39:54.180]   - No.
[02:39:54.180 --> 02:39:57.820]   - Right, once, probably not fluke even once,
[02:39:57.820 --> 02:40:01.700]   but the probability that it's fluke once is higher.
[02:40:01.700 --> 02:40:06.260]   Five times, no, that's a reputation.
[02:40:06.260 --> 02:40:10.560]   Right, and so, and he's a from first principle sort of guy.
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:13.180]   So yeah, I wouldn't bet against Elon Musk.
[02:40:13.180 --> 02:40:16.180]   So, and that is independent of his political stance.
[02:40:16.180 --> 02:40:21.080]   And is it difficult to do good things?
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:23.420]   - Well, it's hard, it's hard.
[02:40:23.420 --> 02:40:25.860]   It's hard to do long-term good things
[02:40:25.860 --> 02:40:26.860]   'cause they're long-term.
[02:40:26.860 --> 02:40:27.700]   That's what I was trying to say.
[02:40:27.700 --> 02:40:29.660]   - Right, but it's also intensely,
[02:40:29.660 --> 02:40:32.680]   the thing is it's also, this is that back to that issue
[02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:35.640]   of the relationship between responsibility and adventure.
[02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:40.640]   It's like, if the aim is true, the voyage is worthwhile.
[02:40:42.660 --> 02:40:44.780]   And so, and that happens right away.
[02:40:44.780 --> 02:40:47.980]   Like, you know, you're very successful with your podcast,
[02:40:47.980 --> 02:40:50.900]   but my suspicions are you've deeply enjoyed it
[02:40:50.900 --> 02:40:52.180]   since its onset.
[02:40:52.180 --> 02:40:56.140]   Well, so, well, that means that some of your pleasure
[02:40:56.140 --> 02:40:59.420]   is satiation related.
[02:40:59.420 --> 02:41:03.260]   You've become successful, but if that was your aim,
[02:41:03.260 --> 02:41:05.420]   you would have failed as a podcaster.
[02:41:05.420 --> 02:41:06.260]   Because a podcaster--
[02:41:06.260 --> 02:41:07.580]   - Definitely, I definitely would have failed.
[02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:08.420]   - Oh, definitely.
[02:41:08.420 --> 02:41:09.240]   - Right, right.
[02:41:09.240 --> 02:41:10.080]   - Oh, absolutely, 100%.
[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:12.020]   - 'Cause it wasn't the pursuit of pleasure per se.
[02:41:12.020 --> 02:41:13.740]   It's sort of like the difference between, you know,
[02:41:13.740 --> 02:41:18.060]   is it easier to be the class clown or the top of the class?
[02:41:18.060 --> 02:41:20.780]   It's just much easier to be the class clown.
[02:41:20.780 --> 02:41:23.300]   All you have to do is crack 10 jokes, one of them hits,
[02:41:23.300 --> 02:41:25.080]   you know, and you're safe,
[02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:27.360]   but you're actually dissolving as you go.
[02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:28.260]   - Right, right, right.
[02:41:28.260 --> 02:41:30.380]   Well, that's the prioritization of the short-term
[02:41:30.380 --> 02:41:31.220]   over the long run.
[02:41:31.220 --> 02:41:35.520]   I mean, Rogan's a perfectly appropriate example
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:36.980]   'cause he's sort of like the archetype
[02:41:36.980 --> 02:41:38.700]   of the successful podcaster.
[02:41:38.700 --> 02:41:41.220]   It's like, what's Joe doing?
[02:41:41.220 --> 02:41:42.500]   Well, he's doing what he's always done.
[02:41:42.500 --> 02:41:45.200]   He sits down with his producer, one guy,
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:47.780]   and he talks to people he wants to talk to
[02:41:47.780 --> 02:41:49.560]   about things he wants to talk to them about.
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:51.100]   That's the whole thing.
[02:41:51.100 --> 02:41:54.660]   The whole, and it's, you know, the lefties
[02:41:54.660 --> 02:41:58.180]   who refuse to talk to people in the podcast world
[02:41:58.180 --> 02:42:01.500]   for 10 years are now proclaiming to everyone who will listen
[02:42:01.500 --> 02:42:04.300]   that they should have built their own, you know,
[02:42:04.300 --> 02:42:06.460]   alternative media apparatus,
[02:42:06.460 --> 02:42:09.620]   and they could have participated in the one that exists now
[02:42:09.620 --> 02:42:13.860]   at any time had they shown the least proclivity to do so.
[02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:17.700]   It's not such an easy thing to build
[02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:21.000]   because it wasn't something that Joe built.
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.620]   It was something that happened around him
[02:42:23.620 --> 02:42:26.580]   in consequence of the nature of his pursuit,
[02:42:26.580 --> 02:42:27.420]   and that's the case
[02:42:27.420 --> 02:42:30.540]   for virtually all the successful podcasters.
[02:42:30.540 --> 02:42:33.540]   - I think people forget how Joe's podcast started.
[02:42:33.540 --> 02:42:34.500]   You might know this story.
[02:42:34.500 --> 02:42:35.380]   I'll keep it brief,
[02:42:35.380 --> 02:42:39.300]   but he was a comedian at the Comedy Store.
[02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:41.180]   He had done some television and things of that sort,
[02:42:41.180 --> 02:42:43.340]   but, and people can find this online.
[02:42:43.340 --> 02:42:44.380]   The videos are on YouTube,
[02:42:44.380 --> 02:42:48.300]   where a comedian was stealing Ari Shaffir's jokes.
[02:42:48.300 --> 02:42:50.900]   So Joe got up on stage and said,
[02:42:50.900 --> 02:42:55.900]   there's some ethics in the comedy community.
[02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:57.380]   People can buy jokes,
[02:42:57.380 --> 02:42:59.860]   but you don't steal jokes, apparently,
[02:42:59.860 --> 02:43:02.020]   and there's an etiquette as well.
[02:43:02.020 --> 02:43:03.780]   So apparently he confronted this guy
[02:43:03.780 --> 02:43:06.280]   in front of the audience and said,
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:08.280]   "You're stealing his jokes,"
[02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:10.380]   and the guy challenged him and Joe said, "No,"
[02:43:10.380 --> 02:43:12.420]   like Joe was stood up in the name of justice
[02:43:12.420 --> 02:43:13.780]   for a friend of his.
[02:43:13.780 --> 02:43:15.980]   And my understanding, could be wrong about this,
[02:43:15.980 --> 02:43:18.260]   but my understanding is that Joe was then banished
[02:43:18.260 --> 02:43:20.780]   from that particular comedy club.
[02:43:20.780 --> 02:43:21.940]   So what did he do?
[02:43:21.940 --> 02:43:24.060]   He went home, he popped open his laptop,
[02:43:24.060 --> 02:43:27.140]   and he and Brian Redman and a few other folks
[02:43:27.140 --> 02:43:30.100]   started what eventually became the Joe Rogan Podcast.
[02:43:30.100 --> 02:43:35.100]   It came out of an impulse to stand up for the truth,
[02:43:35.100 --> 02:43:37.900]   which I think is an important thing
[02:43:37.900 --> 02:43:39.480]   for people to understand,
[02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:41.520]   because it helps you understand Joe.
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:43.820]   - And he's been unerring in that.
[02:43:43.820 --> 02:43:46.060]   - Yeah, yeah, and I think that that's deep.
[02:43:46.060 --> 02:43:48.260]   Yeah, and he doesn't claim to always be right,
[02:43:48.260 --> 02:43:52.540]   but his pursuit of the truth
[02:43:52.540 --> 02:43:55.140]   has been a driving force for the podcast.
[02:43:55.140 --> 02:43:58.740]   - He claims consistently to not be sufficiently right.
[02:43:58.740 --> 02:44:01.660]   That's why he listens and asks questions.
[02:44:01.660 --> 02:44:03.900]   You don't ask genuine questions
[02:44:03.900 --> 02:44:07.260]   if you believe that you already know everything.
[02:44:07.260 --> 02:44:08.780]   You only ask real questions
[02:44:08.780 --> 02:44:11.060]   if you don't think that you know enough.
[02:44:11.060 --> 02:44:15.500]   And Joe wouldn't be perennially attractive to his audiences
[02:44:15.500 --> 02:44:17.420]   if he wasn't asking the same questions
[02:44:17.420 --> 02:44:19.820]   that the audience would like to have answered.
[02:44:19.820 --> 02:44:21.860]   - Right, he's genuinely curious.
[02:44:21.860 --> 02:44:22.700]   - Absolutely.
[02:44:22.700 --> 02:44:23.540]   - I mean, you said it.
[02:44:23.540 --> 02:44:26.400]   - Well, Musk himself said, when I interviewed him,
[02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:29.180]   he talked about a terrible existential crisis
[02:44:29.180 --> 02:44:32.140]   that he had when he was 13, 14,
[02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:36.980]   which is not atypical of people with outstanding intellects,
[02:44:36.980 --> 02:44:37.820]   let's say.
[02:44:37.820 --> 02:44:43.020]   And he resolved that by recognizing
[02:44:43.020 --> 02:44:47.460]   that the quest is the source of meaning.
[02:44:47.460 --> 02:44:49.260]   And so he took it upon himself
[02:44:49.260 --> 02:44:53.380]   to confront difficult problems and try to solve them.
[02:44:53.380 --> 02:44:55.780]   And he found that to be sufficiently gratifying,
[02:44:55.780 --> 02:44:58.940]   so his existential crisis resolved itself.
[02:44:58.940 --> 02:45:02.040]   And that's very much the same pattern
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:06.500]   that Rogan is exemplifying in you, in your pursuits.
[02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:10.660]   And you can see what impact it has on the public, you know?
[02:45:10.660 --> 02:45:13.760]   And I was talking with one of your staff members
[02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:18.140]   before this podcast about your lectures, say, in Australia.
[02:45:18.140 --> 02:45:19.580]   And so you're in the weird position
[02:45:19.580 --> 02:45:22.340]   where 5,000 people come and listen
[02:45:22.340 --> 02:45:26.660]   to a biologist lecture spontaneously for, what, 90 minutes?
[02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:28.060]   Like, what the hell?
[02:45:28.060 --> 02:45:31.120]   Well, that's just an indication of how compelled people are
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:34.460]   by anything approximating a genuine quest.
[02:45:34.460 --> 02:45:37.180]   It doesn't even matter the direction, right?
[02:45:37.180 --> 02:45:38.460]   It matters the commitment
[02:45:38.460 --> 02:45:42.740]   and that capacity to explore and transmit.
[02:45:42.740 --> 02:45:45.700]   And that is a manifestation of the word that redeems.
[02:45:45.700 --> 02:45:49.120]   - I love this idea, or what you just said,
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:52.260]   that it doesn't even so much matter the direction
[02:45:52.260 --> 02:45:53.780]   as much as the commitment.
[02:45:53.780 --> 02:45:55.300]   A colleague of mine at Stanford
[02:45:55.300 --> 02:45:58.020]   who I respect tremendously, Anna Lembke,
[02:45:58.020 --> 02:45:59.660]   who wrote the book "Dopamine Nation,"
[02:45:59.660 --> 02:46:01.920]   she's the head of our Dual Diagnosis Addiction Center.
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:04.600]   She was the one who really truly deserves credit
[02:46:04.600 --> 02:46:06.940]   for bringing dopamine into the public discussion
[02:46:06.940 --> 02:46:07.780]   over the last few years.
[02:46:07.780 --> 02:46:10.960]   She initiated that, talking about how big inflections
[02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:12.280]   in dopamine that are very fast,
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:14.040]   that aren't preceded by effort,
[02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:16.600]   aka drugs of abuse, behavioral addictions, et cetera,
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:18.920]   leave us below baseline with our dopamine.
[02:46:18.920 --> 02:46:20.920]   And then people will engage in more of the behavior
[02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:22.320]   that drives us further and further and further.
[02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:24.020]   That's kind of the principle of it.
[02:46:24.020 --> 02:46:28.000]   I was talking to her about how people get sober
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.760]   and the conversation turned to
[02:46:30.760 --> 02:46:33.280]   how do young people find their purpose.
[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:34.680]   It was very interesting.
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:36.520]   She said, "Let's talk about finding purpose.
[02:46:36.520 --> 02:46:39.800]   "Everyone nowadays wants to know what their purpose is."
[02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:41.520]   And she said, "The way you find your purpose
[02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:43.140]   "is by going out onto your front lawn
[02:46:43.140 --> 02:46:45.300]   "and seeing if the leaves need to be raked."
[02:46:45.300 --> 02:46:46.560]   Sounds familiar, right?
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:51.420]   You find purpose by figuring out how you can be of use
[02:46:51.420 --> 02:46:53.640]   at progressively larger and larger spheres
[02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:55.600]   away from yourself.
[02:46:55.600 --> 02:46:57.060]   And in doing that- - And the present.
[02:46:57.060 --> 02:46:59.120]   - And in doing that, you start to hear the calling
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:00.560]   and you find your purpose.
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:03.540]   And as you said, you don't- - Or it reveals itself to you.
[02:47:03.540 --> 02:47:04.920]   - It reveals, yeah. - And this is the same thing.
[02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:05.760]   - Right. - Yeah, yeah.
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:07.840]   - So I think you two would enjoy a conversation
[02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:08.680]   at some point. - Well, well, yeah.
[02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:09.960]   - I think you're very aligned. - This is an important thing
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:13.000]   to return to because people are often curious
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:14.320]   about what to do practically.
[02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:18.140]   It's like, okay, first, this is what Jacob does.
[02:47:18.140 --> 02:47:20.040]   Jacob, in the Old Testament stories,
[02:47:20.040 --> 02:47:22.080]   he eventually becomes Israel, right?
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:23.680]   And so that's his name.
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:26.680]   And Israel means we who wrestle with God.
[02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:29.920]   Now, Jacob is a bad guy when the story starts.
[02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:32.920]   And he leaves his home and the perverse influence
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:37.920]   of his mother and his criminal betraying past behind.
[02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:41.540]   And he decides that he's going to aim up.
[02:47:41.540 --> 02:47:45.280]   And that night, he makes an altar and he makes a sacrifice.
[02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:47.240]   And that night, he has a dream of a staircase
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:48.600]   that reaches up to heaven,
[02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:51.320]   which is now what he's walking up, right?
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:55.720]   And so he finds his purpose.
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:01.120]   He finds his adventure as a consequence
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:03.480]   of his decision to be better.
[02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:05.240]   Okay, so now you wanna find your purpose.
[02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:07.920]   Okay, first thing you have to do,
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:13.040]   you have to review how wretched and miserable
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:14.880]   you actually are.
[02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:16.520]   And you have to face that.
[02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:19.600]   And then you have to think, I'd rather not have that.
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:21.320]   And it has to be true.
[02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:23.080]   And then you have to aim up.
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:24.520]   Now, you don't know what that means
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:27.440]   because you're pretty scattered and dissolute,
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:30.640]   but at least you got the damn intent in mind.
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:34.080]   And then you have to be willing to make the sacrifices,
[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:35.400]   right, along the way.
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:37.120]   Okay, then what happens?
[02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:40.320]   Well, then the pathway will reveal itself to you
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:42.600]   in increments, calling.
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:44.740]   Is there something around here that I could fix,
[02:48:44.740 --> 02:48:46.720]   that I would fix?
[02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:47.920]   That's a great question.
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:51.160]   Is there something at hand that I could fix,
[02:48:51.160 --> 02:48:52.480]   that I would fix?
[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:53.600]   It might be something low,
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:55.640]   'cause especially when you first get going,
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:48:57.160]   you're not good for anything.
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:48:59.240]   So you might have to start with something pretty trivial,
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:02.120]   but it doesn't matter 'cause you start getting better.
[02:49:02.120 --> 02:49:04.600]   Is there something that bothers me, that's conscience,
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:07.160]   that I could set right in some small way?
[02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:09.640]   Well, that's there for everyone, right?
[02:49:09.640 --> 02:49:13.320]   In the midst of the most catastrophic mess, that pathway,
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:15.920]   you might even say, look, the more mess around you,
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:19.360]   the more unstructured possibility you have at hand.
[02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:21.000]   And it's true, you know, it's like,
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:24.440]   I'm not trying to be a Pollyanna about this.
[02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:26.720]   I know how difficult that is,
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:29.680]   but it is the case that the more mess at hand
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:32.780]   that you can see, the more opportunity that's there,
[02:49:32.780 --> 02:49:35.800]   'cause, well, if you can see that it's a mess,
[02:49:35.800 --> 02:49:40.960]   then you can see the pathway to cleaning it up.
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:44.240]   Well, so do it, do it, see what happens.
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:45.680]   That's the adventure.
[02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:47.240]   What's gonna happen?
[02:49:47.240 --> 02:49:50.560]   In my class, my Maps of Meaning class,
[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:53.280]   I used to have students do this as a project.
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:56.600]   And one of the projects was find something around you
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:49:58.760]   in your neighborhood, wherever, in your family
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:02.160]   that isn't set right and see if you could set it right.
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:03.960]   Just write down what happens.
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:06.480]   Well, one student in particular,
[02:50:06.480 --> 02:50:07.960]   he decided his mother had died
[02:50:07.960 --> 02:50:10.080]   and the family kind of fragmented.
[02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:13.560]   And so he decided he would try to take on the role of mother,
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:18.000]   you know, be responsible for the household operating.
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.840]   Well, it grew him up like mad, as you can imagine.
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:23.800]   He ran into all sorts of weird resistances, right?
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:25.360]   'Cause his family was upset
[02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:27.240]   that he was doing what mom used to do.
[02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:31.040]   And like, he just had a tremendously complex adventure
[02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:34.560]   as a consequence of his willingness to pursue this.
[02:50:34.560 --> 02:50:37.000]   It was obviously necessary 'cause the alternative
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.200]   was that his family was gonna fall apart.
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:40.920]   It's like, that's there for everyone.
[02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:43.280]   You say, well, my circumstances are so difficult.
[02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:44.560]   It's like, fair enough.
[02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:47.120]   So are everybody else's, by the way.
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:51.400]   But that means there's a lot of mess, fix it a bit.
[02:50:51.400 --> 02:50:56.040]   And that's ridiculously entertaining and unpredictable.
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:50:58.080]   And that in itself is a great deal.
[02:50:58.080 --> 02:50:59.540]   You have no idea what's gonna happen.
[02:50:59.540 --> 02:51:00.800]   Just like you didn't know what happened
[02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:02.080]   when you started the podcast.
[02:51:02.080 --> 02:51:03.940]   Why'd you start it?
[02:51:03.940 --> 02:51:08.840]   - I had a, for me, I felt a compulsion to share what I knew,
[02:51:08.840 --> 02:51:11.840]   but because during the pandemic,
[02:51:11.840 --> 02:51:16.180]   everyone was so focused on vaccines and lockdowns
[02:51:16.180 --> 02:51:18.040]   that no one was talking about the reality
[02:51:18.040 --> 02:51:20.480]   that everyone was facing, including,
[02:51:20.480 --> 02:51:23.220]   sorry, Josh Gordon, I know him through time,
[02:51:23.220 --> 02:51:27.240]   our director of the National Institutes of Mental Health.
[02:51:27.240 --> 02:51:29.680]   Not a single thing out there about,
[02:51:29.680 --> 02:51:31.920]   hey folks, if you're gonna be indoors this much,
[02:51:31.920 --> 02:51:33.400]   get some sunlight in your eyes in the morning,
[02:51:33.400 --> 02:51:34.680]   or else you're gonna have trouble sleeping.
[02:51:34.680 --> 02:51:36.860]   Trouble sleeping equates to mental health issues.
[02:51:36.860 --> 02:51:38.520]   Stress, uncertainty.
[02:51:38.520 --> 02:51:41.480]   My lab was working on ways to regulate stress
[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:44.440]   through deliberate breathing, through other mechanisms.
[02:51:44.440 --> 02:51:46.500]   It was like, well, I want people to have tools,
[02:51:46.500 --> 02:51:49.040]   zero cost tools to deal with their stress,
[02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:51.180]   to help them regulate their circadian biology,
[02:51:51.180 --> 02:51:56.020]   because those wick out to countering the negative forces
[02:51:56.020 --> 02:51:58.900]   that were on us, which are social order was disrupted,
[02:51:58.900 --> 02:51:59.740]   people are at home.
[02:51:59.740 --> 02:52:01.540]   So it was the desire to give people tools
[02:52:01.540 --> 02:52:04.580]   that I knew existed, that I was knowledgeable about.
[02:52:04.580 --> 02:52:08.820]   And I had a longstanding kind of growing compulsion
[02:52:08.820 --> 02:52:10.660]   that I wanted to talk about neuroscience
[02:52:10.660 --> 02:52:12.420]   because it's so darn cool.
[02:52:12.420 --> 02:52:13.700]   - Right, okay, so it's a logical extension.
[02:52:13.700 --> 02:52:16.600]   - There was a lot of energy behind the mission,
[02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:17.760]   but then there was a calling.
[02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:19.760]   The calling was from hearing about people's suffering.
[02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:21.560]   It's like, well, of course you're not sleeping well.
[02:52:21.560 --> 02:52:22.980]   I mean, not only are there a million things
[02:52:22.980 --> 02:52:25.600]   to worry about right now, people aren't working, et cetera,
[02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:27.880]   but you're not getting sunlight in your eyes.
[02:52:27.880 --> 02:52:28.920]   You need to get outside.
[02:52:28.920 --> 02:52:29.920]   You need to, you know,
[02:52:29.920 --> 02:52:31.660]   and then there's the whole socialization thing,
[02:52:31.660 --> 02:52:33.520]   and whatever people's circumstances,
[02:52:33.520 --> 02:52:35.080]   there are things that they could do.
[02:52:35.080 --> 02:52:36.480]   And so I felt that calling,
[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:39.680]   and my conscience told me that I have the knowledge,
[02:52:39.680 --> 02:52:43.000]   so why would I cloister with it at home?
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:44.460]   That's like, what good is that?
[02:52:44.460 --> 02:52:46.920]   And so I just started blabbing on the internet.
[02:52:46.920 --> 02:52:48.240]   - Right, right.
[02:52:48.240 --> 02:52:49.080]   - That's why.
[02:52:49.080 --> 02:52:51.400]   - Yeah, well, that's a perfectly, you know,
[02:52:51.400 --> 02:52:53.760]   you can think, well, that's a logical extension
[02:52:53.760 --> 02:52:57.880]   of your subsidiary calling to be a teacher and a professor.
[02:52:57.880 --> 02:53:00.100]   You're already a researcher, you're already a professor,
[02:53:00.100 --> 02:53:02.560]   so you're investigating and transmitting knowledge.
[02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:04.880]   It's like, well, looks like you could do that
[02:53:04.880 --> 02:53:07.800]   on a broader scale, and the technology's there.
[02:53:07.800 --> 02:53:09.640]   Why not explore that?
[02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:11.040]   That's a perfectly reasonable,
[02:53:11.040 --> 02:53:12.160]   and you can see the interplay
[02:53:12.160 --> 02:53:13.940]   of calling and conscience there.
[02:53:13.940 --> 02:53:15.960]   That's a lovely way of characterizing
[02:53:15.960 --> 02:53:17.280]   the voice of the divine,
[02:53:17.280 --> 02:53:19.600]   which is how it's characterized, repeated.
[02:53:19.600 --> 02:53:24.240]   Elijah, Elijah's the prophet who appears with Christ
[02:53:24.240 --> 02:53:27.120]   when he's transfigured on the mount in the New Testament.
[02:53:27.120 --> 02:53:28.440]   It's Elijah and Moses.
[02:53:28.440 --> 02:53:30.720]   Elijah is the first person in human history
[02:53:30.720 --> 02:53:33.100]   who identifies the divine with conscience.
[02:53:33.100 --> 02:53:34.440]   That's his contribution.
[02:53:34.440 --> 02:53:37.920]   That's a major psychological revolution, right?
[02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:42.920]   It's an unheralded transformation in understanding.
[02:53:42.920 --> 02:53:46.280]   It's like, it's not the storm, it's not the forest fire,
[02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:49.600]   it's not the earthquake, it's not the god of nature.
[02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:53.520]   He's the originator of the phrase, the still, small voice.
[02:53:53.520 --> 02:53:55.200]   Right, it's like that's a,
[02:53:55.200 --> 02:53:57.080]   that the notion that your conscience
[02:53:57.080 --> 02:53:58.560]   is the voice of the divine,
[02:53:58.560 --> 02:54:03.400]   my God, there's virtually no discovery.
[02:54:03.400 --> 02:54:06.680]   There's no proposition more revolutionary than that.
[02:54:06.680 --> 02:54:10.760]   And so that's why Elijah is a prophet of primary status.
[02:54:10.760 --> 02:54:12.680]   And I just see no reason at all
[02:54:12.680 --> 02:54:14.240]   not to take that claim seriously.
[02:54:14.240 --> 02:54:16.760]   It's like, you come up with an explanation
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:18.360]   for your conscience.
[02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:21.100]   It tells you things you don't want to hear.
[02:54:21.100 --> 02:54:23.280]   So how is that you?
[02:54:23.280 --> 02:54:26.940]   I mean, you have to gerrymander the definition of you
[02:54:26.940 --> 02:54:28.960]   for that to be you.
[02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:30.160]   - No, I absolutely believe
[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:32.580]   that things come from outside of us, certainly for me.
[02:54:32.580 --> 02:54:36.520]   And I'm now very much a devotee of prayer.
[02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:38.480]   I pray before this podcast.
[02:54:38.480 --> 02:54:39.400]   - What do you pray?
[02:54:39.400 --> 02:54:40.760]   - Well, before this podcast,
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:43.300]   I prayed for clarity of mind,
[02:54:43.300 --> 02:54:46.180]   to be able to learn from you
[02:54:46.180 --> 02:54:48.860]   and to help transmit that knowledge out to people
[02:54:48.860 --> 02:54:50.760]   in a way that would be useful to them,
[02:54:50.760 --> 02:54:53.680]   for sustained focus,
[02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:58.200]   for the ability to also let go
[02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:01.360]   and not try and control or lead with questions.
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:02.600]   - That sacrifice, yeah, yeah.
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:07.600]   - And to allow a sense of randomness and serendipity
[02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:12.440]   to make it what it is,
[02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:15.520]   trusting that it's in service to the listeners.
[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:18.480]   - Right, well, that's a very precise
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:20.520]   and properly formulated prayer.
[02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:21.960]   - Yeah, I pray before every podcast.
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:23.160]   I pray before going to sleep each night.
[02:55:23.160 --> 02:55:26.660]   I've been doing this for a little over a year.
[02:55:26.660 --> 02:55:28.360]   I always quietly, secretly.
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:29.840]   - Why did you decide to do that?
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:32.480]   - My coming to the whole notion of prayer and God,
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:36.800]   et cetera, was complicated in the backdrop
[02:55:36.800 --> 02:55:39.140]   in the sense that I always secretly prayed,
[02:55:39.140 --> 02:55:41.840]   always secretly prayed.
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:45.920]   And then about a year, about a year and a half ago,
[02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:47.720]   a guy that works on my security team
[02:55:47.720 --> 02:55:50.640]   started talking to me about the Bible.
[02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:54.760]   We started talking about God and it made sense.
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:56.480]   I started reading the Bible.
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:55:59.800]   I'm not through it yet and I started praying.
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:02.080]   And I had a number of experiences
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:03.520]   as a consequence of praying,
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:05.600]   clearly as a consequence of prayer
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:09.900]   that made me realize that prayer
[02:56:09.900 --> 02:56:12.480]   doesn't give me a capacity of any sort.
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:14.120]   It just allows certain things
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:17.640]   that I believe are inside of me to come out.
[02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:18.480]   And for-
[02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:20.580]   - Yeah, proper prayer establishes aim.
[02:56:20.580 --> 02:56:21.580]   - Yeah, that's right.
[02:56:21.580 --> 02:56:22.420]   - Oh yeah. - That's right.
[02:56:22.420 --> 02:56:23.920]   - Well, why wouldn't you establish your aim?
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:25.680]   Like, why wouldn't you take a moment
[02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:27.920]   before you start your podcast
[02:56:27.920 --> 02:56:30.640]   to remember what the hell you're trying to accomplish
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:32.200]   and to have it firmly in mind?
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:33.960]   - Yeah, and it felt different.
[02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:35.840]   So I should say that I have this little list
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:36.660]   that I sometimes do.
[02:56:36.660 --> 02:56:38.120]   I'll say, you know,
[02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:39.700]   deliberate breathing, aka breath work,
[02:56:39.700 --> 02:56:41.280]   can allow you to shift your state.
[02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:43.800]   Hypnosis is a tool that can allow you
[02:56:43.800 --> 02:56:45.440]   to solve a particular problem
[02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:49.120]   'cause it has some aspect of neuroplasticity in there.
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:50.680]   Non-sleep-depressed, which is a thing
[02:56:50.680 --> 02:56:54.320]   that was built out of this practice called yoga nidra,
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:56.880]   where you go into an awake but deeply relaxed state,
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:56:58.440]   allows you to restore your vigor.
[02:56:58.440 --> 02:56:59.440]   Meditation, to me,
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:02.600]   is a way of enhancing one's ability to focus.
[02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:04.080]   You know, third eye meditation
[02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:05.320]   of concentrating your breath, et cetera.
[02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:07.480]   I mean, we know based on the data, it improves focus.
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:10.700]   Prayer, to me, is entirely different than all of those.
[02:57:10.700 --> 02:57:12.080]   There's some overlap.
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:14.200]   They look similar.
[02:57:14.200 --> 02:57:16.200]   Some of them look similar from the outside.
[02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:19.520]   But prayer, for me,
[02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:23.260]   is the allowing of something from truly outside me
[02:57:23.260 --> 02:57:27.140]   to come through me and bring out the best in me.
[02:57:27.140 --> 02:57:29.820]   And that's why I pray for four things.
[02:57:29.820 --> 02:57:31.220]   I pray for ability.
[02:57:31.220 --> 02:57:32.860]   I pray for other people.
[02:57:32.860 --> 02:57:34.440]   And I also have learned
[02:57:34.440 --> 02:57:37.580]   that a powerful aspect of prayer is just listening.
[02:57:37.580 --> 02:57:40.040]   Because just stopping and listening
[02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:44.840]   and trying to invite in or allow in messages
[02:57:44.840 --> 02:57:48.580]   that if I didn't still myself, that I wouldn't hear.
[02:57:48.580 --> 02:57:50.020]   And sometimes I'll go to sleep
[02:57:50.020 --> 02:57:52.620]   and then the next morning something will come to mind.
[02:57:52.620 --> 02:57:53.460]   It's not always immediate, yeah.
[02:57:53.460 --> 02:57:55.300]   - Well, I don't think there's any real difference
[02:57:55.300 --> 02:57:56.980]   between that and revelation.
[02:57:56.980 --> 02:57:58.160]   So imagine that
[02:57:58.160 --> 02:58:04.740]   what speaks to you in intuition is the voice of your aim.
[02:58:04.740 --> 02:58:11.300]   Now, this would be true if your thoughts
[02:58:11.300 --> 02:58:16.420]   and the images that appear to you are tools, so to speak,
[02:58:16.420 --> 02:58:18.940]   to orient you towards your destination.
[02:58:18.940 --> 02:58:20.820]   Well, obviously, they have to be that.
[02:58:20.820 --> 02:58:24.260]   Because if your thoughts and your visions, let's say,
[02:58:24.260 --> 02:58:26.660]   didn't orient you towards your destination,
[02:58:26.660 --> 02:58:29.420]   they would be useless and you'd never get anywhere.
[02:58:29.420 --> 02:58:32.020]   Okay, so now you specify your aim.
[02:58:32.020 --> 02:58:34.500]   And it is the voice of that aim
[02:58:34.500 --> 02:58:36.060]   that will make itself manifest to you.
[02:58:36.060 --> 02:58:38.020]   That is what a revelation is.
[02:58:38.020 --> 02:58:40.300]   And one of these days when we have a podcast,
[02:58:40.300 --> 02:58:42.820]   I'd like to sit down and talk to you about the relationship,
[02:58:42.820 --> 02:58:46.980]   the formal relationship between thought and prayer.
[02:58:46.980 --> 02:58:51.100]   Because I think thought is secularized prayer.
[02:58:51.100 --> 02:58:52.740]   I mean, look at it's historic,
[02:58:52.740 --> 02:58:56.380]   'cause when did we start to think?
[02:58:56.380 --> 02:58:57.940]   That's not so obvious, you know?
[02:58:57.940 --> 02:59:00.980]   I mean, we started to think in words
[02:59:00.980 --> 02:59:03.340]   after we developed the ability to use language.
[02:59:03.340 --> 02:59:05.100]   What's that, 150,000 years?
[02:59:05.100 --> 02:59:06.180]   Maybe it's longer than that.
[02:59:06.180 --> 02:59:07.140]   No one really knows.
[02:59:07.140 --> 02:59:10.660]   But thought has its historical origins.
[02:59:10.660 --> 02:59:13.420]   The probability that it emerged from something like prayer,
[02:59:13.420 --> 02:59:15.300]   as far as I can tell, is 100%.
[02:59:15.300 --> 02:59:16.860]   But I'd like to, at some point,
[02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:17.700]   it's complicated,
[02:59:17.700 --> 02:59:21.020]   but I'd like to have a discussion with you about that.
[02:59:21.020 --> 02:59:26.020]   So imagine that to have an informative intuition
[02:59:26.020 --> 02:59:29.660]   means that you posit a question.
[02:59:29.660 --> 02:59:31.740]   And that's a form of humility.
[02:59:31.740 --> 02:59:34.140]   It's like, there's something I need to know
[02:59:34.140 --> 02:59:37.820]   that I don't know that I could know that I'd like to know.
[02:59:37.820 --> 02:59:39.420]   It's like, so you set the stage.
[02:59:39.420 --> 02:59:40.700]   Well, once you set the stage,
[02:59:40.700 --> 02:59:42.940]   the probability that a creative idea
[02:59:42.940 --> 02:59:45.540]   will enter the theater of your imagination
[02:59:45.540 --> 02:59:47.060]   is much enhanced.
[02:59:47.060 --> 02:59:49.300]   That's the first stage of revelation.
[02:59:49.300 --> 02:59:50.740]   Then you have to assess that.
[02:59:50.740 --> 02:59:53.780]   That's discriminating the spirits, you might say.
[02:59:53.780 --> 02:59:55.380]   You're separating the wheat from the chaff.
[02:59:55.380 --> 02:59:56.540]   That's critical thinking.
[02:59:56.540 --> 02:59:58.620]   But all of that, as far as I can tell,
[02:59:58.620 --> 03:00:02.460]   is something approximating secularized prayer.
[03:00:02.460 --> 03:00:03.580]   Set your aim.
[03:00:03.580 --> 03:00:09.500]   Then observe the manifestation of that aim.
[03:00:09.500 --> 03:00:12.140]   That, it's not even magical.
[03:00:12.140 --> 03:00:14.260]   It's how your perception works.
[03:00:14.260 --> 03:00:15.460]   Now, there's a magic to it,
[03:00:15.460 --> 03:00:19.100]   because I suppose the magic is that you can think up
[03:00:19.100 --> 03:00:21.180]   something you never thought up before.
[03:00:21.180 --> 03:00:23.100]   How the hell do you do that?
[03:00:23.100 --> 03:00:24.900]   It's more like you experience it, right?
[03:00:24.900 --> 03:00:26.460]   You set your aim, you have a question.
[03:00:26.460 --> 03:00:28.860]   So you're on your knees, hoping for an answer.
[03:00:28.860 --> 03:00:31.820]   The light bulb goes on.
[03:00:31.820 --> 03:00:35.300]   Well, if that's not revelation, then what the hell is it?
[03:00:35.300 --> 03:00:36.580]   It's the same thing.
[03:00:36.580 --> 03:00:39.300]   Having spent a good portion of my career
[03:00:39.300 --> 03:00:40.540]   digging around in brains,
[03:00:40.540 --> 03:00:44.220]   recording from neurons, slicing up brains, staining brains,
[03:00:44.220 --> 03:00:48.420]   and from my understanding of neuroscience,
[03:00:48.420 --> 03:00:51.580]   and I think by now in 2020, almost 2025,
[03:00:51.580 --> 03:00:52.780]   we have a fairly good understanding
[03:00:52.780 --> 03:00:54.140]   of what different brain areas do,
[03:00:54.140 --> 03:00:55.820]   how different circuits interact.
[03:00:55.820 --> 03:01:01.220]   I don't see how anyone who's really interested
[03:01:01.220 --> 03:01:06.220]   in how humans work can not believe in God.
[03:01:08.300 --> 03:01:10.660]   And I'm not being disparaging of people that don't.
[03:01:10.660 --> 03:01:14.140]   I know people that are atheists, I have some in my family,
[03:01:14.140 --> 03:01:18.420]   and I just don't think that the human brain and mind
[03:01:18.420 --> 03:01:22.540]   is capable of understanding and managing itself
[03:01:22.540 --> 03:01:24.500]   as well as it possibly could
[03:01:24.500 --> 03:01:29.260]   in the absence of a concept of God in prayer.
[03:01:29.260 --> 03:01:32.540]   And I think there's a lot of historical evidence
[03:01:32.540 --> 03:01:33.580]   to support that statement,
[03:01:33.580 --> 03:01:36.220]   meaning that this notion of God
[03:01:36.220 --> 03:01:38.540]   has been around a very long time.
[03:01:38.540 --> 03:01:39.580]   This is not a coincidence.
[03:01:39.580 --> 03:01:42.140]   I mean, humans have discarded many of the things
[03:01:42.140 --> 03:01:45.820]   that other people perhaps came up with.
[03:01:45.820 --> 03:01:48.300]   This has been a stable feature
[03:01:48.300 --> 03:01:50.700]   of being human for a very long time,
[03:01:50.700 --> 03:01:52.140]   of societies for a very long time.
[03:01:52.140 --> 03:01:54.340]   And I've been wanting to ask you
[03:01:54.340 --> 03:01:55.460]   throughout today's conversation,
[03:01:55.460 --> 03:01:58.660]   to what extent do you think the different religions
[03:01:58.660 --> 03:02:02.020]   and the way that they represent God differently,
[03:02:02.020 --> 03:02:04.820]   or in the case of Christianity, God and Jesus Christ,
[03:02:05.180 --> 03:02:09.140]   to what extent do you think that the stories
[03:02:09.140 --> 03:02:14.140]   and the lessons and the teachings overlap
[03:02:14.140 --> 03:02:16.980]   at the level that we're talking about today,
[03:02:16.980 --> 03:02:19.340]   which is really about a psychological
[03:02:19.340 --> 03:02:20.860]   and neuroscientific level?
[03:02:20.860 --> 03:02:23.940]   Seems to me that they all converge on the same themes,
[03:02:23.940 --> 03:02:26.260]   but I'm not, you know, I'm somewhat of a newbie
[03:02:26.260 --> 03:02:30.020]   to formal prayer and to reading the Bible and so on.
[03:02:30.020 --> 03:02:32.700]   So I like to say, you know, I haven't gotten my jersey yet
[03:02:32.700 --> 03:02:33.540]   'cause I don't deserve it,
[03:02:33.540 --> 03:02:36.020]   but I'm putting in, I'm showing up to practice,
[03:02:36.020 --> 03:02:37.020]   you know, this kind of thing.
[03:02:37.020 --> 03:02:40.100]   So I'm just curious to what extent you see
[03:02:40.100 --> 03:02:42.140]   consistent themes across religions,
[03:02:42.140 --> 03:02:44.260]   and maybe even to atheism too.
[03:02:44.260 --> 03:02:45.580]   Like atheism, it's been argued
[03:02:45.580 --> 03:02:48.140]   as its own form of religion perhaps, right?
[03:02:48.140 --> 03:02:50.820]   And for anyone listening, I mean, I wanna make clear,
[03:02:50.820 --> 03:02:55.820]   like the, there's, I don't have any pushback on atheism.
[03:02:55.820 --> 03:02:59.020]   It's just that for me, adopting,
[03:02:59.020 --> 03:03:02.300]   really coming to terms with a real belief in God,
[03:03:02.300 --> 03:03:05.580]   and adopting a prayer practice every single night,
[03:03:05.580 --> 03:03:08.300]   and also during the day, many times,
[03:03:08.300 --> 03:03:09.980]   and always before a podcast,
[03:03:09.980 --> 03:03:12.340]   has been just tremendously beneficial to my life.
[03:03:12.340 --> 03:03:14.460]   So that's why I'm gonna continue to do it.
[03:03:14.460 --> 03:03:16.580]   Why wouldn't I?
[03:03:16.580 --> 03:03:17.500]   But that's the question.
[03:03:17.500 --> 03:03:18.420]   To what extent do different,
[03:03:18.420 --> 03:03:20.980]   the way that different religions represent God,
[03:03:20.980 --> 03:03:25.980]   you think across religions converge on common themes?
[03:03:25.980 --> 03:03:28.220]   - Well, I think they converge substantively.
[03:03:28.220 --> 03:03:30.460]   I mean, I think the best,
[03:03:30.460 --> 03:03:35.220]   I talked to Camille Paglia about this a few years ago.
[03:03:35.220 --> 03:03:38.940]   Maybe she's one of the world's foremost literary theorists,
[03:03:38.940 --> 03:03:40.700]   and she said something very interesting to me
[03:03:40.700 --> 03:03:42.020]   that was quite surprising.
[03:03:42.020 --> 03:03:46.260]   She said that had the academy turned to Eric Neumann,
[03:03:46.260 --> 03:03:49.060]   who is Jung's greatest student, by the way,
[03:03:49.060 --> 03:03:53.900]   instead of Foucault, the whole history of the university
[03:03:53.900 --> 03:03:56.580]   and the intellectual enterprise over the last five decades
[03:03:56.580 --> 03:03:57.700]   would have been entirely different.
[03:03:57.700 --> 03:03:58.980]   - What happened with Foucault?
[03:03:58.980 --> 03:04:00.500]   - What happened with Foucault?
[03:04:00.500 --> 03:04:04.580]   - Well, Foucault is the most cited scholar who ever lived.
[03:04:04.580 --> 03:04:09.100]   And Foucault believes that the story that we act out
[03:04:09.100 --> 03:04:12.660]   is one of power, and that's wrong.
[03:04:12.660 --> 03:04:13.740]   And it's not just wrong,
[03:04:13.740 --> 03:04:16.300]   it's like perversely and dangerously wrong.
[03:04:16.300 --> 03:04:18.420]   I think it's technically wrong,
[03:04:18.420 --> 03:04:20.060]   as well as being ethically wrong,
[03:04:20.060 --> 03:04:23.740]   partly because power does not provide a stable basis
[03:04:23.740 --> 03:04:27.340]   for psychological integration or social unity.
[03:04:27.340 --> 03:04:29.500]   It's just, it's not.
[03:04:29.500 --> 03:04:32.740]   Power might be more effective adaptively
[03:04:32.740 --> 03:04:35.740]   than capitulation and dependence,
[03:04:35.740 --> 03:04:39.660]   but it's not an optimized solution,
[03:04:39.660 --> 03:04:41.500]   not by any stretch of the imagination.
[03:04:41.500 --> 03:04:45.460]   And I think the data demonstrating that,
[03:04:45.460 --> 03:04:47.940]   I think it's incontrovertible.
[03:04:47.940 --> 03:04:51.460]   And I outline that in this book, "Will You Wrestle With God?"
[03:04:51.460 --> 03:04:56.660]   Eric Neumann, Carl Jung, Mircea Eliade,
[03:04:56.660 --> 03:04:58.460]   a host of others,
[03:04:58.460 --> 03:05:02.020]   outlined the patterns of religious thinking,
[03:05:02.020 --> 03:05:04.660]   and it took them most of the 20th century to do that,
[03:05:04.660 --> 03:05:07.540]   and they found recurring themes that are profound.
[03:05:07.540 --> 03:05:09.540]   So one example,
[03:05:09.540 --> 03:05:13.420]   the ancient Egyptians worshiped a god, Horus.
[03:05:13.420 --> 03:05:14.980]   Everyone knows the god Horus,
[03:05:14.980 --> 03:05:18.900]   because his emblem is the eye, the open eye.
[03:05:18.900 --> 03:05:20.980]   Well, what does that mean?
[03:05:20.980 --> 03:05:21.820]   But it means in part
[03:05:21.820 --> 03:05:25.140]   that the ancient Egyptians worshiped attention,
[03:05:26.300 --> 03:05:29.980]   and they felt that the god of attention
[03:05:29.980 --> 03:05:32.740]   was the antidote to the pathological state.
[03:05:32.740 --> 03:05:36.180]   And they were right about that.
[03:05:36.180 --> 03:05:38.380]   They had a god of the pathological state.
[03:05:38.380 --> 03:05:40.660]   That was Seth.
[03:05:40.660 --> 03:05:42.500]   The god Seth, the name Seth,
[03:05:42.500 --> 03:05:46.540]   became Satan through the Coptic,
[03:05:46.540 --> 03:05:48.300]   through the Coptic Christians.
[03:05:48.300 --> 03:05:51.980]   So they believed that the degenerate state had a spirit,
[03:05:51.980 --> 03:05:55.120]   and the antidote to the spirit of the degenerate state
[03:05:55.120 --> 03:05:56.700]   was the all-seeing,
[03:05:56.700 --> 03:06:02.180]   the all-seeing, upward-striving eye.
[03:06:02.180 --> 03:06:03.060]   And that's right.
[03:06:03.060 --> 03:06:04.460]   It's like they'd nailed that.
[03:06:04.460 --> 03:06:06.660]   - That sounds like what you were saying before.
[03:06:06.660 --> 03:06:07.740]   Where you set your sights.
[03:06:07.740 --> 03:06:08.740]   Where you set your sights. - Yes, exactly.
[03:06:08.740 --> 03:06:11.720]   - High and to the heavens,
[03:06:11.720 --> 03:06:13.580]   and then to the most proximal thing
[03:06:13.580 --> 03:06:15.980]   that's gonna deliver you to the next rung.
[03:06:15.980 --> 03:06:17.060]   - Well, and there's a difference
[03:06:17.060 --> 03:06:19.860]   between attention and thinking.
[03:06:19.860 --> 03:06:22.420]   Like, attention is a quest.
[03:06:22.420 --> 03:06:23.420]   If you're paying attention,
[03:06:23.420 --> 03:06:25.200]   you're looking, you're seeking,
[03:06:25.200 --> 03:06:27.860]   you're knocking, you're asking, right?
[03:06:27.860 --> 03:06:32.660]   And the eternal promise is that if you ask,
[03:06:32.660 --> 03:06:33.880]   you'll be answered.
[03:06:33.880 --> 03:06:35.240]   And if you seek, you'll find.
[03:06:35.240 --> 03:06:38.240]   And the eye is the gateway to that.
[03:06:38.240 --> 03:06:40.800]   And it's the antidote to the degenerate state
[03:06:40.800 --> 03:06:43.520]   because the degenerate state,
[03:06:43.520 --> 03:06:44.760]   the totalitarian state,
[03:06:44.760 --> 03:06:47.240]   insists and tyrannizes,
[03:06:47.240 --> 03:06:49.280]   and the open eye seeks.
[03:06:49.280 --> 03:06:50.840]   Well, the Egyptians figured this out,
[03:06:50.840 --> 03:06:53.560]   and the Egyptian theology had a walloping impact
[03:06:53.560 --> 03:06:55.640]   on Jewish theology.
[03:06:55.640 --> 03:06:57.520]   I mean, the Jews came out of Egypt.
[03:06:57.520 --> 03:07:01.720]   Like, that's a conception.
[03:07:01.720 --> 03:07:04.020]   There are consequences of that conceptually
[03:07:04.020 --> 03:07:05.880]   as well as historically.
[03:07:05.880 --> 03:07:08.360]   The pattern of the hero's journey,
[03:07:08.360 --> 03:07:10.360]   that's replicated.
[03:07:10.360 --> 03:07:12.160]   I would say that's the central pattern
[03:07:12.160 --> 03:07:14.520]   of story per se.
[03:07:14.520 --> 03:07:16.280]   And that makes itself manifest
[03:07:16.280 --> 03:07:18.860]   in perhaps all cultures that have managed
[03:07:18.860 --> 03:07:21.880]   any unity in any progress whatsoever.
[03:07:21.880 --> 03:07:25.220]   Is there a hierarchy of religious truth?
[03:07:25.220 --> 03:07:31.040]   Yes, just as there's a hierarchy in literary depth.
[03:07:31.040 --> 03:07:34.960]   We understand that a dime store romance
[03:07:34.960 --> 03:07:37.640]   is not as profound as a Dostoevsky novel.
[03:07:37.640 --> 03:07:39.400]   We know there's a hierarchy of depth.
[03:07:39.400 --> 03:07:43.460]   And you can arrange religious apprehension
[03:07:43.460 --> 03:07:46.040]   in terms of a hierarchy of quality.
[03:07:46.040 --> 03:07:49.680]   And I think the Jungian school did that brilliantly,
[03:07:49.680 --> 03:07:51.520]   brilliantly, and biologists should know it
[03:07:51.520 --> 03:07:52.360]   in far more depth.
[03:07:52.360 --> 03:07:56.120]   The best neuroscientists of emotion and motivation
[03:07:56.120 --> 03:07:58.820]   that I knew, and that includes Joachim Panksepp,
[03:07:58.820 --> 03:08:03.540]   they knew the work of Iliad, for example.
[03:08:03.540 --> 03:08:05.420]   Which of those readings would you recommend
[03:08:05.420 --> 03:08:07.180]   for somebody who's interested in psychology
[03:08:07.180 --> 03:08:09.060]   and neuroscience explained at that level?
[03:08:09.060 --> 03:08:12.500]   I would start with "The Sacred and the Profane" by Iliad.
[03:08:12.500 --> 03:08:16.980]   And also Eric Neumann's book,
[03:08:16.980 --> 03:08:19.620]   "The Origins and History of Consciousness."
[03:08:19.620 --> 03:08:21.420]   That's a harder one because it's,
[03:08:21.420 --> 03:08:25.100]   unless you know the lingo of that school,
[03:08:25.100 --> 03:08:29.000]   it's hard to understand what he's aiming at.
[03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:30.940]   If you understand that he's aiming at,
[03:08:30.940 --> 03:08:35.460]   he's elaborating on the symbolism
[03:08:35.460 --> 03:08:36.980]   of the adventurous spirit.
[03:08:36.980 --> 03:08:38.780]   That's a good way of thinking about it.
[03:08:38.780 --> 03:08:41.140]   It's a technical analysis of the structure
[03:08:41.140 --> 03:08:43.820]   of heroic expansion of personality.
[03:08:43.820 --> 03:08:48.300]   But an easier way in is through Iliad,
[03:08:48.300 --> 03:08:49.460]   "Sacred and the Profane."
[03:08:49.460 --> 03:08:53.240]   Short book, you would read it now knowing
[03:08:53.240 --> 03:08:56.500]   that the gods that Iliad described as warring
[03:08:56.500 --> 03:09:00.980]   in the pagan world are in part manifestations
[03:09:00.980 --> 03:09:04.300]   of the personality of motivational drive.
[03:09:04.300 --> 03:09:07.060]   And the mapping of that war across times,
[03:09:07.060 --> 03:09:08.620]   that's the war of the gods in heaven,
[03:09:08.620 --> 03:09:10.980]   which is a very common mythological trope.
[03:09:10.980 --> 03:09:14.060]   There's a war that integrates towards a monotheism.
[03:09:14.060 --> 03:09:16.580]   And Iliad had tracked that in multiple cultures.
[03:09:16.580 --> 03:09:19.100]   And that's very, it's very much worth knowing.
[03:09:19.100 --> 03:09:23.820]   Because it explains, it explains the symbolism
[03:09:23.820 --> 03:09:28.680]   of the emergence of the integrated literate human psyche
[03:09:28.680 --> 03:09:32.020]   across tens of thousands of years.
[03:09:32.020 --> 03:09:34.100]   That's captured in story.
[03:09:34.100 --> 03:09:36.100]   So imagine this, here's a way of thinking about it.
[03:09:36.100 --> 03:09:39.600]   So tribe A, tribe B, tribe C.
[03:09:39.600 --> 03:09:41.540]   Now they all have their highest deity
[03:09:41.540 --> 03:09:43.460]   or their panoply of deities.
[03:09:43.460 --> 03:09:45.060]   Now they unite.
[03:09:45.060 --> 03:09:47.460]   Okay, so as they unite, they fight,
[03:09:47.460 --> 03:09:49.100]   they compete, and they cooperate.
[03:09:49.100 --> 03:09:51.840]   They kill each other, they cooperate and trade.
[03:09:51.840 --> 03:09:53.220]   At the same time that's happening,
[03:09:53.220 --> 03:09:55.980]   there's a war in the space of ideas
[03:09:55.980 --> 03:09:58.620]   between their respective deities.
[03:09:58.620 --> 03:10:00.300]   And you could think about the human beings
[03:10:00.300 --> 03:10:03.940]   acting out that war just as you could think about the war,
[03:10:03.940 --> 03:10:06.980]   the abstraction reflecting the conflict on earth.
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:09.640]   Well, there's a pattern to that conflict.
[03:10:09.640 --> 03:10:11.960]   That pattern is quite stable across cultures.
[03:10:11.960 --> 03:10:14.800]   It tilts towards a monotheistic unity
[03:10:14.800 --> 03:10:18.360]   in so far as the multiplicity of cultures unifies.
[03:10:18.360 --> 03:10:19.920]   Well, obviously.
[03:10:19.920 --> 03:10:21.560]   Like, what are they gonna unify
[03:10:21.560 --> 03:10:23.680]   in the absence of conceptual unity?
[03:10:23.680 --> 03:10:25.240]   I don't think so.
[03:10:25.240 --> 03:10:27.620]   And why wouldn't it be that the movement
[03:10:27.620 --> 03:10:29.300]   towards that conceptual unity,
[03:10:29.300 --> 03:10:32.480]   which is the establishment of a larger scale civilization,
[03:10:32.480 --> 03:10:36.280]   would involve the battle between ideas of the divine
[03:10:36.280 --> 03:10:39.280]   and their integration into something resembling a unity?
[03:10:39.280 --> 03:10:40.600]   Like, clearly.
[03:10:40.600 --> 03:10:42.600]   Well, that's part of the proclamation,
[03:10:42.600 --> 03:10:45.820]   let's say, of the analytic psychologists
[03:10:45.820 --> 03:10:48.160]   that were all part of Carl Jung's school.
[03:10:48.160 --> 03:10:51.800]   And the academy just ignored that entirely,
[03:10:51.800 --> 03:10:53.480]   except for Camille Paglia,
[03:10:53.480 --> 03:10:55.840]   who understands this quite profoundly,
[03:10:55.840 --> 03:10:58.180]   and went in the direction of Foucault.
[03:10:58.180 --> 03:10:59.480]   - These are these lineages
[03:10:59.480 --> 03:11:01.000]   that we were talking about before.
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:02.660]   It's hard for people to appreciate
[03:11:02.660 --> 03:11:05.140]   just how powerful these academic lineages are
[03:11:05.140 --> 03:11:06.280]   and scientific lineages are,
[03:11:06.280 --> 03:11:08.200]   because they set trajectories.
[03:11:08.200 --> 03:11:10.760]   - And they define what's forbidden.
[03:11:10.760 --> 03:11:15.640]   Like, all the people that advised me as a graduate student,
[03:11:15.640 --> 03:11:18.600]   even those who had my best interests firmly in mind,
[03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:20.360]   told me to never talk about
[03:11:20.360 --> 03:11:22.040]   my interest in Jungian psychology.
[03:11:22.040 --> 03:11:22.880]   - Really? - Yeah, yeah.
[03:11:22.880 --> 03:11:24.720]   - Sorry, I'm laughing 'cause it's so preposterous.
[03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:27.960]   - Yeah, well, it's not surprising.
[03:11:27.960 --> 03:11:31.680]   I mean, I always did when I went for job interviews,
[03:11:31.680 --> 03:11:35.020]   and that definitely was part of what scuttled at me
[03:11:35.020 --> 03:11:37.400]   at some of the places I interviewed.
[03:11:37.400 --> 03:11:41.120]   Now, fortunately, they hired me at Harvard.
[03:11:41.120 --> 03:11:46.120]   And so, what I was discussing was verboten in many places,
[03:11:46.120 --> 03:11:49.320]   but not there.
[03:11:49.320 --> 03:11:51.200]   So, you know, that worked out quite nicely for me.
[03:11:51.200 --> 03:11:52.720]   - Yeah, I was gonna say, clearly it worked out.
[03:11:52.720 --> 03:11:53.920]   - Yes, yes. - I've been meaning
[03:11:53.920 --> 03:11:57.040]   to ask you, I've been reading a really interesting book
[03:11:57.040 --> 03:12:01.080]   recently that's basically grounded in Adlerian psychology.
[03:12:01.080 --> 03:12:01.920]   - Yeah.
[03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:03.720]   - I wasn't familiar with Adlerian psychology.
[03:12:03.720 --> 03:12:05.500]   - Yeah, Adler's very practical.
[03:12:05.500 --> 03:12:08.660]   - The book talks about Adler as a counterpoint
[03:12:08.660 --> 03:12:09.900]   to Freud and Jung.
[03:12:09.900 --> 03:12:10.860]   - What's the book?
[03:12:10.860 --> 03:12:13.660]   - The book is called "The Courage to be Disliked,"
[03:12:13.660 --> 03:12:16.240]   and I highly recommend it to everybody.
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:17.900]   It was actually written by a Japanese author.
[03:12:17.900 --> 03:12:19.140]   I think there are two Japanese authors.
[03:12:19.140 --> 03:12:21.520]   It didn't get quite so popular in this country,
[03:12:21.520 --> 03:12:24.820]   but it had a big following in Japan,
[03:12:24.820 --> 03:12:27.420]   and I think in other places in Asia.
[03:12:27.420 --> 03:12:30.820]   And the book is set up as a conversation
[03:12:30.820 --> 03:12:34.720]   between essentially a philosopher of Adlerian psychology
[03:12:34.720 --> 03:12:37.300]   and a student who's challenging him.
[03:12:37.300 --> 03:12:40.140]   So it's a conversation that raises all the challenges
[03:12:40.140 --> 03:12:42.980]   that would come to one's mind if you were to be presented
[03:12:42.980 --> 03:12:44.820]   with this idea of life tasks,
[03:12:44.820 --> 03:12:46.580]   and that we're supposed to discard with our thoughts
[03:12:46.580 --> 03:12:48.540]   about prior trauma and just figure out
[03:12:48.540 --> 03:12:50.700]   what are our tasks now.
[03:12:50.700 --> 03:12:51.540]   - Right, right, right.
[03:12:51.540 --> 03:12:53.340]   - And I like the practicality of it.
[03:12:53.340 --> 03:12:54.460]   - Adler's very practical.
[03:12:54.460 --> 03:12:55.300]   - Yeah, I like that.
[03:12:55.300 --> 03:12:57.300]   I was just curious what your thoughts were about that.
[03:12:57.300 --> 03:12:59.860]   It seems to fit quite well with your notions
[03:12:59.860 --> 03:13:01.500]   and what you've talked about in multiple books,
[03:13:01.500 --> 03:13:04.820]   including the most recent one, the one that's out now,
[03:13:04.820 --> 03:13:08.660]   about getting really serious about what your tasks are
[03:13:08.660 --> 03:13:11.180]   at this moment in time and embracing those tasks
[03:13:11.180 --> 03:13:13.380]   as a way to progress forward,
[03:13:13.380 --> 03:13:17.700]   as opposed to floundering in notions about the past.
[03:13:17.700 --> 03:13:20.380]   And I think it might hit some people square upside the head
[03:13:20.380 --> 03:13:23.300]   when there's, I think, one of the chapters opens
[03:13:23.300 --> 03:13:25.200]   with the words, "There's no such thing as trauma,"
[03:13:25.200 --> 03:13:26.960]   which is clearly not true.
[03:13:26.960 --> 03:13:29.840]   But the whole idea is to prompt a different way of thinking.
[03:13:29.840 --> 03:13:33.420]   And to let people start to drill into like,
[03:13:33.420 --> 03:13:35.300]   okay, what do I need to do now,
[03:13:35.300 --> 03:13:37.260]   regardless of what my parents did or didn't do?
[03:13:37.260 --> 03:13:38.820]   - Regardless of my damaged self.
[03:13:38.820 --> 03:13:40.100]   - Right, regardless of my damaged self.
[03:13:40.100 --> 03:13:42.820]   And I must say, I really like the book.
[03:13:42.820 --> 03:13:43.660]   - Well, I would say-
[03:13:43.660 --> 03:13:47.060]   - I should say, I really like the concept
[03:13:47.060 --> 03:13:51.900]   of embracing task while agonizing over the meaning of life
[03:13:51.900 --> 03:13:52.860]   and what one is to do.
[03:13:52.860 --> 03:13:55.180]   - Yes, well, Adler was the most practical
[03:13:55.180 --> 03:14:00.120]   of the small crowd that aggregated around Freud.
[03:14:00.120 --> 03:14:04.280]   And so Jung's take was that Freud focused on sex
[03:14:04.280 --> 03:14:06.520]   and Adler focused on power
[03:14:06.520 --> 03:14:09.000]   and Jung focused on what transcended both.
[03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:10.320]   And I think that's right.
[03:14:10.320 --> 03:14:13.040]   Now, Adler is a good riposte to Freud
[03:14:13.040 --> 03:14:15.160]   in exactly the way you described.
[03:14:15.160 --> 03:14:16.440]   If you like that book
[03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:19.060]   and you're interested in all three of them, let's say,
[03:14:19.060 --> 03:14:22.440]   there's a great book called "Discovery of the Unconscious,"
[03:14:22.440 --> 03:14:25.220]   which was written by a man named Henri Ellenberger
[03:14:25.220 --> 03:14:27.420]   who was the foremost exponent
[03:14:27.420 --> 03:14:30.220]   of existential psychology in the 1950s.
[03:14:30.220 --> 03:14:31.740]   Brilliant, brilliant scholar.
[03:14:31.740 --> 03:14:34.860]   And it is the best analysis of Freud, Jung, and Adler
[03:14:34.860 --> 03:14:36.540]   that's ever been written by a lot.
[03:14:36.540 --> 03:14:38.380]   And it's a truly great book.
[03:14:38.380 --> 03:14:41.460]   He also traces the idea of the unconscious
[03:14:41.460 --> 03:14:44.480]   back 350 years before Freud.
[03:14:44.480 --> 03:14:46.300]   So it's a masterful study.
[03:14:46.300 --> 03:14:48.700]   But I liked Adler
[03:14:48.700 --> 03:14:51.500]   and he was much less charismatic than Freud and Jung.
[03:14:51.500 --> 03:14:53.680]   And so his star didn't shine as brightly.
[03:14:53.680 --> 03:14:55.800]   But he's very practically oriented
[03:14:55.800 --> 03:14:59.320]   and much of his thinking, what would you say,
[03:14:59.320 --> 03:15:03.240]   fits quite nicely with the same kind of bottom-up approach
[03:15:03.240 --> 03:15:05.880]   that a more behaviorally oriented psychotherapist
[03:15:05.880 --> 03:15:07.200]   would employ.
[03:15:07.200 --> 03:15:11.980]   So, look, there are some people,
[03:15:11.980 --> 03:15:18.400]   if you're engaging in a therapeutic process with someone,
[03:15:18.400 --> 03:15:21.280]   there are people who are best engaged with
[03:15:21.280 --> 03:15:23.540]   at the level of concept.
[03:15:23.540 --> 03:15:26.600]   Those are people who are high in trait openness.
[03:15:26.600 --> 03:15:27.860]   Not everyone's like that.
[03:15:27.860 --> 03:15:29.920]   In fact, most people aren't like that.
[03:15:29.920 --> 03:15:31.880]   Jungian psychology works really well
[03:15:31.880 --> 03:15:33.220]   on highly creative people.
[03:15:33.220 --> 03:15:36.200]   And almost all Jung's clients were creative
[03:15:36.200 --> 03:15:38.960]   'cause they wouldn't have come to him otherwise.
[03:15:38.960 --> 03:15:43.160]   And there's also people for whom sexual dysfunction
[03:15:43.160 --> 03:15:47.680]   and trauma are the primary, what would you say,
[03:15:47.680 --> 03:15:51.120]   the primary preoccupation of their life and the past.
[03:15:51.120 --> 03:15:54.620]   And Freud serves them well.
[03:15:54.620 --> 03:15:56.600]   Adler's very practical.
[03:15:56.600 --> 03:15:59.540]   And if you're looking for a psychologist
[03:15:59.540 --> 03:16:03.320]   to help you figure out how you could advance
[03:16:03.320 --> 03:16:04.760]   from where you are now,
[03:16:04.760 --> 03:16:08.640]   he's got plenty of things to say that are good.
[03:16:08.640 --> 03:16:10.960]   He also wasn't as good a literary stylist
[03:16:10.960 --> 03:16:12.880]   as Jung or Freud.
[03:16:12.880 --> 03:16:15.080]   So that also put him off to the side to some degree.
[03:16:15.080 --> 03:16:18.040]   But anyways, a deeper investigation
[03:16:18.040 --> 03:16:20.560]   can certainly be found in "Discovery of the Unconscious."
[03:16:20.560 --> 03:16:22.440]   And for anybody listening and watching
[03:16:22.440 --> 03:16:26.560]   who's interested in psychological ideas broadly
[03:16:26.560 --> 03:16:28.320]   and would like familiarity
[03:16:28.320 --> 03:16:30.600]   with the psychoanalytic tradition,
[03:16:30.600 --> 03:16:32.440]   Freud, Jung, and Adler, let's say primary,
[03:16:32.440 --> 03:16:33.680]   there is not a better book
[03:16:33.680 --> 03:16:35.020]   than "Discovery of the Unconscious."
[03:16:35.020 --> 03:16:36.880]   It's really a work of genius.
[03:16:36.880 --> 03:16:38.400]   - You know what's missing from the literature?
[03:16:38.400 --> 03:16:39.880]   Thank you for those, by the way,
[03:16:39.880 --> 03:16:42.540]   is a really excellent up-to-date book
[03:16:42.540 --> 03:16:46.120]   on neuroscience and the mind and psychology.
[03:16:46.120 --> 03:16:47.800]   Perhaps we write one together.
[03:16:47.800 --> 03:16:48.640]   - Yeah, yeah, well, that's--
[03:16:48.640 --> 03:16:50.280]   - I mean, it's just not out there.
[03:16:50.280 --> 03:16:51.640]   I mean, there are textbooks on neuroscience.
[03:16:51.640 --> 03:16:53.280]   There's a lot of discussion, as you know,
[03:16:53.280 --> 03:16:54.720]   about free will, lack of free will,
[03:16:54.720 --> 03:16:56.800]   depending on which author you're paying attention to.
[03:16:56.800 --> 03:17:01.120]   But there isn't really a satisfactory book
[03:17:01.120 --> 03:17:04.640]   about the brain, the mind, and psychology.
[03:17:04.640 --> 03:17:06.120]   This just doesn't exist.
[03:17:06.120 --> 03:17:08.200]   - Yeah, the closest one I ever encountered
[03:17:08.200 --> 03:17:10.440]   probably is "Affective Neuroscience,"
[03:17:10.440 --> 03:17:11.440]   Panksepp's book.
[03:17:11.440 --> 03:17:14.560]   - He's, I'm so, I must say,
[03:17:14.560 --> 03:17:16.040]   you've mentioned Panksepp a few times
[03:17:16.040 --> 03:17:18.520]   and Jaak Panksepp, as some of you may know,
[03:17:18.520 --> 03:17:19.760]   but perhaps most of you don't,
[03:17:19.760 --> 03:17:22.200]   was such a gift to science.
[03:17:22.200 --> 03:17:23.560]   And the fact that,
[03:17:23.560 --> 03:17:25.160]   I think the first time I heard you lecture
[03:17:25.160 --> 03:17:26.200]   in one of your YouTube lectures,
[03:17:26.200 --> 03:17:27.720]   you mentioned Jaak Panksepp and I thought,
[03:17:27.720 --> 03:17:30.440]   "Okay, this guy knows the good stuff."
[03:17:30.440 --> 03:17:31.960]   Because he was the first one to talk about
[03:17:31.960 --> 03:17:33.600]   juvenile play as a way of exploring
[03:17:33.600 --> 03:17:35.360]   circuitry and social dynamics.
[03:17:35.360 --> 03:17:36.200]   Such a--
[03:17:36.200 --> 03:17:37.280]   - And that fit, by the way,
[03:17:37.280 --> 03:17:41.120]   that fit perfectly with Piaget's observations
[03:17:41.120 --> 03:17:42.520]   of childhood socialization.
[03:17:42.520 --> 03:17:44.760]   It's like I came across Panksepp and I thought,
[03:17:44.760 --> 03:17:46.600]   "Oh, that's so cool.
[03:17:46.600 --> 03:17:49.160]   "Now we have the psychophysiological basis
[03:17:49.160 --> 03:17:51.280]   "for Piagetian developmental theory."
[03:17:51.280 --> 03:17:52.480]   Was perfect.
[03:17:52.480 --> 03:17:55.280]   Yeah, so that was lovely concordance.
[03:17:55.280 --> 03:17:59.200]   - Youngsepp would have been far more recognized
[03:17:59.200 --> 03:18:01.600]   had he been, he was at Bowling Green University, I think.
[03:18:01.600 --> 03:18:03.960]   And so, smaller university,
[03:18:03.960 --> 03:18:04.840]   perhaps, I don't know,
[03:18:04.840 --> 03:18:05.960]   I didn't ever hear a lecture
[03:18:05.960 --> 03:18:07.080]   and maybe not as charismatic
[03:18:07.080 --> 03:18:08.680]   as some of the other luminaries
[03:18:08.680 --> 03:18:10.360]   of neuroscience at that time, but--
[03:18:10.360 --> 03:18:12.640]   - Yeah, I don't know how he was as a lecturer.
[03:18:12.640 --> 03:18:14.000]   He's a great writer.
[03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:16.880]   And man, he had an unerring eye for the right problems
[03:18:16.880 --> 03:18:19.240]   in terms of psychological investigation.
[03:18:19.240 --> 03:18:21.000]   And very brave in that regard.
[03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:24.200]   I mean, he studied laughter in rats.
[03:18:24.200 --> 03:18:26.880]   And you think, "Oh, of all the absurd things to focus on."
[03:18:26.880 --> 03:18:29.920]   It's like, "No, you just don't understand where the goal is
[03:18:29.920 --> 03:18:31.120]   "or play among rats.
[03:18:31.120 --> 03:18:32.480]   "Who cares that rats play?"
[03:18:32.480 --> 03:18:35.360]   Well, that would be the sort of research proposal
[03:18:35.360 --> 03:18:38.360]   that would be pilloried by sensible Republicans
[03:18:38.360 --> 03:18:40.080]   looking to trim government waste.
[03:18:40.080 --> 03:18:41.040]   It's like, "No."
[03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:43.320]   That was the heart of the matter, right?
[03:18:43.320 --> 03:18:46.440]   Rats organize their social hierarchy through play,
[03:18:46.440 --> 03:18:48.960]   not through force, right?
[03:18:48.960 --> 03:18:50.920]   That's a big discovery.
[03:18:50.920 --> 03:18:53.400]   Like that's, I think he should have won a Nobel Prize.
[03:18:53.400 --> 03:18:54.240]   - I do too.
[03:18:54.240 --> 03:18:55.160]   - Yeah, he should have won a Nobel
[03:18:55.160 --> 03:18:56.640]   for a variety of his discoveries,
[03:18:56.640 --> 03:18:58.320]   but that one in particular.
[03:18:58.320 --> 03:19:02.000]   Like rats have an implicit morality.
[03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:05.640]   That's a major league, and it's based on play.
[03:19:05.640 --> 03:19:07.560]   Wow, stunning.
[03:19:07.560 --> 03:19:09.640]   - And we see the same thing in kids, obviously.
[03:19:09.640 --> 03:19:11.880]   - And well, we see the same thing in chimpanzees.
[03:19:11.880 --> 03:19:14.280]   Like, it's pretty strange to understand
[03:19:14.280 --> 03:19:17.800]   that dominance hierarchies, if they're functional,
[03:19:17.800 --> 03:19:22.200]   are often organized in consequence of play, not force.
[03:19:22.200 --> 03:19:25.360]   Like, so much for Foucault.
[03:19:25.360 --> 03:19:29.640]   - When you look out on the landscape of social media,
[03:19:29.640 --> 03:19:32.800]   do you see elements of that as well?
[03:19:32.800 --> 03:19:34.120]   That there's sort of a playfulness
[03:19:34.120 --> 03:19:37.360]   among people that's establishing a hierarchy?
[03:19:37.360 --> 03:19:39.280]   It seems like Elon's having a good time
[03:19:39.280 --> 03:19:42.800]   with his rockets and his X and Tesla.
[03:19:42.800 --> 03:19:44.600]   - I think that there is,
[03:19:44.600 --> 03:19:48.840]   I think that the antithesis of tyranny is play.
[03:19:48.840 --> 03:19:50.960]   It took me a long time to realize that.
[03:19:50.960 --> 03:19:53.360]   Like, I've been studying evil intensely
[03:19:53.360 --> 03:19:55.320]   since I was about 13.
[03:19:55.320 --> 03:19:58.800]   And evil is easier to define than good.
[03:19:58.800 --> 03:20:01.840]   It's hard to find a category
[03:20:01.840 --> 03:20:04.080]   that integrates all that's good,
[03:20:04.080 --> 03:20:08.120]   that you can point to simply.
[03:20:08.120 --> 03:20:09.480]   But it has,
[03:20:09.480 --> 03:20:13.680]   the fact that play is the antithesis of tyranny
[03:20:13.680 --> 03:20:15.520]   seems to be a pretty good summation.
[03:20:15.520 --> 03:20:17.080]   Like, Panksepp showed, for example,
[03:20:17.080 --> 03:20:18.800]   that play wouldn't emerge among animals
[03:20:18.800 --> 03:20:21.600]   if they were possessed by any other motivational state.
[03:20:21.600 --> 03:20:23.360]   Things have to be set up very carefully
[03:20:23.360 --> 03:20:25.040]   before play will emerge.
[03:20:25.040 --> 03:20:27.960]   Your house is optimally structured
[03:20:27.960 --> 03:20:30.040]   if your children can play.
[03:20:30.040 --> 03:20:31.880]   Your marriage is optimally structured
[03:20:31.880 --> 03:20:33.880]   if you're playing house with your wife.
[03:20:33.880 --> 03:20:37.760]   And I think that that reality of the,
[03:20:37.760 --> 03:20:38.720]   what would you say,
[03:20:38.720 --> 03:20:42.840]   the optimally superordinate nature of play,
[03:20:42.840 --> 03:20:44.840]   that makes itself manifest
[03:20:44.840 --> 03:20:47.760]   when you're watching someone who's a master at their task.
[03:20:47.760 --> 03:20:49.680]   And Musk is playing.
[03:20:49.680 --> 03:20:50.920]   And hopefully that will,
[03:20:50.920 --> 03:20:52.760]   you know, and Trump plays too.
[03:20:52.760 --> 03:20:53.600]   It's one of the things
[03:20:53.600 --> 03:20:56.400]   that made me less uncertain about him.
[03:20:56.400 --> 03:21:00.000]   He's deadly funny.
[03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:01.800]   Now, it's rough.
[03:21:01.800 --> 03:21:03.840]   He plays rough, no doubt about it.
[03:21:03.880 --> 03:21:05.920]   But he's ridiculously,
[03:21:05.920 --> 03:21:08.560]   he's got a ridiculously comic touch.
[03:21:08.560 --> 03:21:10.120]   And that's not something
[03:21:10.120 --> 03:21:12.440]   that's generally characteristic of,
[03:21:12.440 --> 03:21:14.560]   you know, psychopathic dictators.
[03:21:14.560 --> 03:21:17.520]   Hitler wasn't known for his sense of humor.
[03:21:17.520 --> 03:21:19.840]   - Let's talk about sense of humor, if you don't mind,
[03:21:19.840 --> 03:21:24.600]   because I think it's something that's sorely lacking
[03:21:24.600 --> 03:21:29.200]   in a lot of the discourse among adults, so to speak.
[03:21:29.200 --> 03:21:31.400]   And I think these days,
[03:21:31.400 --> 03:21:34.080]   I think a lot about what young people are observing.
[03:21:34.080 --> 03:21:37.280]   A few years back, I was watching this show.
[03:21:37.280 --> 03:21:38.280]   I didn't like it.
[03:21:38.280 --> 03:21:42.320]   Forgive me, because I think the actor was quite good.
[03:21:42.320 --> 03:21:45.280]   But the show was "Californication" with David Duchovny.
[03:21:45.280 --> 03:21:46.920]   And I realized,
[03:21:46.920 --> 03:21:49.360]   this show is all about the adults acting like children
[03:21:49.360 --> 03:21:50.720]   and the children acting like adults.
[03:21:50.720 --> 03:21:53.040]   - Oh yeah, that's a typical Hollywood inversion.
[03:21:53.040 --> 03:21:56.840]   - And I thought, this is terrible.
[03:21:56.840 --> 03:21:59.040]   Not because I'm some sort of moral avenger or something,
[03:21:59.040 --> 03:22:01.000]   but it just, it was sort of like,
[03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:02.520]   the question I've been asking myself a lot
[03:22:02.520 --> 03:22:03.680]   over the last few years is,
[03:22:03.680 --> 03:22:05.080]   who are the adults in the room?
[03:22:05.080 --> 03:22:08.320]   Who's actually regulating all this stuff that's happening?
[03:22:08.320 --> 03:22:09.480]   Everyone's in disagreement.
[03:22:09.480 --> 03:22:13.360]   People are misbehaving in the kind of worst of ways
[03:22:13.360 --> 03:22:18.240]   by not treating each other with respect.
[03:22:18.240 --> 03:22:20.080]   Occasionally, you'd see a discourse
[03:22:20.080 --> 03:22:22.560]   that felt meaningful and structured
[03:22:22.560 --> 03:22:25.760]   or explorative in the real sense,
[03:22:25.760 --> 03:22:26.840]   like people were there to learn.
[03:22:26.840 --> 03:22:29.520]   I think that's been one of the successes of your work
[03:22:29.520 --> 03:22:30.760]   and of Rogan's work.
[03:22:30.760 --> 03:22:32.920]   And I like to think, you know, my podcast as well,
[03:22:32.920 --> 03:22:35.080]   Lex Friedman, certainly, and others, right?
[03:22:35.080 --> 03:22:37.620]   Sometimes people use comedy,
[03:22:37.620 --> 03:22:40.280]   sometimes people use neuroscience as a pro,
[03:22:40.280 --> 03:22:41.680]   but in any case.
[03:22:41.680 --> 03:22:44.640]   But, you know, I've been concerned
[03:22:44.640 --> 03:22:49.640]   that there isn't this kind of like enjoyment of discourse
[03:22:49.640 --> 03:22:52.040]   between people that disagree
[03:22:52.040 --> 03:22:54.120]   in a way that includes forgiveness
[03:22:54.120 --> 03:22:56.440]   or like, "Oh, you got, like, good one, like, you got me."
[03:22:56.440 --> 03:23:00.720]   Or, you know, and it seems like it's degenerated
[03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:03.040]   into things that are so nasty.
[03:23:03.040 --> 03:23:05.160]   And it's sort of like people are entering the game,
[03:23:05.160 --> 03:23:06.600]   if you could even call it that,
[03:23:06.600 --> 03:23:08.720]   with a refusal to shift.
[03:23:08.720 --> 03:23:11.060]   Like, that's not a debate.
[03:23:11.060 --> 03:23:11.900]   - That's what happens.
[03:23:11.900 --> 03:23:12.720]   - There's nothing playful about it.
[03:23:12.720 --> 03:23:14.480]   Like, you have to be willing to have a winner and a loser,
[03:23:14.480 --> 03:23:16.460]   and you have to be willing to be either one
[03:23:16.460 --> 03:23:21.080]   if you're going to engage in real discourse, in real play.
[03:23:21.080 --> 03:23:25.240]   And to me, it's like, okay,
[03:23:25.240 --> 03:23:27.720]   I can manage seeing all that or participate
[03:23:27.720 --> 03:23:29.280]   or not participate to the extent that I want,
[03:23:29.280 --> 03:23:31.940]   but for young people, it's gotta be really discouraging.
[03:23:31.940 --> 03:23:35.360]   It's like you either dunk on somebody or get dunked on.
[03:23:35.360 --> 03:23:38.600]   - You know, I guess the optimistic riposte to that
[03:23:38.600 --> 03:23:41.840]   would be the fact that the people that you're pointing to,
[03:23:41.840 --> 03:23:44.560]   like Rogan, who is a comedian,
[03:23:44.560 --> 03:23:47.120]   like many of the people who've become
[03:23:47.120 --> 03:23:49.360]   extremely successful as podcasters,
[03:23:49.360 --> 03:23:53.120]   Constantine Kisson, Russell Brand, Dave Rubin,
[03:23:53.960 --> 03:23:58.960]   um, Crowder, Steven Crowder, Theo Vaughn,
[03:23:58.960 --> 03:24:01.160]   that's a lot of comedians.
[03:24:01.160 --> 03:24:04.040]   So there's a lot of play in the alternative media,
[03:24:04.040 --> 03:24:06.800]   and a lot of young people are being informed
[03:24:06.800 --> 03:24:08.220]   by the alternative media.
[03:24:08.220 --> 03:24:11.940]   So I think there's genuine room for optimism there.
[03:24:11.940 --> 03:24:18.100]   And there's plenty of play in those podcasts.
[03:24:18.100 --> 03:24:23.100]   Now, a group of us, eight years ago,
[03:24:23.100 --> 03:24:24.900]   seven years ago, put out an offer
[03:24:24.900 --> 03:24:29.900]   to the Democratic Powers That Be
[03:24:29.900 --> 03:24:33.920]   to invite the Democrats to come and talk to us.
[03:24:33.920 --> 03:24:36.380]   Rubin was part of that, Rogan was part of that,
[03:24:36.380 --> 03:24:39.180]   if I remember correctly, I'm quite certain of it.
[03:24:39.180 --> 03:24:42.300]   I was part of that, Shapiro was part of that.
[03:24:42.300 --> 03:24:44.040]   This was a genuine invitation,
[03:24:44.040 --> 03:24:48.180]   which was extended many times in serious ways
[03:24:48.180 --> 03:24:50.420]   by people who are very well-connected
[03:24:50.420 --> 03:24:52.260]   among the Democratic elite.
[03:24:52.260 --> 03:24:54.660]   And that came to nothing.
[03:24:54.660 --> 03:24:55.780]   - They wanted no part of it.
[03:24:55.780 --> 03:24:58.140]   - Nope, they'd speak to me, for example, privately,
[03:24:58.140 --> 03:25:02.740]   never publicly, virtually never, almost without exception.
[03:25:02.740 --> 03:25:05.180]   All the while, the alternative media
[03:25:05.180 --> 03:25:06.460]   was gaining more and more power.
[03:25:06.460 --> 03:25:10.740]   All the while, we were telling them, this isn't optional.
[03:25:10.740 --> 03:25:14.940]   Your legacy media foothold is dying, wake up.
[03:25:14.940 --> 03:25:16.820]   Well, Rogan, for example, you could imagine
[03:25:16.820 --> 03:25:18.380]   that he would be on board with such a thing,
[03:25:18.380 --> 03:25:23.380]   because he's not precisely your stereotypical Republican.
[03:25:23.380 --> 03:25:25.180]   - No, not at all.
[03:25:25.180 --> 03:25:26.460]   - Right.
[03:25:26.460 --> 03:25:27.740]   - People will call him that.
[03:25:27.740 --> 03:25:30.500]   They try and, you know, manosphere, bro, whatever.
[03:25:30.500 --> 03:25:33.700]   It doesn't, the reality falls so far from that.
[03:25:33.700 --> 03:25:36.180]   - Yeah, it's just not true at all.
[03:25:36.180 --> 03:25:37.020]   - That's not true.
[03:25:37.020 --> 03:25:39.740]   - Yeah, so there is plenty of play,
[03:25:39.740 --> 03:25:42.780]   and so I think we can be positive about that.
[03:25:42.780 --> 03:25:44.200]   And I think young people, too,
[03:25:44.200 --> 03:25:46.840]   have seen how successful that could be.
[03:25:46.840 --> 03:25:51.260]   I mean, Rogan and his coterie, let's say,
[03:25:51.260 --> 03:25:53.200]   wiped out the legacy media.
[03:25:53.200 --> 03:25:57.720]   Well, so you can see what the spirit of playful adventure
[03:25:57.720 --> 03:25:59.540]   can do in a very short period of time.
[03:25:59.540 --> 03:26:01.460]   Now, there's technological reasons for that, too,
[03:26:01.460 --> 03:26:05.260]   but technological reasons are not.
[03:26:05.260 --> 03:26:07.840]   It's still a stunning phenomenon
[03:26:07.840 --> 03:26:09.420]   and a stunning accomplishment,
[03:26:09.420 --> 03:26:11.660]   and a very positive one as far as I'm concerned,
[03:26:11.660 --> 03:26:13.480]   and hopefully it will continue.
[03:26:13.480 --> 03:26:16.260]   - Yeah, the power pendulum has definitely swung.
[03:26:16.260 --> 03:26:17.100]   - Yeah.
[03:26:17.100 --> 03:26:17.920]   - In a different direction.
[03:26:17.920 --> 03:26:20.600]   - Yeah, well, that became stark, starkly obvious
[03:26:20.600 --> 03:26:24.160]   when Rogan interviewed Trump.
[03:26:24.160 --> 03:26:27.360]   That was the death knell of the legacy media.
[03:26:27.360 --> 03:26:28.920]   - It certainly elevated podcasts
[03:26:28.920 --> 03:26:31.440]   and their impact and significance across the board.
[03:26:31.440 --> 03:26:33.640]   - Well, I think it demonstrated the fact
[03:26:33.640 --> 03:26:35.700]   that they had been elevated, right?
[03:26:35.700 --> 03:26:39.680]   It was evidence of that that was so conclusive
[03:26:39.680 --> 03:26:43.760]   that there was no longer any way of questioning it.
[03:26:43.760 --> 03:26:46.980]   Even the CNN pundits and so forth,
[03:26:46.980 --> 03:26:50.100]   who were very resistant to that as a hypothesis,
[03:26:50.100 --> 03:26:53.020]   changed their tune very rapidly.
[03:26:53.020 --> 03:26:54.140]   - Well, and it was interesting
[03:26:54.140 --> 03:26:58.300]   because Rogan's conversation with Trump was a serious one.
[03:26:58.300 --> 03:26:59.920]   Theo's conversation with Trump
[03:26:59.920 --> 03:27:03.260]   was a mixture of serious and less serious.
[03:27:03.260 --> 03:27:07.460]   And I mean, I couldn't help but smile big
[03:27:07.460 --> 03:27:10.400]   when at the inauguration,
[03:27:10.400 --> 03:27:12.760]   the thanks went out to a number of people,
[03:27:12.760 --> 03:27:13.940]   including Theo Vaughn.
[03:27:13.940 --> 03:27:14.780]   I mean, if you think about this.
[03:27:14.780 --> 03:27:16.980]   - I know, I know, it's so funny.
[03:27:16.980 --> 03:27:18.580]   Good for Theo, it's so funny.
[03:27:18.580 --> 03:27:19.420]   - Yeah, I'm yet to meet him.
[03:27:19.420 --> 03:27:20.260]   I hear he's a very nice guy.
[03:27:20.260 --> 03:27:21.080]   - Oh, I really like Theo.
[03:27:21.080 --> 03:27:22.880]   Theo's so great because Theo is,
[03:27:22.880 --> 03:27:29.180]   like he's backwoods hip to the core, right?
[03:27:29.180 --> 03:27:30.620]   Seriously.
[03:27:30.620 --> 03:27:33.500]   Underclass background, and it's real.
[03:27:33.500 --> 03:27:36.060]   And he's so bloody smart.
[03:27:36.060 --> 03:27:37.860]   And so it's such a fun combination
[03:27:37.860 --> 03:27:39.320]   because he's got this,
[03:27:39.320 --> 03:27:41.540]   it's pretty easy if you're elitist
[03:27:41.540 --> 03:27:46.540]   to be derisive about Theo and his backwoodsy stick.
[03:27:46.540 --> 03:27:53.920]   But man, there's a first rate mind lurking behind that.
[03:27:53.920 --> 03:27:59.080]   It's not a persona 'cause it's actually him too.
[03:27:59.080 --> 03:28:00.900]   I can relate to that to a large degree
[03:28:00.900 --> 03:28:03.800]   because I came from a very small town,
[03:28:03.800 --> 03:28:05.780]   way the hell out in the middle of nowhere.
[03:28:05.780 --> 03:28:08.760]   And so I have plenty in common with Theo.
[03:28:08.760 --> 03:28:10.940]   But it's very funny to watch.
[03:28:10.940 --> 03:28:12.940]   It's very funny to see him do this successfully.
[03:28:12.940 --> 03:28:16.640]   It's ridiculously and preposterously comical
[03:28:16.640 --> 03:28:18.140]   that he got to sit down with Trump.
[03:28:18.140 --> 03:28:21.180]   I mean, I just thought that was, that's so funny.
[03:28:21.180 --> 03:28:23.540]   And that it was successful and playful.
[03:28:23.540 --> 03:28:24.860]   You know, that's great.
[03:28:24.860 --> 03:28:26.220]   And there's plenty of play
[03:28:26.220 --> 03:28:29.380]   in the Republican renaissance at the moment,
[03:28:29.380 --> 03:28:30.320]   whatever that is.
[03:28:30.320 --> 03:28:32.380]   I mean, Republican, to call it that,
[03:28:32.380 --> 03:28:34.760]   is like that's whatever the hell's happening.
[03:28:34.760 --> 03:28:36.780]   It's not conceptualizable
[03:28:36.780 --> 03:28:40.300]   in terms of our normal political dichotomy, right?
[03:28:40.300 --> 03:28:42.060]   I mean, we're in uncharted water.
[03:28:42.060 --> 03:28:45.540]   Now, hopefully, this is why I hope
[03:28:45.540 --> 03:28:47.380]   the Democrats get their act together
[03:28:47.380 --> 03:28:52.380]   'cause every administration needs an opposition.
[03:28:52.380 --> 03:28:55.800]   And if the Democrats continue with this woke idiocy,
[03:28:55.800 --> 03:28:57.300]   they're not going to be able to serve
[03:28:57.300 --> 03:28:59.940]   as the proper corrective to the excesses
[03:28:59.940 --> 03:29:02.820]   that will definitely emerge in the Trump administration,
[03:29:02.820 --> 03:29:05.500]   especially if they face no credible opposition.
[03:29:05.500 --> 03:29:07.140]   'Cause that always happens.
[03:29:07.140 --> 03:29:10.060]   - Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.
[03:29:10.060 --> 03:29:13.060]   Before we started, we were touching on this a little bit.
[03:29:13.060 --> 03:29:14.940]   And you said something,
[03:29:14.940 --> 03:29:18.000]   which was that you're hoping for a really formidable,
[03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:22.180]   strong Democratic Party to counter the Republican Party.
[03:29:22.180 --> 03:29:23.780]   And you are, and you're saying it again now,
[03:29:23.780 --> 03:29:27.080]   you're concerned that if there isn't one,
[03:29:27.080 --> 03:29:29.300]   that power- - Corrupts.
[03:29:29.300 --> 03:29:30.540]   - Might run amok.
[03:29:30.540 --> 03:29:31.380]   - Oh, yes.
[03:29:31.380 --> 03:29:32.200]   Well, of course it will.
[03:29:32.200 --> 03:29:33.140]   It always does.
[03:29:33.140 --> 03:29:35.660]   You know, and that the Republicans themselves,
[03:29:35.660 --> 03:29:37.380]   who might wish well,
[03:29:37.380 --> 03:29:39.020]   this remarkable group of people
[03:29:39.020 --> 03:29:40.420]   that's aggregated around Trump,
[03:29:40.420 --> 03:29:42.300]   it's like they should hope for themselves
[03:29:42.300 --> 03:29:44.420]   that they have an effective opposition
[03:29:44.420 --> 03:29:47.780]   because someone's gotta be telling you where you're stupid.
[03:29:47.780 --> 03:29:49.300]   And if the Democrats,
[03:29:49.300 --> 03:29:52.340]   so this is another public invitation to the Democrats,
[03:29:52.340 --> 03:29:56.320]   which is like, must be the 50th one that I've issued.
[03:29:56.320 --> 03:29:58.700]   If you have something to say, you know,
[03:29:58.700 --> 03:30:00.060]   I'd be happy to talk.
[03:30:00.060 --> 03:30:01.780]   And so would many people
[03:30:01.780 --> 03:30:04.300]   who've expressed similar sentiment to me
[03:30:04.300 --> 03:30:06.300]   in the alternative media world.
[03:30:06.300 --> 03:30:08.140]   And that offer has been on the table
[03:30:08.140 --> 03:30:10.780]   for years.
[03:30:10.780 --> 03:30:12.180]   So I hope that,
[03:30:12.180 --> 03:30:16.460]   I'm afraid that all the people with any real courage
[03:30:16.460 --> 03:30:17.300]   or virtually all of them
[03:30:17.300 --> 03:30:19.620]   will be chased out of the Democratic Party.
[03:30:19.620 --> 03:30:21.060]   They're all afraid of being canceled,
[03:30:21.060 --> 03:30:23.500]   which is why they wouldn't appear on my podcast
[03:30:23.500 --> 03:30:24.500]   to begin with.
[03:30:24.500 --> 03:30:27.300]   It's like, why does Peterson always interview conservatives?
[03:30:27.300 --> 03:30:31.580]   It's like, well, how about because they'll talk to me?
[03:30:31.580 --> 03:30:33.420]   You know, there's a simple explanation
[03:30:33.420 --> 03:30:35.820]   and definitely a true one.
[03:30:35.820 --> 03:30:37.520]   So maybe that can shift
[03:30:37.520 --> 03:30:39.820]   and there's gotta be somebody in the Democrats
[03:30:39.820 --> 03:30:43.820]   who's got enough courage to forge a new direction.
[03:30:43.820 --> 03:30:45.300]   And if they wanna continue
[03:30:45.300 --> 03:30:48.460]   with this same old pattern of woke idiocy,
[03:30:48.460 --> 03:30:49.860]   well, go right ahead.
[03:30:49.860 --> 03:30:51.060]   It's not gonna work.
[03:30:51.060 --> 03:30:53.160]   The tide's already turned in that regard.
[03:30:53.160 --> 03:30:57.480]   - I think that judging from some of the article titles
[03:30:57.480 --> 03:31:01.120]   that I've seen at New York Times and other venues,
[03:31:01.120 --> 03:31:05.300]   it seems like there might be some consideration about this.
[03:31:05.300 --> 03:31:06.540]   They're talking about a restructuring
[03:31:06.540 --> 03:31:07.880]   of the Democratic Party.
[03:31:07.880 --> 03:31:08.900]   Who's going to lead?
[03:31:08.900 --> 03:31:10.980]   Who's going to be their Joe Rogan?
[03:31:10.980 --> 03:31:12.940]   Which is, by the way, a silly question.
[03:31:12.940 --> 03:31:14.420]   That's just the silliest question.
[03:31:14.420 --> 03:31:18.080]   He is, as we say in science, he's N of one.
[03:31:18.080 --> 03:31:19.800]   Don't even try.
[03:31:19.800 --> 03:31:22.100]   The whole point is to create.
[03:31:22.100 --> 03:31:22.940]   Well, why would you?
[03:31:22.940 --> 03:31:24.460]   - You also can't.
[03:31:24.460 --> 03:31:25.300]   - Yeah, right.
[03:31:25.300 --> 03:31:26.120]   It's impossible.
[03:31:26.120 --> 03:31:27.620]   - Joe didn't emerge by accident.
[03:31:27.620 --> 03:31:30.140]   Joe is very, very, very smart.
[03:31:30.140 --> 03:31:31.060]   Very.
[03:31:31.060 --> 03:31:33.500]   And if you think, and it's what?
[03:31:33.500 --> 03:31:34.660]   It's like, Joe built this?
[03:31:34.660 --> 03:31:36.380]   It's like, not the way
[03:31:36.380 --> 03:31:39.540]   that a political party would build it.
[03:31:39.540 --> 03:31:41.020]   First of all, he didn't build it.
[03:31:41.020 --> 03:31:42.580]   Not that way.
[03:31:42.580 --> 03:31:45.100]   Not through a priori planning
[03:31:45.100 --> 03:31:47.820]   so that the Democrats could have a voice.
[03:31:47.820 --> 03:31:49.280]   - It's just him being him.
[03:31:49.280 --> 03:31:50.120]   - Yes, exactly.
[03:31:50.120 --> 03:31:53.660]   - Yeah, and someone who is a self-declared Democrat
[03:31:53.660 --> 03:31:55.740]   will do that as well, but not by trying to be him.
[03:31:55.740 --> 03:31:56.740]   That's just not going to happen.
[03:31:56.740 --> 03:32:00.600]   - No, they'll do that by trying to figure out
[03:32:00.600 --> 03:32:02.620]   what the opposition to this new,
[03:32:02.620 --> 03:32:05.380]   peculiar band of Republicans should be,
[03:32:05.380 --> 03:32:07.380]   and what sort of vision could be put forward
[03:32:07.380 --> 03:32:08.900]   that would be attractive.
[03:32:08.900 --> 03:32:11.060]   You know, I read today some Democrat claiming
[03:32:11.060 --> 03:32:14.380]   that the Democrats are the true voice of the working class.
[03:32:14.380 --> 03:32:16.260]   It's like, I don't think so.
[03:32:16.260 --> 03:32:18.740]   I think that ship has sailed,
[03:32:18.740 --> 03:32:21.300]   and maybe the Democrats should be the true voice
[03:32:21.300 --> 03:32:24.820]   of the working class, but they're certainly not.
[03:32:24.820 --> 03:32:27.060]   And in principle, that would mean
[03:32:27.060 --> 03:32:29.060]   that there's an opportunity there
[03:32:29.060 --> 03:32:31.860]   on the Democrat side to forge a new path.
[03:32:31.860 --> 03:32:34.100]   I mean, Clinton managed that in the '90s.
[03:32:34.100 --> 03:32:35.420]   This has happened many times.
[03:32:35.420 --> 03:32:36.820]   It could happen again.
[03:32:36.820 --> 03:32:39.860]   But there's a lot of learning
[03:32:39.860 --> 03:32:42.540]   that's going to have to take place before that happens.
[03:32:42.540 --> 03:32:44.900]   So certainly learning about
[03:32:44.900 --> 03:32:47.260]   this new alternative media environment.
[03:32:47.260 --> 03:32:48.780]   If you can't sit down for three hours
[03:32:48.780 --> 03:32:50.960]   and say what you actually think,
[03:32:50.960 --> 03:32:54.220]   actually what you think, right,
[03:32:54.220 --> 03:32:56.940]   regardless of what might do to your reputation,
[03:32:56.940 --> 03:32:58.980]   let's say, you're not going to be successful
[03:32:58.980 --> 03:33:00.500]   in the podcast world.
[03:33:00.500 --> 03:33:01.620]   - Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[03:33:01.620 --> 03:33:02.980]   Podcasting is real.
[03:33:02.980 --> 03:33:04.600]   Even for, I'll just say,
[03:33:04.600 --> 03:33:07.100]   because perhaps it's of interest
[03:33:07.100 --> 03:33:08.540]   or maybe even actionable for people.
[03:33:08.540 --> 03:33:12.660]   I mean, I get a little frightened every podcast.
[03:33:12.660 --> 03:33:14.060]   Certainly if I'm going to talk about
[03:33:14.060 --> 03:33:15.980]   like I'm forming this relationship to prayer
[03:33:15.980 --> 03:33:17.700]   or I'm exploring a, I mean,
[03:33:17.700 --> 03:33:19.820]   I'll talk about circuits in the brain all day long
[03:33:19.820 --> 03:33:22.060]   with no fear whatsoever.
[03:33:22.060 --> 03:33:23.020]   That's my wheelhouse.
[03:33:23.020 --> 03:33:24.980]   But anything that's new,
[03:33:24.980 --> 03:33:29.660]   which is a real exploration and evolution of where I'm at,
[03:33:29.660 --> 03:33:30.980]   of course is going to evoke fear.
[03:33:30.980 --> 03:33:33.780]   I also know that's where the growth is.
[03:33:33.780 --> 03:33:34.960]   I would hate for this podcast
[03:33:34.960 --> 03:33:38.060]   to look the way it did on episode one now.
[03:33:38.060 --> 03:33:41.740]   And clearly this conversation is a new direction
[03:33:41.740 --> 03:33:44.220]   that I've not taken before in this podcast,
[03:33:44.220 --> 03:33:45.700]   but I'm delighted that it's happening.
[03:33:45.700 --> 03:33:47.020]   I want to say that.
[03:33:47.020 --> 03:33:51.300]   And I think that some level of fear and anxiety
[03:33:51.300 --> 03:33:54.340]   about the unknown is absolutely required.
[03:33:54.340 --> 03:33:56.820]   And I think that that's something that hopefully any,
[03:33:56.820 --> 03:33:59.100]   especially young people listening need to know.
[03:33:59.100 --> 03:34:01.620]   You're not supposed to perform well at the outset.
[03:34:01.620 --> 03:34:03.180]   Like in anything.
[03:34:03.180 --> 03:34:04.020]   You're not. - Well, you can't.
[03:34:04.020 --> 03:34:05.660]   That's why Jung said the fool
[03:34:05.660 --> 03:34:07.380]   is the precursor to the redeemer.
[03:34:07.380 --> 03:34:11.460]   You have to accept the role of fool voluntarily
[03:34:11.460 --> 03:34:13.220]   before you can improve.
[03:34:13.220 --> 03:34:14.620]   Of course, when you start something new,
[03:34:14.620 --> 03:34:16.000]   you're going to be an idiot.
[03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:17.860]   Like, what do you know?
[03:34:17.860 --> 03:34:21.580]   So that's the price of entry is to be a fool.
[03:34:21.580 --> 03:34:23.100]   Well, you can be a voluntary fool.
[03:34:23.100 --> 03:34:23.980]   And then you can,
[03:34:23.980 --> 03:34:26.300]   then you have a bit of a sense of humor about yourself.
[03:34:26.300 --> 03:34:27.940]   And that takes the sting out of it.
[03:34:27.940 --> 03:34:30.540]   And maybe even makes you an attractive character
[03:34:30.540 --> 03:34:31.580]   despite your ignorance.
[03:34:31.580 --> 03:34:35.180]   People will make tremendous allowances
[03:34:35.180 --> 03:34:38.780]   for ignorance that's voluntarily admitted to.
[03:34:38.780 --> 03:34:40.340]   - I've certainly made mistakes publicly,
[03:34:40.340 --> 03:34:43.260]   apologized for the ones that I felt I should apologize for.
[03:34:43.260 --> 03:34:46.420]   There's a slip of the tongue and make it, said something,
[03:34:46.420 --> 03:34:47.340]   went back and correct.
[03:34:47.340 --> 03:34:48.160]   It was embarrassing,
[03:34:48.160 --> 03:34:51.300]   but the ability to laugh at oneself
[03:34:51.300 --> 03:34:53.580]   is tremendously powerful.
[03:34:53.580 --> 03:34:54.500]   Genuinely laugh.
[03:34:54.500 --> 03:34:56.500]   It's just thinking like, oh God, where was I thinking?
[03:34:56.500 --> 03:34:58.820]   I understand this, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:34:58.820 --> 03:35:02.780]   You know, sometimes we err, you know.
[03:35:02.780 --> 03:35:04.620]   I have a couple of questions about you.
[03:35:04.620 --> 03:35:05.740]   - Uh-oh.
[03:35:05.740 --> 03:35:07.960]   - I know you're the clinician,
[03:35:07.960 --> 03:35:10.100]   but I'm not trying to play that role.
[03:35:10.100 --> 03:35:13.660]   When you wake up in the morning,
[03:35:13.660 --> 03:35:16.100]   is your mind in a good place typically?
[03:35:16.100 --> 03:35:17.180]   Or are you tormented?
[03:35:17.180 --> 03:35:22.180]   Or are you, where does your mind land most mornings?
[03:35:22.180 --> 03:35:23.040]   First thing.
[03:35:24.860 --> 03:35:29.860]   - Well, I've suffered from a proclivity towards depression
[03:35:29.860 --> 03:35:32.840]   my whole life, I would say.
[03:35:32.840 --> 03:35:36.660]   And I would say the roughest part of the day for me
[03:35:36.660 --> 03:35:39.880]   is morning, although it's way better than it once was.
[03:35:39.880 --> 03:35:44.620]   So when I get up, I have a shower and make my bed
[03:35:44.620 --> 03:35:45.580]   and do something useful.
[03:35:45.580 --> 03:35:49.200]   And then I'm pretty much, I'm on my way.
[03:35:49.200 --> 03:35:51.980]   - You're into your tasks into the day.
[03:35:51.980 --> 03:35:54.380]   - And I still have quite a lot of pain
[03:35:54.380 --> 03:35:56.660]   from whatever happened to me a couple of years ago.
[03:35:56.660 --> 03:35:57.660]   And so that's annoying.
[03:35:57.660 --> 03:35:58.500]   - Physical pain.
[03:35:58.500 --> 03:36:00.260]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:36:00.260 --> 03:36:05.260]   But psychologically, my life is ridiculously,
[03:36:05.260 --> 03:36:09.020]   it's absurdly interesting.
[03:36:09.020 --> 03:36:13.800]   It's crazily and absurdly interesting all the time.
[03:36:13.800 --> 03:36:18.580]   And so anyone with any sense would be like open-mouthed
[03:36:18.580 --> 03:36:21.220]   in amazement and gratitude for that.
[03:36:21.220 --> 03:36:22.580]   It's preposterous.
[03:36:23.500 --> 03:36:26.840]   And I have this tour that's going,
[03:36:26.840 --> 03:36:29.780]   well, it's been going for like six years, really.
[03:36:29.780 --> 03:36:30.620]   And it continues.
[03:36:30.620 --> 03:36:32.380]   - Your tour schedule is superhuman.
[03:36:32.380 --> 03:36:34.180]   I have to say, having done some live shows,
[03:36:34.180 --> 03:36:35.460]   I mean, what you do with tours,
[03:36:35.460 --> 03:36:36.500]   and I've been to one of your shows.
[03:36:36.500 --> 03:36:38.300]   I highly recommend people attend.
[03:36:38.300 --> 03:36:39.540]   It was spectacular.
[03:36:39.540 --> 03:36:40.760]   I don't wanna give too much away,
[03:36:40.760 --> 03:36:43.580]   but it's not planned in the sense
[03:36:43.580 --> 03:36:44.760]   that there's a script or something.
[03:36:44.760 --> 03:36:47.020]   It's very open and, but--
[03:36:47.020 --> 03:36:47.920]   - It's a quest.
[03:36:47.920 --> 03:36:48.760]   - It's a quest.
[03:36:48.760 --> 03:36:50.100]   - An intellectual quest, right?
[03:36:50.100 --> 03:36:50.940]   - It's a real experience.
[03:36:50.940 --> 03:36:52.500]   And men, wear your jacket and tie
[03:36:52.500 --> 03:36:54.140]   because everyone else there is gonna be wearing a jacket,
[03:36:54.140 --> 03:36:54.980]   at least a jacket.
[03:36:54.980 --> 03:36:57.260]   - Dress up, look respectable.
[03:36:57.260 --> 03:36:59.660]   Yeah, so my wife and I are touring
[03:36:59.660 --> 03:37:02.440]   from January through June.
[03:37:02.440 --> 03:37:05.540]   And much of that's in the United States.
[03:37:05.540 --> 03:37:07.460]   And then two months in Europe.
[03:37:07.460 --> 03:37:10.700]   And so that's great because Europe is in trouble.
[03:37:10.700 --> 03:37:14.100]   And going there to speak is a privilege and an honor.
[03:37:14.100 --> 03:37:17.060]   And so that's ridiculously exciting.
[03:37:17.060 --> 03:37:19.100]   And people can find more out about the tour
[03:37:19.100 --> 03:37:22.460]   at jordanbpeterson.com, the dates and so forth.
[03:37:22.460 --> 03:37:23.760]   They're all listed there.
[03:37:23.760 --> 03:37:27.980]   We launched Peterson Academy, where we want you to teach.
[03:37:27.980 --> 03:37:31.260]   And that's going spectacularly well.
[03:37:31.260 --> 03:37:33.100]   - This is a place where people can hear lectures
[03:37:33.100 --> 03:37:34.060]   in a given domain?
[03:37:34.060 --> 03:37:35.420]   - Yep, yep, yep.
[03:37:35.420 --> 03:37:39.140]   We have 35 lectures online already.
[03:37:39.140 --> 03:37:43.260]   Each of them is sequenced over six to eight hours,
[03:37:43.260 --> 03:37:44.900]   which compacts, I would say,
[03:37:44.900 --> 03:37:46.820]   the equivalent of a full university course
[03:37:46.820 --> 03:37:48.660]   into that span of time.
[03:37:48.660 --> 03:37:50.140]   We're pursuing accreditation,
[03:37:50.140 --> 03:37:52.300]   which I think is a high probability
[03:37:52.300 --> 03:37:55.800]   in the relatively not too distant future.
[03:37:55.800 --> 03:37:57.420]   So that's ridiculously exciting
[03:37:57.420 --> 03:37:59.700]   because we can take the best lectures in the world
[03:37:59.700 --> 03:38:02.380]   and we can make them available to everyone.
[03:38:02.380 --> 03:38:04.400]   And we built a social media element into it.
[03:38:04.400 --> 03:38:07.180]   We took the best of the social media networks.
[03:38:07.180 --> 03:38:09.780]   And people are using it like mad.
[03:38:09.780 --> 03:38:12.880]   And it's 100% positive.
[03:38:12.880 --> 03:38:15.180]   It's philosophically oriented.
[03:38:15.180 --> 03:38:16.940]   It's mutually encouraging.
[03:38:16.940 --> 03:38:19.980]   We threw four people off the platform out of 40,000.
[03:38:19.980 --> 03:38:22.420]   Well, three, 'cause we put one guy on probation
[03:38:22.420 --> 03:38:24.300]   'cause he said he'd improve.
[03:38:24.300 --> 03:38:26.820]   And we established a positive culture.
[03:38:26.820 --> 03:38:29.540]   There's no bots, there's no trolls.
[03:38:29.540 --> 03:38:32.500]   No one's playing games and we watch.
[03:38:32.500 --> 03:38:35.380]   And now, you know, the community has settled into a,
[03:38:35.380 --> 03:38:36.780]   it's got an ethos already.
[03:38:36.780 --> 03:38:38.580]   And I think that'll be self-sustaining.
[03:38:38.580 --> 03:38:40.740]   - So people are there to learn.
[03:38:40.740 --> 03:38:42.340]   - And to support each other learning.
[03:38:42.340 --> 03:38:43.180]   - Got it.
[03:38:43.180 --> 03:38:44.740]   - It launched out of the gate
[03:38:44.740 --> 03:38:46.500]   better than we thought it would,
[03:38:46.500 --> 03:38:47.860]   even though we were optimistic.
[03:38:47.860 --> 03:38:51.420]   And I would say the quality of what we're offering exceeded,
[03:38:51.420 --> 03:38:53.380]   it certainly exceeded my expectations.
[03:38:53.380 --> 03:38:56.980]   It's, well, we showed Michael Malice.
[03:38:56.980 --> 03:39:01.020]   Michael Malice did a course for us on totalitarianism.
[03:39:01.020 --> 03:39:02.620]   And he takes that rather personally,
[03:39:02.620 --> 03:39:04.460]   given his family background.
[03:39:04.460 --> 03:39:08.300]   And he said that the trailer brought him to tears.
[03:39:08.300 --> 03:39:11.700]   And that's my, now I can be easily brought to tears.
[03:39:11.700 --> 03:39:12.740]   So I don't know if I'm the best.
[03:39:12.740 --> 03:39:14.620]   - Same, like around certain topics.
[03:39:14.620 --> 03:39:15.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:39:15.460 --> 03:39:16.700]   - I've cried a few times on this podcast this year
[03:39:16.700 --> 03:39:17.540]   and a few others.
[03:39:17.540 --> 03:39:20.980]   So that was a vulnerability I'd never expected, but.
[03:39:20.980 --> 03:39:22.980]   - Yeah, well, it's good to know I'm not alone in that.
[03:39:22.980 --> 03:39:23.820]   - You're not alone.
[03:39:23.820 --> 03:39:25.900]   - I'm less susceptible now that I'm more healthy.
[03:39:25.900 --> 03:39:29.060]   But I feel the same way about what we're producing,
[03:39:29.060 --> 03:39:32.020]   because it's exactly, if you were a professor
[03:39:32.020 --> 03:39:34.900]   and you wanted the best possible courses
[03:39:34.900 --> 03:39:37.480]   to be available to people,
[03:39:37.480 --> 03:39:41.020]   and you saw these, you'd think, target, hit.
[03:39:41.020 --> 03:39:43.540]   And that's ridiculously fun.
[03:39:43.540 --> 03:39:47.100]   And so, and I have a great relationship
[03:39:47.100 --> 03:39:48.980]   with my wife and my kids.
[03:39:48.980 --> 03:39:50.100]   - You have some grandkids now too.
[03:39:50.100 --> 03:39:52.220]   - I do, and two more on the way.
[03:39:52.220 --> 03:39:53.060]   - Wow, congratulations.
[03:39:53.060 --> 03:39:57.500]   - And so, you know, and I have an endless field
[03:39:57.500 --> 03:40:00.320]   of stellar opportunity in front of me.
[03:40:00.320 --> 03:40:04.700]   So hopefully I have enough sense to appreciate that.
[03:40:04.700 --> 03:40:07.180]   And I hope, and I do, I do appreciate it.
[03:40:07.180 --> 03:40:09.980]   And I know it's unlikely, so.
[03:40:09.980 --> 03:40:13.560]   - A long way from posting lectures on YouTube,
[03:40:13.560 --> 03:40:17.400]   which is where most people originally found you,
[03:40:17.400 --> 03:40:18.240]   if they were listening about that.
[03:40:18.240 --> 03:40:19.060]   - Yeah.
[03:40:19.060 --> 03:40:19.900]   - That's certainly how I learned about you.
[03:40:19.900 --> 03:40:22.020]   I thought this guy's talking about really interesting things
[03:40:22.020 --> 03:40:23.220]   in the fields of psychology.
[03:40:23.220 --> 03:40:24.940]   He knows who Jock Panksepp is.
[03:40:24.940 --> 03:40:27.620]   And he's posted it on YouTube.
[03:40:27.620 --> 03:40:29.940]   Can I ask what inspired that move?
[03:40:29.940 --> 03:40:34.100]   Was that from conscious, was that calling or conscience?
[03:40:34.100 --> 03:40:36.260]   Or both?
[03:40:36.260 --> 03:40:38.760]   - It was probably mostly calling,
[03:40:38.760 --> 03:40:41.860]   because the fundamental motivation was,
[03:40:41.860 --> 03:40:45.420]   and I think it is my fundamental motivation, is curiosity.
[03:40:45.420 --> 03:40:48.700]   You know, I watched YouTube and I thought,
[03:40:48.700 --> 03:40:51.700]   hmm, what the hell is this?
[03:40:51.700 --> 03:40:58.860]   Video on demand worldwide, what does that mean?
[03:40:58.860 --> 03:41:03.180]   It means the spoken word is now as permanent
[03:41:03.180 --> 03:41:05.820]   as the written word and more easily disseminated.
[03:41:05.820 --> 03:41:09.680]   I thought, oh, that's a spectacular
[03:41:09.680 --> 03:41:12.240]   and world-altering revolution.
[03:41:12.240 --> 03:41:13.400]   That's what it looks like to me.
[03:41:13.400 --> 03:41:16.000]   This was like in 2010, you know,
[03:41:16.000 --> 03:41:18.820]   when it was mostly cat videos.
[03:41:18.820 --> 03:41:23.080]   I thought, might as well put my videos up there
[03:41:23.080 --> 03:41:24.380]   and see what happens.
[03:41:24.380 --> 03:41:27.960]   And so, see what happens, right?
[03:41:27.960 --> 03:41:29.720]   That's an adventure.
[03:41:29.720 --> 03:41:34.720]   And so, I did that for maybe six years.
[03:41:34.780 --> 03:41:38.460]   Maybe seven years, somewhere between five and seven years
[03:41:38.460 --> 03:41:40.260]   before things exploded around me.
[03:41:40.260 --> 03:41:41.900]   And that was also extremely helpful,
[03:41:41.900 --> 03:41:46.900]   because when I opposed the Trudeau government's attempt
[03:41:46.900 --> 03:41:52.780]   to compel my speech in the form of Bill C-16,
[03:41:52.780 --> 03:41:55.820]   I was immediately pilloried as a, you know,
[03:41:55.820 --> 03:41:59.780]   right-wing Nazi, even though I'd spent my whole career
[03:41:59.780 --> 03:42:02.820]   publicizing the horrors of the Nazi administration
[03:42:02.820 --> 03:42:05.940]   and teaching my students how not to fall prey
[03:42:05.940 --> 03:42:07.560]   to totalitarian temptation.
[03:42:07.560 --> 03:42:10.220]   Like, that was the core of my career.
[03:42:10.220 --> 03:42:15.880]   I had like 200 hours of lectures up on YouTube already.
[03:42:15.880 --> 03:42:18.840]   So, when all that negative attention was drawn to me,
[03:42:18.840 --> 03:42:20.520]   people started looking at the lectures.
[03:42:20.520 --> 03:42:24.640]   And the huge advantage there was that there wasn't a single,
[03:42:24.640 --> 03:42:26.800]   really, there wasn't a single important word
[03:42:26.800 --> 03:42:28.840]   I'd said to students in the last 20 years
[03:42:28.840 --> 03:42:30.800]   that wasn't recorded.
[03:42:30.800 --> 03:42:33.000]   And the people who decided that, you know,
[03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:35.840]   I was a reprehensible character had every opportunity
[03:42:35.840 --> 03:42:38.800]   to go through everything I'd said with a fine-tooth comb,
[03:42:38.800 --> 03:42:41.080]   which you can be absolutely certain they did.
[03:42:41.080 --> 03:42:44.240]   And they couldn't find one thing I ever said
[03:42:44.240 --> 03:42:48.040]   that led any credence whatsoever to their accusations.
[03:42:48.040 --> 03:42:50.360]   And so, that was a breaking point in some ways
[03:42:50.360 --> 03:42:57.560]   for council culture, because there were very forceful
[03:42:59.960 --> 03:43:01.280]   attempts to counsel me.
[03:43:01.280 --> 03:43:03.080]   And so, people went and checked me out,
[03:43:03.080 --> 03:43:08.080]   and they thought, huh, nothing he says falls into alignment
[03:43:08.080 --> 03:43:10.360]   with what he's being accused about.
[03:43:10.360 --> 03:43:16.240]   Well, you know, that, what would you say?
[03:43:16.240 --> 03:43:21.040]   That was part of the dam breaking with regards
[03:43:21.040 --> 03:43:23.100]   to the corruption of the legacy media.
[03:43:23.100 --> 03:43:27.360]   So, not only was what I was accused of a lie,
[03:43:27.360 --> 03:43:30.080]   it was exactly the opposite of the truth,
[03:43:30.080 --> 03:43:32.880]   which is the most profound kind of lie.
[03:43:32.880 --> 03:43:35.460]   So, YouTube helped me out a lot there.
[03:43:35.460 --> 03:43:39.640]   - Well, you've certainly prevailed.
[03:43:39.640 --> 03:43:41.680]   And we're all-- - So far.
[03:43:41.680 --> 03:43:45.160]   - Well, I guess that speaks to what I was going to say,
[03:43:45.160 --> 03:43:47.960]   which is that I want to thank you
[03:43:47.960 --> 03:43:50.840]   for posting those videos on YouTube
[03:43:50.840 --> 03:43:53.640]   and for entering that adventure,
[03:43:53.640 --> 03:43:58.280]   because it certainly was the beginning of a long adventure
[03:43:58.280 --> 03:44:00.160]   that's still happening now,
[03:44:00.160 --> 03:44:04.920]   where you continue to take risks that are healthy risks
[03:44:04.920 --> 03:44:08.880]   in service to trying to understand the truth and share that.
[03:44:08.880 --> 03:44:11.080]   And I must say, never with the stance
[03:44:11.080 --> 03:44:13.920]   that you know absolutely right for everybody,
[03:44:13.920 --> 03:44:17.000]   but certainly where you have felt
[03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:19.880]   you could share useful knowledge at the practical level,
[03:44:19.880 --> 03:44:21.360]   like really how to operationalize,
[03:44:21.360 --> 03:44:24.320]   like clean up your room, right, you know?
[03:44:24.320 --> 03:44:27.660]   Do these things to try and discover your path,
[03:44:27.660 --> 03:44:31.200]   get on your path, set your sights to the right level.
[03:44:31.200 --> 03:44:32.800]   And to make that a daily practice
[03:44:32.800 --> 03:44:37.160]   and a repeated lifelong practice is really spectacular.
[03:44:37.160 --> 03:44:38.960]   And it's obviously inspired millions of people,
[03:44:38.960 --> 03:44:40.040]   including myself.
[03:44:40.040 --> 03:44:43.040]   I'll also say that it's really wonderful
[03:44:43.040 --> 03:44:46.200]   that you are also continuing to do that yourself
[03:44:46.200 --> 03:44:47.800]   and making that visible to people.
[03:44:47.800 --> 03:44:49.160]   Your live events, of course,
[03:44:49.160 --> 03:44:52.560]   are an exploration in the moment where you raise a question
[03:44:52.560 --> 03:44:53.900]   and ask a question and address it.
[03:44:53.900 --> 03:44:55.640]   It's not pre-planned.
[03:44:55.640 --> 03:44:58.140]   And I must say that your progression of books and podcasts
[03:44:58.140 --> 03:44:59.600]   and where things are going now,
[03:44:59.600 --> 03:45:01.680]   in particular that today you said
[03:45:01.680 --> 03:45:06.240]   you are hopeful that the Democratic Party,
[03:45:06.240 --> 03:45:08.640]   I think most people assume that you're very right-leaning.
[03:45:08.640 --> 03:45:10.800]   I'm not gonna assume one way or the other,
[03:45:10.800 --> 03:45:13.520]   but the fact that you are intentionally inviting
[03:45:13.520 --> 03:45:16.560]   and hoping for opposition so that power is checked
[03:45:16.560 --> 03:45:18.000]   and things continue in the right direction,
[03:45:18.000 --> 03:45:19.000]   I think that's really beautiful
[03:45:19.000 --> 03:45:22.040]   because what you're asking for is more balance
[03:45:22.040 --> 03:45:25.280]   as opposed to more skewing of knowledge and power.
[03:45:25.280 --> 03:45:27.520]   And I think that's a terrific example.
[03:45:27.520 --> 03:45:30.600]   And it's clear that you live right near the edge
[03:45:30.600 --> 03:45:35.920]   in order to inspire us to basically explore knowledge,
[03:45:35.920 --> 03:45:37.240]   explore ancient teachings,
[03:45:37.240 --> 03:45:39.400]   and merge them with where we are now.
[03:45:39.400 --> 03:45:41.360]   - Yeah, well, it's been unbelievably rewarding.
[03:45:41.360 --> 03:45:43.660]   I mean, part of the reason that my wife and I keep touring
[03:45:43.660 --> 03:45:45.920]   is because we meet all these people
[03:45:45.920 --> 03:45:49.360]   and they put their lives together.
[03:45:49.360 --> 03:45:51.700]   It's thousands and thousands of people.
[03:45:51.700 --> 03:45:53.100]   It's so gratifying.
[03:45:53.100 --> 03:45:57.200]   Wherever we go, the probability
[03:45:57.200 --> 03:46:01.980]   that someone will come up and say, "Thank you."
[03:46:01.980 --> 03:46:04.520]   But then when I ask, like, "For what?
[03:46:04.520 --> 03:46:05.720]   "What do you mean exactly?
[03:46:05.720 --> 03:46:06.880]   "What changed?"
[03:46:06.880 --> 03:46:08.120]   They tell me.
[03:46:08.120 --> 03:46:11.080]   And there isn't anything better that can happen to you
[03:46:11.080 --> 03:46:14.280]   than to travel around the world
[03:46:14.280 --> 03:46:19.280]   and have perfect strangers come up to you as friends
[03:46:19.280 --> 03:46:23.840]   and tell you that their lives are far better
[03:46:23.840 --> 03:46:26.040]   than they would have been because of their efforts
[03:46:26.040 --> 03:46:30.040]   and because of their encounter with what you've been doing.
[03:46:30.040 --> 03:46:34.660]   Like, if you could pray for anything to happen to you,
[03:46:34.660 --> 03:46:37.680]   there's not a possibility that you could come up
[03:46:37.680 --> 03:46:39.800]   with a better wish than that.
[03:46:39.800 --> 03:46:43.500]   And so it's great.
[03:46:43.500 --> 03:46:44.840]   It's great.
[03:46:44.840 --> 03:46:49.840]   And it's fascinating to explore its continuation
[03:46:49.840 --> 03:46:53.640]   and to observe the consequences.
[03:46:53.640 --> 03:46:56.400]   And it's a privilege to be in that.
[03:46:56.400 --> 03:46:59.000]   It's an immense, what would you say?
[03:46:59.000 --> 03:47:02.220]   It's unspeakably immense privilege to be in that position.
[03:47:02.220 --> 03:47:05.200]   And it's so great to see people like you
[03:47:05.200 --> 03:47:07.600]   and Friedman and Chris Williamson
[03:47:07.600 --> 03:47:09.040]   and all these other podcasters
[03:47:09.040 --> 03:47:12.560]   who are pursuing the same vision
[03:47:12.560 --> 03:47:14.840]   and so successfully,
[03:47:14.840 --> 03:47:18.860]   and to see the massive effect that's having on people.
[03:47:18.860 --> 03:47:21.040]   That's such a good deal.
[03:47:21.040 --> 03:47:23.540]   So, and I do believe it's the sort of thing
[03:47:23.540 --> 03:47:27.460]   that's in a deeply personalized way,
[03:47:27.460 --> 03:47:31.920]   available to anyone who follows their calling and conscience.
[03:47:31.920 --> 03:47:34.700]   - Thank you for those words.
[03:47:34.700 --> 03:47:37.820]   I also agree it's freely available
[03:47:37.820 --> 03:47:40.300]   by people being themselves and as you said,
[03:47:40.300 --> 03:47:43.300]   following their curiosity and conscience.
[03:47:43.300 --> 03:47:45.300]   Thank you for coming here today
[03:47:45.300 --> 03:47:47.300]   and sharing with us where you're at now,
[03:47:47.300 --> 03:47:50.060]   your knowledge, and please come back again.
[03:47:50.060 --> 03:47:50.980]   I really enjoyed this.
[03:47:50.980 --> 03:47:52.280]   - Hey, anytime.
[03:47:52.280 --> 03:47:54.460]   I appreciate the invitation very much.
[03:47:54.460 --> 03:47:58.780]   And it's a pleasure watching your progress forward
[03:47:58.780 --> 03:48:03.780]   and seeing you propagate all the remarkable discoveries
[03:48:03.780 --> 03:48:06.800]   that have been made in the field of neuroscience
[03:48:06.800 --> 03:48:09.580]   because it's quite the credible enterprise
[03:48:09.580 --> 03:48:13.260]   and people need to know the biology of motivation,
[03:48:13.260 --> 03:48:15.100]   let's say, and the biology of emotion.
[03:48:15.100 --> 03:48:20.100]   And it's great to see you managing that
[03:48:20.100 --> 03:48:22.420]   in a sophisticated way with so many people.
[03:48:22.420 --> 03:48:24.380]   It's a good deal for everybody.
[03:48:24.380 --> 03:48:25.220]   - Thank you.
[03:48:25.220 --> 03:48:27.860]   It's a labor of love inspired in no small part by you
[03:48:27.860 --> 03:48:30.020]   and my other podcast colleagues,
[03:48:30.020 --> 03:48:32.460]   and in your case, my academic colleagues.
[03:48:32.460 --> 03:48:34.300]   So thank you, Jordan.
[03:48:34.300 --> 03:48:36.460]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:48:36.460 --> 03:48:38.220]   with Dr. Jordan Peterson.
[03:48:38.220 --> 03:48:41.500]   To find links to Dr. Peterson's work, his social media,

[03:49:14.480 --> 03:49:16.960]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[03:49:16.960 --> 03:49:18.820]   I do read all the comments.
[03:49:18.820 --> 03:49:21.240]   And if you're not already following me on social media,
[03:49:21.240 --> 03:49:24.080]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:49:24.080 --> 03:49:26.960]   So that's InstagramX, formerly known as Twitter,
[03:49:26.960 --> 03:49:29.240]   Facebook, Threads, and LinkedIn.
[03:49:29.240 --> 03:49:30.480]   And on all those platforms,
[03:49:30.480 --> 03:49:32.640]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:49:32.640 --> 03:49:34.120]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:49:34.120 --> 03:49:35.560]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:49:35.560 --> 03:49:37.560]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:49:37.560 --> 03:49:39.040]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[03:49:39.040 --> 03:49:42.480]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:49:42.480 --> 03:49:43.620]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[03:49:43.620 --> 03:49:44.820]   I have a new book coming out.
[03:49:44.820 --> 03:49:46.440]   It's my very first book.
[03:49:46.440 --> 03:49:47.840]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[03:49:47.840 --> 03:49:50.000]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:51.160]   This is a book that I've been working on
[03:49:51.160 --> 03:49:52.320]   for more than five years,
[03:49:52.320 --> 03:49:54.640]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[03:49:54.640 --> 03:49:56.200]   of research and experience.
[03:49:56.200 --> 03:49:59.260]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[03:49:59.260 --> 03:50:01.740]   to exercise, to stress control,
[03:50:01.740 --> 03:50:04.240]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[03:50:04.240 --> 03:50:07.560]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[03:50:07.560 --> 03:50:09.640]   for the protocols that are included.
[03:50:09.640 --> 03:50:13.520]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[03:50:13.520 --> 03:50:15.920]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[03:50:15.920 --> 03:50:17.680]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[03:50:17.680 --> 03:50:19.440]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[03:50:19.440 --> 03:50:21.960]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:50:21.960 --> 03:50:23.420]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[03:50:23.420 --> 03:50:25.220]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[03:50:25.220 --> 03:50:26.440]   the Neural Network Newsletter
[03:50:26.440 --> 03:50:28.400]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[03:50:28.400 --> 03:50:30.600]   that includes everything from podcast summaries
[03:50:30.600 --> 03:50:31.760]   to what we call protocols
[03:50:31.760 --> 03:50:34.440]   in the form of brief one to three page PDFs
[03:50:34.440 --> 03:50:37.160]   that cover things like how to optimize your sleep,
[03:50:37.160 --> 03:50:38.800]   how to regulate your dopamine.
[03:50:38.800 --> 03:50:41.920]   We also have protocols related to deliberate cold exposure,
[03:50:41.920 --> 03:50:43.740]   get a lot of questions about that,
[03:50:43.740 --> 03:50:45.720]   deliberate heat exposure, and on and on.
[03:50:45.720 --> 03:50:47.800]   Again, all available at completely zero cost.
[03:50:47.800 --> 03:50:49.720]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[03:50:49.720 --> 03:50:51.840]   go to the menu tab in the top right corner,
[03:50:51.840 --> 03:50:53.960]   scroll down to newsletter and enter your email.
[03:50:53.960 --> 03:50:54.840]   And I should mention
[03:50:54.840 --> 03:50:57.660]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[03:50:57.660 --> 03:50:59.880]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[03:50:59.880 --> 03:51:01.440]   with Dr. Jordan Peterson.
[03:51:01.440 --> 03:51:03.680]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:51:03.680 --> 03:51:05.640]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:51:05.640 --> 03:51:08.220]   (upbeat music)
[03:51:08.220 --> 03:51:10.800]   (upbeat music)
