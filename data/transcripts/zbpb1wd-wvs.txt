[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.620]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.020]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.340]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.340]   We are now live today with our annual and lifetime members
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.420]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.620]   First off, I just want to welcome everyone.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.740]   Thanks so much for being here.
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.040]   I hope you're having a good holidays,
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.000]   and I'll wish you a happy new year at this point,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.680]   and again at the end.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.220]   I want to kick off our discussion today
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.480]   by just highlighting some of the incredible things
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.660]   that you all have already done.
[00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.960]   The premium channel, as most of you presumably know,
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.260]   provides support for important research.
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.760]   And when I say important research,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.860]   we can define that as research that is done on humans,
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.080]   with humans, with their consent, of course,
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.260]   that we believe stands the highest probability
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.100]   of leading to new quality treatments and improvements
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.500]   in mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.200]   So support from the premium channel, that is from you,
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.540]   has already allowed us to make several substantial gifts
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.940]   to various laboratories, as well as some other endeavors.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.300]   So I'll just quickly tell you where those funds have gone,
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.540]   and then I'll tell you something really truly exciting
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.860]   about where we're headed in 2024.
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.120]   We'll get to the questions in a moment,
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.980]   but I think this is important to hear.
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.900]   First of all, we made a year-long gift,
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.140]   and when I say year-long gift,
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.380]   we're talking gifts that I certainly can say
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.660]   from my perspective as a researcher
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.380]   who's run a laboratory for a very long time.
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.220]   These are the size gifts that allow researchers
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.980]   to do research that they otherwise
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.940]   would not have been able to do.
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.620]   They pay salaries, they pay for materials in the laboratory,
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.420]   they pay for the sorts of things that allow science
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.660]   to happen that would not otherwise happen.
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.820]   We made a gift to Dr. Alia Crum's laboratory at Stanford
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.820]   in the Department of Psychology.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.860]   She studies mindsets.
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.580]   Some of you may have seen the episode with Allie,
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.940]   as she's called, Dr. Crum, on the human lab podcast.
[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.600]   She's studying mindsets and how they affect
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.780]   both mental health and physical health
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.620]   in children and adults.
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.060]   And that work, hopefully we'll get a report back on
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.940]   at some point soon about how those mindsets
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.580]   can improve performance in schoolwork, athletics,
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.680]   and other areas of life.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.300]   So the idea here is that you supported that work
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.560]   through the premium channel, and then that work can happen,
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.780]   and then we can get the information
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.020]   about what the conclusions of that work are
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.380]   out into the general population, meaning into the public,
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.900]   so that people can benefit from that knowledge right away
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.740]   and in many cases implement that knowledge.
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.420]   We also made a gift to Dr. Sachin Panda
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.140]   at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.340]   Sachin Panda is an expert in circadian biology
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.680]   and intermittent fasting.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.660]   And the study he is using those funds for
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.400]   relates to intermittent fasting as a specific tool
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.540]   for improving mental health.
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.200]   We also made a gift to Dr. Carla Schatz
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.640]   at Stanford University School of Medicine.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.040]   She's studying how the immune system and maternal conditions
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.840]   and especially infections of various kinds
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.640]   that pregnant women sometimes encounter or get
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.300]   can affect the developing fetal brain.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.540]   And that work also relates to stem cells.
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.500]   I know there's a lot of excitement about stem cells nowadays
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.280]   so I'll give you an update on that as soon as I can.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.000]   We also made a substantial gift to Dr. Joanna Steinglass
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.180]   at Columbia University School of Medicine.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.260]   Dr. Steinglass has not yet been on the podcast,
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.640]   but hopefully she will have time to come on the podcast
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.000]   at some point soon.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.600]   She's studying and developing novel treatments
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.940]   for eating disorders.
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.020]   If you didn't see the episode
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.400]   on healthy and disordered eating,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.100]   sadly anorexia nervosa is the most deadly
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.980]   of all the psychiatric conditions.
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.040]   That is a great number of patients
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.280]   that have anorexia nervosa unfortunately go on to die
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.880]   of malnourishment and things related to malnourishment.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.600]   So it's a critical, critical issue
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.420]   that's not talked about enough
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.220]   and frankly is not well-funded enough
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.360]   at the level of federal funding.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.960]   But through your support, there's now funding
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.540]   siphoning into her laboratory
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.640]   and she's directing those funds directly at novel treatments
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.840]   based on neuroscience and habit formation
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.560]   for eating disorders, anorexia and others eating disorders.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.200]   Dr. Nolan Williams, also at Stanford,
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.460]   who does work on transcranial magnetic stimulation,
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.460]   which is a tool to non-invasively alter neural circuits
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.600]   in the brain for purposes of relieving depression and PTSD.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.600]   And excitingly, Dr. Williams' laboratory
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.920]   also combines TMS, transcranial magnetic stimulation,
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.160]   with psychedelic treatments,
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.860]   in particular ibogaine, but also psilocybin.
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.280]   There's a lot of excitement about that.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.080]   And then last, but certainly not least,
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.020]   we also funded a chronobiology conference.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.940]   They were desperate for funds, reached out,
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.200]   and we were delighted to provide the funds
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.860]   for that conference.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.300]   Those funds allowed graduate students and postdocs
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.900]   who come from laboratories that couldn't afford
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.680]   to send those students and postdocs to that conference
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.060]   to attend that conference.
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.600]   And I must say from a lot of years of experience
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.500]   in the scientific community,
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.820]   the ability to attend these high quality meetings
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.140]   is absolutely critical for those young scientists
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.380]   to be able to glean important information
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.940]   and go back to their own laboratories
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.740]   and to make novel contributions.
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.660]   It also can be the difference
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.600]   between a new collaboration getting sparked up or not.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.940]   And I should just mention that the research laboratories
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.340]   that we fund were at a much higher level
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.460]   than the conferences, but the conferences, I think,
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.760]   are also a really important way to direct funds.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.600]   For those of you that don't know,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.540]   chronobiology is how the timing of light temperature
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.940]   and exercise and eating affect health.
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.980]   So all things that I think people are interested in.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.660]   So that's it for what we covered
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.100]   and what we supported in 2023.
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.180]   We're very proud of the support
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.380]   that we were able to provide, thanks to your help.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.620]   And I am very, very excited to announce
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.500]   that while in 2023, it was SciComm, us,
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.540]   the human lab podcast through your premium channel support
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.900]   that allows us to make that support.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.780]   And we had a matching donation, dollar for dollar donation
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.700]   from the tiny foundation heading into 2024.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.780]   Tiny foundation is going to continue to do a dollar, dollar,
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.180]   a dollar for dollar match, excuse me, which is exciting.
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.380]   And we've brought on, in addition to that,
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.460]   two other donors who are going to also do
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.500]   dollar for dollar donation.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.760]   So in other words, for every dollar
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.760]   that the human lab premium channel has or raises in 2024,
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.620]   there will be $3 to match that.
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.660]   So this is phenomenal.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.820]   And what it means is that the SciComm
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.780]   and the human lab podcasts are now doing
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.820]   what's considered on university campuses
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.060]   as major philanthropy.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.560]   So very exciting.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.200]   And so thank you also very much for your support.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.180]   You are making a difference in the research.
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.820]   And I don't just say that.
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.340]   I know anytime there's fundraisers, things of that sort,
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.660]   by the way, this is not a fundraiser.
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.760]   This is us saying thank you to you.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.620]   But it's always hard to know where those funds go.
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.540]   And we make sure that the whole process is very streamlined.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.820]   We cut the fat in every dimension
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.780]   so that the money can go to discovering new tools
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.580]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.760]   So thank you so much.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.700]   Okay, first question is up.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.420]   Carolyn A. writes, "I am interested in studies
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.540]   about the anterior mid-singulate cortex."
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.920]   Oh yes, such an interesting structure.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.720]   "Would you please share any information regarding those?"
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.220]   Thank you for all you do in the Advancement of Science.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.840]   Thank you for all you do in the Advancement of Science,
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.060]   Carolyn and others listening.
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.220]   Okay, so the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.040]   for those of you that may not have seen the episode
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.400]   on willpower and tenacity, but even if you have,
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.940]   is a region of the brain that is involved
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.940]   in leaning into difficult challenges of all kinds.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.500]   This is an area of the brain that gets larger
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.600]   when we embrace effort that leads
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.020]   to a bit of internal anxiety,
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.580]   but it's something that's good for us, an adaptive thing.
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.160]   And this is an area of the brain that gets smaller
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.580]   when we don't engage in challenging endeavors.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.340]   Now, we need to define challenging endeavors very,
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.180]   specifically, challenging endeavors
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.540]   that stimulate the growth of the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.140]   or challenging endeavors that we would prefer not to do.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.700]   We may want the end goal, right?
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.440]   So we may want the consequence of the exercise,
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.700]   the consequence of the learning,
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.780]   the consequence of whatever the challenge is,
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.940]   but that the challenge itself feels uncomfortable.
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.780]   And here, of course, we want it to be uncomfortable,
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.080]   but safe challenges is what's going to grow
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.160]   the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.540]   Now, another thing about the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.300]   that's important is that for people
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.980]   that end up being successful diet
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.060]   or successful pursuit of fitness,
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.940]   for people that complete a degree or finish an exam
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.840]   or things of that sort, the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.680]   gets bigger.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.660]   For people that fail to do the work required to prepare,
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.940]   so the preparation, that is,
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.180]   the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.820]   actually shows a bit of atrophy.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.500]   So the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.540]   is an anatomical and neural reflection
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.540]   of willpower and tenacity.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.400]   And I think what people get wrong over and over
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.580]   about these sorts of findings
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.460]   is that the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.700]   is really responding to a variety of inputs,
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.380]   as a lot of different inputs and outputs,
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.300]   we know that based on neural circuit tracing,
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.300]   but it absolutely responds best
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.300]   to things that feel like that they are indeed difficult,
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.180]   that they are a challenge.
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.140]   So if you're like me and you enjoy certain forms of exercise
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.260]   and it's just pure bliss for you the whole way through,
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.520]   that's not going to grow your anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.140]   However, if you add a bit of, let's say,
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.260]   higher intensity work,
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.860]   I like doing a long run or hike on Sundays,
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.020]   I don't do sprints too often at the end of that,
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.100]   but if I were to do a couple of hill sprints at the end
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.580]   and I really was like, ah, this is rough, this sucks,
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.700]   that's actually the sort of thing
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.700]   that's going to stimulate the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.940]   The anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.220]   since Carolyn, you asked about studies,
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.620]   was actually discovered in cases
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.980]   where people were stimulating this brain area
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.300]   and the subjects,
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.540]   these were people receiving neurosurgery for other reasons,
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.920]   reported feeling like something was impending,
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.540]   some, not impending doom,
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.500]   but there was some challenge,
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.020]   like they were going to head into a storm,
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.860]   something challenging was coming,
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.420]   but the other subjective feeling that they reported
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.300]   was feeling like they could lean into it,
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.220]   like they're ready for it,
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.420]   they were ready to meet that challenge.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.980]   So what you're looking for
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.460]   when you are interested in growing
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.920]   your anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.780]   and I'll tell you why that's a good thing to do,
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.540]   is you're looking for that feeling
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.920]   of leaning into challenge, that friction.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.520]   If something's too easy or it's too delightful,
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.960]   that's not going to contribute
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.820]   to your anterior mid-singulate cortex function and growth.
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.220]   It might contribute to other things, indeed it will,
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.020]   and life isn't all about leaning into challenge,
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.160]   but why would you want to stimulate
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.020]   your anterior mid-singulate cortex in this way?
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.040]   And by the way, those challenges
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.300]   can come from physical endeavors,
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.500]   it can come from language learning,
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.960]   it can come from a hard conversation
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.100]   that you've been putting off that's hard for you to have,
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.660]   Lord knows we all have those aspects of our lives,
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.740]   the things that we're putting off or that are hard for us,
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.000]   or that feel difficult, again, keep these endeavors safe,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.840]   never want to do anything
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.940]   that would damage your mental health or physical health,
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.700]   but leaning into challenge in that way
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.660]   does seem to activate and grow
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.120]   the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.460]   Now, the advantage of that is that there are studies,
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.300]   excuse me, showing that the so-called super agers,
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.140]   the super agers, I don't like that name so much,
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.580]   it's a bit of a misnomer, they call them super agers,
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.820]   but they really should be called super non-agers
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.660]   because these are people
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.540]   who seem to maintain healthy cognitive function
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.900]   much longer than most individuals.
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.180]   Their memory, their IQ remains stable
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.480]   into their much, much later decades of their life,
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.780]   or even improves over time.
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.120]   And then the correlation, and again, this is correlation,
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.320]   but these people's anterior mid-singulate cortex
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.160]   does not atrophy.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.120]   And in general, what the studies point to,
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.520]   and there still needs to be more data collected on this,
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.560]   is that these people are regularly engaging in things
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.880]   that are hard for them and challenging,
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.000]   and they've embraced that challenge.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.160]   So lots to say about anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.960]   but I think that grabs the top contour.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.520]   And I'm a big fan of trying to do something difficult,
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.040]   at least one thing, ideally every week,
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.360]   and perhaps even every day, a little bit,
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.820]   it doesn't take much, maybe even just five minutes.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.160]   It's that friction, that feeling,
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.960]   oh, I don't want to do this, I can't do this,
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.540]   and then continuing to practice
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.600]   or continuing to lean into that challenge safely, of course,
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.080]   that is going to grow that anterior mid-signal cortex.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.600]   And I just think that's amazing, right?
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.040]   We hear so much about brain atrophy and memory loss
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.040]   and et cetera, et cetera, as we get older,
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.740]   a lot of data now about how to preserve
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.200]   healthy physical function.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.120]   Here, we're really talking about
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.880]   how to maintain healthy cognitive function,
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.360]   and the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.560]   seems to be a barometer of how well we are doing that.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.160]   Mark S. asks, "Would love to hear more
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.260]   about an evening routine and not just morning,
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.500]   especially when it comes to light."
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.820]   Ooh, I love this question.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.640]   I love this question because I've made a lot of changes
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.020]   in the last year related to this,
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.900]   because there's this guy on the internet
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.360]   that talks about the importance of getting morning sunlight.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.200]   Just kidding.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.280]   There are several of us, and gals,
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.580]   but I suppose I've been quite vocal
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.320]   about the importance of getting morning sunlight
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.680]   as soon as possible after waking.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.160]   And of course, of course, of course,
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.520]   unless you have powers I'm not aware of,
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.240]   if you wake up before the sun comes out,
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.560]   people always ask, "What do I do?"
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.900]   You wait till the sun comes out.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.360]   If it's overcast, you get outside a bit longer.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.060]   If you want to wake up before the sun comes out,
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.680]   turn on bright artificial lights.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.200]   Now, these days I've actually been playing around
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.080]   a little bit with some bright artificial lights
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.680]   because I tend to wake up before the sun is out.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.520]   It's the winter months.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.240]   But in any case, I've talked a lot about the morning routine
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.220]   in the early part of the day
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.280]   and a bit about the afternoon part of the day.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.880]   Evening routine.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.760]   Okay, well, I'll tell you ideal,
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.640]   and then I'll tell you what I do.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.200]   I'm always shooting for ideal, but I'm human.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.080]   I think there's this idea on the internet
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.880]   that I've seen that my whole life is protocols.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.180]   Protocol, protocol, protocol.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.320]   And indeed, sometimes it looks like that,
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.780]   and indeed, sometimes it doesn't.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.380]   I'm human, things happen.
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.600]   We all encounter different challenges.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.220]   So to answer your question directly, Mark,
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.740]   I think it's, I know it's very important that if possible,
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.940]   that you get a little splash of sunlight in your eyes
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.340]   in the afternoon and evening.
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.080]   Why, why is that important?
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.400]   And what we're really talking about here
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.240]   is not necessarily seeing a sunset at the beach,
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.820]   although that would be great if you could do that,
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.120]   but getting some sunlight in your eyes
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.660]   before the sun goes down, maybe for five, 10 minutes.
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.380]   It's not as important as the morning sunlight,
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.060]   but it does have a great benefit.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.740]   And the benefit is it adjusts the sensitivity
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.440]   of the neurons in your retina and in your brain
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.920]   such that it protects you against brighter artificial lights
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.760]   later in the evening.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.160]   Now, it doesn't protect you completely,
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.080]   but what it does is if normally, and this is true,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.340]   bright light viewed for 15 seconds or more
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.940]   between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.500]   I'm talking about somebody on a standard schedule,
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.640]   not shift worker.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.500]   Bright lights viewed for 15 seconds or more
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.260]   between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.180]   can dramatically quash melatonin levels,
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.740]   melatonin being the hormone that's involved
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.340]   in feeling sleepy and falling asleep.
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.100]   It does other things as well, of course.
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.600]   It's secreted from the pineal.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.740]   We know based on a really nice study
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.180]   published in Science Reports that if you view that afternoon,
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.220]   late afternoon, evening sunlight,
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.420]   you don't have to be too strict about the time.
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.540]   Pop your sunglasses off as long as you can do that safely.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:11.740]   Get some sunlight in your eyes,
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.620]   or if you can't look directly at the sun,
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.620]   and by the way, never stare directly at the sun,
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.460]   at least getting some daylight in your eyes
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.900]   before the sun goes down.
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.900]   That can offset that melatonin reduction by about 50, 5-0%,
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.740]   which is pretty impressive.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.660]   Now, you would still do well
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.520]   to dim the lights in the evening.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.220]   And one thing that I've been playing with recently
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.300]   is using red lights.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.440]   So a lot of people, when they hear red lights,
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.580]   they think, oh, you're talking about red light panel,
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.840]   which that has its uses.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.700]   Those tend to be very bright red lights.
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.940]   Or, you know, portable red light.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.900]   I actually use a small portable red light.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.860]   It looks like a piece of, thick piece of toast.
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.700]   I use that for other reasons.
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.500]   This is not what we're talking about with evening routine.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.200]   With evening routine, it can be beneficial
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.520]   and very, very cost-effective to get some red bulbs
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.280]   and put them in, say, the bedroom where you read
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.380]   before you go to sleep,
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.580]   or in a particular room in your house
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.440]   that you tend to spend time in in the evening.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.420]   Makes for a nice mellow feel,
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.180]   but it also does several other things.
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.660]   First of all, if they're the correct red bulbs,
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.080]   and I'll mention the ones that I've been using in a moment,
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.600]   they eliminate all the blue wavelengths
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.220]   that tend to be stimulating for the,
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.620]   what we call the noradrenergic system.
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.660]   So adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol, et cetera.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.980]   Indeed, there's a study that shows that
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.360]   when shift workers who have to be up at night
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.020]   use red lights of the type that I'm describing,
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.860]   when they work under red light,
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.300]   they have less of a cortisol increase
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.460]   than were they to work under standard fluorescent lights
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.700]   or even standard LED lights.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.300]   So number one thing would be dim the lights in the evening
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.300]   and at night as much as you safely can
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.620]   to perform whatever functions you need.
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.300]   Don't fall, you know, don't burn yourself with a stove.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.800]   You know, if you have to write and do work,
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.860]   as I often do, you need light.
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.400]   But to the extent that you can shift to red lights,
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.240]   that can be helpful.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.800]   And many people, many people, and myself included,
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.660]   find that you get sleepier when you do that.
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.700]   So I might just do this for the last hour of the evening,
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.660]   even if I'm up till 10 or 11.
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.440]   Or if I do it earlier, then I tend to get really sleepy.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.320]   But those red lights, you know,
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.020]   I have a little lamp above my bed.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.140]   I'll do that if I'm going to read in bed.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.380]   I'll make it much easier to fall asleep,
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.260]   probably because of the reduced cortisol
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.700]   associated with eliminating the blue wavelengths.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.980]   And they tend to be fairly dim.
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.300]   And now there's one brand of red light
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.220]   that you actually can, that actually will work on a dimmer.
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.580]   So this is important.
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.260]   I suppose you could use red party lights or Christmas lights.
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.300]   Those can be very affordable.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.640]   Some people do that, but it's kind of festive feel
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.480]   in the room.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.100]   Other people, like myself,
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.580]   will use a red light that's dimmable.
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.380]   I want to mention that what I'm about to say,
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.780]   I don't have any financial relationship to this company
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.580]   in terms of the bulbs.
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:52.700]   Red light panels are different.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.220]   I use the Juve.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.440]   I use Juve type.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.060]   But for red lights that,
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.180]   for the purpose that I'm talking about,
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.380]   that would go into a standard lamp and that you dim,
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.900]   where that's a very different purpose, right?
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.700]   The red light panels have a very different purpose
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.380]   than red bulbs that you would put
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.240]   into a standard light fixture.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.700]   The dimmable ones are called,
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.820]   you can find them as red light.
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.540]   You just put BON.
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:18.540]   It's the technical name of the company is,
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.300]   sorry, forgive me for Googling this now.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:26.100]   Yeah, it's a BON charge, B-O-N, separate word, charge.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.020]   And those are dimmable and they have the proper wavelength.
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.780]   So that's what I use.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.780]   They're not super cheap, but they're not expensive either
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.660]   in comparison to most red light therapies or something.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.860]   So we're not talking about red light therapy.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.140]   We're talking about reducing the overall amount
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.540]   of blue light in your environment, et cetera.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.380]   Now, for many people who don't want
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.300]   to purchase something new,
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.220]   and again, I have no financial relationship to BON charge.
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.300]   So I don't glean anything.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.180]   I buy them with my own money
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.840]   and I just have one or two of them and I dim the lights.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.680]   Even those red lights I dim while I'm reading at night
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.740]   and then fall asleep.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.100]   If you don't want to use red lights for whatever reason,
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.120]   then you would be wise to just dim the lights that you have
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.200]   and where possible to have those lights be set fairly low
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.540]   in your room environment.
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.460]   Now, why would that be?
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.300]   Okay, well, first of all,
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.540]   the cells that activate the alertness system in the brain
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.040]   via the retina, your eye,
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.660]   tend to look up into your environment.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.860]   And that makes sense because they're essentially there
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.920]   to view sunlight and the presence or absence of sunlight.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:25.380]   But in addition to that, think about it logically.
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.080]   If I take a flashlight and I shine a beam on the ground
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.320]   or at a tree in the yard, it looks very bright.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.260]   But you're not getting all those photons in your eyes, right?
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.860]   You're seeing it at a distance.
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.320]   As opposed to shining the light in your eyes,
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.920]   it's very, very bright, okay?
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.520]   So when you have lights that are overhead
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.520]   and going into your eyes,
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.660]   it's very different than the light being on the floor
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.380]   or on a surface.
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.260]   This gets back to something that I often get asked.
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.700]   How could it be that viewing sunlight through a window
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.520]   takes 50 times longer to activate your circadian system
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.860]   than it does when you step outside?
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.700]   Well, let's think about that.
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.080]   When you step outside, there's sunlight everywhere.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.660]   If you face the sun, there's even more coming at you.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.560]   But when you're inside,
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.840]   unless there's a beam of light coming through that window
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.120]   and the window is very clear or open for that matter,
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.580]   you're not really getting the light in your eyes
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.000]   in the same way that if you were outside
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.460]   with the sunlight in your eyes, right?
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.140]   It's the same thing as like looking at a beam of light
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.300]   from a flashlight against a wall
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.980]   versus the beam of light going at your eyes, okay?
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.980]   So we talked about dimming the lights,
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.620]   setting them low in the room.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.840]   It's not red light therapy,
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.620]   but changing over to red lights.
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.720]   Bon Charge is probably just one of many out there.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.240]   I've seen it done pretty nicely with just somebody,
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.420]   people grab red party lights,
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.700]   go on whatever your favorite search engine sales site,
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.180]   and red lights, and you could do that.
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.740]   That's gonna be better than any blue lights.
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.780]   And then if you're gonna be on your screens,
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.620]   here's what I suggest.
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.560]   There's a shortcut function in your phone
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.860]   where you can triple click to switch your phone over
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.460]   to eliminate all the blues.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.940]   This is very different
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.780]   than just using the nighttime function, very different.
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.660]   And I think we should probably put out a video
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.480]   on how to do this.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.260]   What you do is you go into the accessibility function
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.140]   on your phone, you go into color filters,
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.240]   and then you drag down the blues,
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.140]   but that's not how your phone is gonna be set all day
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.200]   'cause then you don't see anything that's in blue,
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.180]   but you can introduce a triple click function.
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.700]   I'll put out a clip soon on how to do that.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.520]   And so when I go to sleep at night or in the evening,
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.740]   what I'll do is I'll triple click
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.340]   and I'll switch my phone over to red only.
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.120]   And that's completely zero cost.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.480]   By the way, it doesn't cost anything.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.320]   And then in the morning,
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.220]   when I wake up at click, click, click and turn on,
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.580]   although I try and get the sunlight in my eyes
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.560]   before I look at my phone.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.100]   Okay, Tom M. asks, light therapy recommendations
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.760]   for those that live in Northern regions
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.440]   with limited morning light or too cold to get outside
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.180]   for morning light, dark when waking, do red light therapy?
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.020]   Great question.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.380]   I'm gonna take a sip of this bone broth
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.180]   because at the rate I'm speaking,
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.700]   if I try and keep this up for an hour and a half,
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.220]   I might get a little hoarse.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.160]   Red light therapy is different than what I just described.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.060]   Red light therapy is the use of red light panels.
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.500]   Can be smaller panels, like the small juve that I use,
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.880]   which is a unit, it's about the size of a piece,
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.700]   I guess they call it Texas toast, right?
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.900]   Texas, thick piece of toast.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.220]   Maybe someone knows why it's called Texas toast.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.020]   I guess it's big.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:10.340]   It's about the size of a piece of toast,
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.660]   provides very bright red light.
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.620]   And in between those red lights on there,
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.500]   there tends to be near infrared light, so far red.
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.140]   So, you know, to a biologist,
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.060]   red doesn't mean as much as the wavelength of light.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:26.220]   So wavelengths in like the 650 to 800 nanometers
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.120]   is what we're talking about.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.820]   Whereas blue light is down in the, you know,
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:32.380]   four and five hundreds and really like 535 to, you know,
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.740]   low sixes, you know, like the rainbow, right?
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.140]   Red, orange and green, blue.
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:41.420]   There are also larger red light panels.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.020]   And nowadays I also see a lot of advertisements
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:44.840]   for red light panels.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.940]   You can actually lie down in red light beds.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.020]   Here's the story.
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:51.660]   Red light will often be marketed as the most powerful,
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.380]   the most intensity, the most luxe.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.680]   Most important is the proper wavelengths
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.360]   or are the proper wavelengths.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.020]   So that's why I use the Juve,
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.900]   because Juve has the proper wavelengths of red and far red.
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:08.180]   The distance to view a red light of that sort
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.020]   generally is about 18 inches, sometimes a little closer.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.820]   Now, sometimes people would put red light
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.720]   on different parts of their body.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.740]   I covered a bit of this in the light and health episode,
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.640]   but red light, because it's longer wavelength light
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.740]   can permeate through tissues to fairly substantial depth.
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.020]   How deep depends on the tissue.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.420]   If you put it up against your skull,
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.620]   is it going to get down into your brain?
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.660]   No, it's not going to get through your skull.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.260]   Maybe a little bit.
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.140]   If it's a very high powered red light,
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.720]   if you're holding a red light of that power at home,
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.560]   something's wrong.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.860]   I don't, that's a medical, that's a medical device.
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.420]   However, Juve are medical grade red light
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.600]   and near infrared lights, and they are quite powerful.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.820]   They're the right wavelengths.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.060]   Actually, that's why I prefer Juve,
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.960]   because they are medical grade.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:55.300]   They can be directed at your eyes in the morning
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.360]   for the purpose of, there's a study out of,
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.380]   two studies actually out of Glenn Jeffries Laboratory
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.740]   at the University College London,
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.160]   showing that viewing red lights at a distance
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:07.180]   of about 18 inches or so in the morning
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.260]   for people who are over 40, but not for people younger,
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.540]   by the way, that can offset some
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.500]   of the age-related reductions in mitochondrial function
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.560]   and vision loss.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.020]   So I look at a red light in this, my Juve Texas Toast light,
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.180]   or I have a Juve panel, at a distance of about,
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.500]   I confess I stand about 12 to 18 inches away,
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.260]   and I do not force myself to look at that light.
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.620]   I don't hold my eyelids open.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.380]   I allow myself to blink so I'm comfortable.
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.260]   Truth told, you could probably close your eyelids,
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.560]   and some of that red light is going to get
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.420]   through your eyelids.
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.100]   Not a ton, but some.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.920]   So no problem blinking.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.900]   You never, ever, ever want to look at any light,
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.300]   sunlight or otherwise, red light,
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.860]   any light so bright that it's painful to look at.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:52.080]   If you have to blink, it's too bright, step back.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.900]   If you have to blink every once in a while, that's okay,
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.020]   but if you have to blink in order to close your eyes,
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.660]   in order to protect your eyes,
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.620]   then you're standing too close.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.100]   In the morning, you can do red light therapy.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.520]   On skin, you can do it on eyes.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.460]   Will it wake your system up?
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.220]   Will it provide the kind of cortisol increase,
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.340]   which by the way, you want early in the day,
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.060]   and adrenaline and dopamine increase
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.860]   that sunlight can provide?
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.000]   The answer is no.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.300]   Sunlight is unique in that way.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.580]   However, if you live in an area of the world
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.020]   that's too dark, or you wake up long before
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.140]   you get sunlight in your eyes, what can you do?
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.900]   Well, you can flip on artificial lights.
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.040]   You would do that the opposite
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.420]   of how I recommend in the evening.
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.880]   You'd want to flip on overhead lights as bright as possible.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.160]   If you have the disposable income and you want to invest
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.600]   in a 10,000 lux light panel or a 900 lux light panel,
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.020]   again, I have no financial relationship to these companies,
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.140]   but there's a light panel, 900 lux drawing tablet
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.060]   that I've set on my desk for a number of years.
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:51.580]   Recently, I confess I've started experimenting
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.220]   with some of the 10,000 lux light panels
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.660]   that sit on your desk.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.420]   Excuse me, those are very, very bright.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.700]   And I do use that now if I wake up really early
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.540]   and I'm going to do some work,
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.100]   I'll turn that thing on and it sure wakes you up.
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.700]   Now, is it as good as sunlight?
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.020]   No, it doesn't have the right color features
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.100]   and alternation between yellow and blue
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.740]   that morning sunlight has and that evening sunlight has.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.140]   And without doing a whole tutorial,
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.340]   when the sun is low in the sky,
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.700]   so-called low solar angle sunlight,
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.500]   you'll notice if you take a picture with your phone,
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.080]   provided it's not a cloudy day,
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.500]   you'll see that there's a lot of blue yellow contrast
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.160]   and that's the optimal stimulus.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.060]   That said, if it's overcast out,
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.080]   you should still get outside
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.540]   because some of those wavelengths are coming through
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.740]   even though you can't perceive the blue and the yellow.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.220]   So these, you could get a 10,000 lux light,
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.660]   but if you can't afford that or you don't want to,
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.520]   oh, and by the way, those you set on your desk,
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.800]   you turn on for five, 10 minutes
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.340]   while you're making coffee and things of that sort.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.780]   They actually recommend that you don't keep them on too much.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.920]   Some people actually can feel a little too euphoric
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.880]   and maybe even get a little headache
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.640]   'cause it's a lot of blue light.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.760]   So that's one thing.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.380]   The other thing you can do
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.660]   is that if you can't access light of any kind,
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:54.500]   so dark, dark, dark,
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.140]   that's where the cold shower really can help
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:59.040]   'cause you get that adrenaline bump early in the day,
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:26:59.880]   which is good.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.720]   So early in the day,
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.940]   provided that you're not going into states of anxiety
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.460]   as a consequence of it, getting adrenaline,
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.480]   dopamine, cortisol increases is great.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.020]   And then as the day goes on in the evening and nighttime,
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.380]   certainly you want to taper
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.980]   the levels of those neurochemicals off.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.940]   Now, of course, there's always going to be some cortisol.
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.200]   There's always going to be some epinephrine.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.060]   There'll always be dopamine in your system.
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.020]   If you go out dancing, you go to a party at night,
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.180]   should you worry about the lights?
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.020]   No.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.060]   Okay, I am not,
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:27.120]   despite what you might presume or hear or read,
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.420]   I am not the sort of person who wears sunglasses at a party.
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.620]   Although the other day I was at a party
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.620]   and someone was wearing sunglasses.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.060]   I think it was for other reasons.
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:38.480]   That gives the impression there was something bad going on.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.120]   I think they were just like looking cool by the way.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.720]   And they did look cool, but I don't do that.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.960]   And if I drive at night, I don't wear sunglasses.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.560]   I do.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.120]   And I have been exploring the use of blue light filter
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.120]   glasses in the evening and those red lights in my house.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.080]   But I think for most people,
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.040]   if you get out every once in a while,
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.680]   you go out to a late night, you go out dancing,
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.080]   you have a party with friends.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.040]   You know, you get home, dim the lights,
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.040]   maybe use those red lights, get to sleep.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.460]   Early in the day, bright lights, ideally from sunlight,
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.760]   bright, bright, bright, bright, bright.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.600]   How bright?
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.120]   As bright as possible and as many as you is reasonable,
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.480]   except to the extent that it could damage your eyes.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.040]   So don't be staring at any bright lights excessively.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:17.880]   Okay?
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.320]   I think that that pretty much summarizes it.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.200]   And then of course, early day,
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.480]   it's really about sunlight or light of other kinds.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.580]   Cold water, if that's your thing.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.040]   If that's not your thing, that's fine.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.580]   There was no tablet that descended down to us,
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.620]   telling us that we had to get into cold water each day.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.460]   It's an option.
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:34.320]   It's all an option.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.420]   Dennis from Munich.
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.260]   I love Munich.
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.140]   I haven't been there in a while,
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.680]   but I used to go in Max Planck, Munich
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.260]   for a number of times per year.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.480]   And I miss the food.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.100]   I miss the schnitzel.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.160]   As we approach a new year,
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.540]   what health and fitness metrics do you recommend checking?
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.540]   Oh, good one.
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.380]   And could you share
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.080]   your annual medical fitness check routine?
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:56.920]   Okay.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.200]   What I'm about to say,
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:05.200]   I'm sure will generally jibe with what Dr. Peter Attia,
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.820]   who I'm sure you all know and who I respect tremendously,
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.160]   also grateful to call him a close friend,
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:15.160]   basically asserts is important for fitness.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:20.580]   I think if you're going to do a fitness test,
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.620]   you know, Peter's got it in mind and I generally agree,
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.180]   you know, you deadlift your body weight 10 times
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.300]   in the same set,
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.620]   hang from a bar for a minute or more.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.760]   Okay.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.140]   In the same set.
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.980]   These sorts of things.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:39.680]   I tend to be far less PE class about it, frankly.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.680]   My goal is always the same.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.720]   I'm 48 years old.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.100]   I've been doing the same training program
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.120]   ever since I was 16, more or less.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.900]   I mean, I've had, you know, peaks and valleys
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.660]   in terms of my consistency based on other obligations.
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.160]   And of course, when I'm sick, I don't train.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.140]   Sick people stay out of gyms, please.
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.200]   Nothing makes me more frustrated than people showing up
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.260]   to get their workout and getting everybody sick.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.100]   Here's the deal.
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:10.980]   I try to be capable, that is ready for various things.
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:11.860]   What?
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.040]   The ability to go on a long hike.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:13.880]   What's a long hike?
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.980]   Five to 10 miles with some hills.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.740]   The ability to sprint for the airplane
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.520]   without blowing a gasket.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.580]   The ability or that means hurting oneself
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:24.740]   or having a heart attack.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.940]   The ability to carry some heavy furniture
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.620]   with assistance safely.
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:34.220]   Or God forbid, to take a trip and not damage myself.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.540]   And of course, to have some level of agility
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.980]   and coordination.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.300]   So how does one do that?
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.860]   So what health fitness metrics do I recommend checking?
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.060]   Well, I'm going to do this next week
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.640]   because it's the end of the year.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.660]   But pretty much every week, it's the following.
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.640]   Three cardiovascular training sessions.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.280]   One is long, meaning an hour to 90 minutes.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.620]   That's going to be slow for me.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:56.880]   So this could be a weighted hike.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.220]   So a weight-vested hike.
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.840]   Or you could just put some weight in a backpack.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.820]   Or just be a hike if it's really steep.
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.920]   Or a long, slow jog once a week.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.260]   For me, it's jogging or hiking.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.360]   For other people, it's cycling or swimming.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.520]   Sometime in the middle of the week,
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.260]   I'm doing a 35-minute run.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.820]   So maybe five minutes of warmup
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.620]   and then a faster 35-minute run.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.560]   You could also do it on a rower.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.420]   You could also do it on a bike.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.580]   But you're really pushing up around, I don't know, maybe,
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.080]   I don't tend to measure heart rate,
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.480]   but where it's, I could not hold a conversation.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.140]   I'm working, I'm working, working.
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.500]   I'm not sprinting, but I'm working.
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.100]   And then another time during the week,
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.860]   a shorter workout of about 12 minutes.
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.300]   It's going to be three minutes of warmup, some calisthenics,
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.060]   a little bit of cycling on an assault bike
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.900]   or something of that sort.
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.540]   Assault bikes are the ones where you have the handles
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:39.820]   with the fan.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.140]   Or it could be a rower.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.960]   Or it could be sprinting a hill.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.900]   And then doing sometimes one minute on, one minute off
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:47.980]   for 12 minutes.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.940]   Sometimes doing 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.340]   for eight rounds.
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:53.340]   And it's real work.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.100]   It's getting the heart rate all the way up, VO2 max.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.480]   The combination of those three types
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.360]   of cardiovascular training sessions
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.680]   are that I'm ready to sprint for the airplane.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.420]   I'm ready to take a long hike anytime.
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.760]   I can go out for a two mile run
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.760]   and really enjoy that if I need to.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.100]   It's a readiness thing.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.340]   And I think it covers all bases.
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.260]   Am I ever going to be a marathoner
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.820]   or a champion sprinter with that or a miler?
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.580]   No, but that's not my goal.
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.000]   And it never has been.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.300]   I ran a cross country race in high school
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.300]   and we'll tell that story another time.
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:26.840]   It was a lot of fun until I hit the second mile.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.380]   The other thing I do three times a week
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.140]   is I work out with resistance training.
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.340]   I train my legs one day.
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.700]   So that's calves, hamstrings, quads.
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.020]   I train my torso.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.580]   So that's, I do some pushing for my shoulders
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.480]   and upper chest and some dips, that kind of thing.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.500]   Some pull-ups, some rowing, the sort of thing.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.340]   And I train my neck 'cause I'm a big believer in that
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:47.400]   for the upper spine, but don't go at it heavy.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.280]   It's just really to maintain posture
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.480]   and to make sure that upper spine is supported,
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.240]   something that most people neglect.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:00.240]   And then one day a week, I do smaller body parts.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.320]   Like I'll train my calves again, biceps, triceps.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.120]   I'll make sure that if there are any small body parts
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.480]   that happen to miss during the middle of the week
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.080]   because of scheduling like rear delts or something,
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.560]   I'll do that, maybe a little bit more neck work
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.400]   or some ab work.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.800]   Okay, those are spread out about a day apart.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.520]   I don't get too obsessed with the spacing
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.840]   between those workouts,
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.640]   but they're not all stacked against one another.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.920]   So it might be, in my case, it's long run on Sunday.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.760]   This is just how I do it.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.080]   Monday tends to be off.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.320]   Excuse me, long run on Sunday or hike.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.600]   Monday is legs.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.660]   Excuse me, Monday is always legs.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.460]   Tuesday off, Wednesday, I generally would do
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.320]   that shorter run or the torso work.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.960]   I'll flip-flop them depending on how my legs are feeling.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.980]   And the next day I do whatever I need to do,
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:44.700]   either the torso resistance training or the 35 minute run.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:48.100]   And then Fridays, that faster clip cardio.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.100]   Saturday tends to be the smaller body parts,
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.780]   biceps, triceps, et cetera.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.020]   I must say these days of the week
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.740]   always have the ability to slide one way or the other.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.360]   So for instance, if I'm traveling
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.620]   and I don't get back on Sunday until late,
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.980]   if I was not able to do that training
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.620]   while I was on the road, then I will do it on Monday.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.260]   And then I'll just slide things around
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.060]   so that I finish off the week with everything done
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.300]   and I can get back on schedule.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.860]   But the way I've arranged it,
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.220]   every body part gets hit twice,
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.060]   once directly, once indirectly.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:20.420]   And the cardiovascular training covers all bases.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.880]   Why train this way?
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.020]   Well, it ensures strength.
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.100]   It ensures whatever aesthetic changes you want.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.500]   You can emphasize working harder and more sets,
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.940]   perhaps for the things that you want to bring up
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.140]   certain body parts that are weaker.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.380]   You can certainly recover
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.700]   'cause you're only training legs once a week.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:37.580]   But guess what?
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.460]   You're doing them on Monday and you're sprinting on Friday.
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.340]   So they're getting hit indirectly on Friday,
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.580]   even if it's on the bike, that fast, hard pedaling
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.460]   with resistance is going to make sure
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.620]   that your legs aren't going to atrophy.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:49.960]   You can still get,
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.840]   but you can still train them again on Monday, again.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.540]   So this schedule is designed in a very specific way.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.560]   None of the workouts except the longer workout on Sunday,
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.260]   that jog or run is longer than an hour ever.
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.580]   It's 10 minutes of warmup and 55 zero minutes
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.780]   of work in the gym, sometimes 60.
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.660]   Sometimes I'll truncate to 45 or 40
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.740]   if I'm really, I have a bunch of things going on.
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.040]   So this sort of schedule sounds like a lot,
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.100]   but it's not, it's actually a very small investment.
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:17.040]   It's about an hour a day and not even on Tuesday,
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.660]   which is a rest day.
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.340]   So what are the metrics that I recommend checking?
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.340]   Well, I'm a big believer that if you're sleeping well
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.500]   and your appetite is consistent
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.660]   and you're feeling generally good,
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:29.600]   that's an important metric.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.380]   It's a very subjective metric, but that's important.
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.500]   Are you sleeping well or are you waking up sore
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.840]   and you're not able to recover?
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.580]   Are you feeling like no matter how much sleep you get,
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.180]   you can't feel rested, these kinds of things.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.500]   Now there could be other factors involved,
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.220]   but that's the sort of a basic one.
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.720]   The other one is how much energy and pep
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.880]   are you bringing to your workouts?
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.720]   That's important.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.320]   And it relates to caffeine and fueling
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.240]   and all those sorts of things,
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.680]   which we're not talking about right now.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.040]   It's far too much to talk about here,
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.000]   but we did cover in the foundational fitness protocol.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.880]   By the way, all of this is put into a PDF
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.820]   that's available online at HubermanLab.com, zero cost.
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:02.200]   Simply go to the newsletter tab under the menu
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.740]   and you can scroll down,
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.240]   find the foundational fitness protocol,
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.580]   gets into sets and reps and loads and all that kind of stuff
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.780]   completely zero cost.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:14.120]   I do take my morning resting pulse rate.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.940]   I know what my pulse rate ought to be.
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.880]   If it's elevated substantially
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.880]   and I'm not particularly stressed about something,
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.440]   then I might pay attention to that
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.360]   and back off a little bit on the intensity on things.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.100]   If I have a throat tickler, I'm not feeling very well,
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.720]   I'm really careful about working out.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.220]   Sometimes I'll do it, sometimes I won't.
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.200]   I'll make sure that it isn't just some sort of like dust
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.600]   or allergen in the environment.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.240]   But if I'm feeling under the weather, I'll take,
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.240]   I'll just skip.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.600]   I just skip that workout.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.880]   And some people go, oh, you know,
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.300]   you skip because you're, you know.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.260]   I'll be honest, I'm 48.
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.400]   I've been training very consistently.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.940]   I am fortunately, knock on wood, a little bit suspicious,
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.560]   knock on wood, I have avoided major injuries.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.400]   I've been able to train consistently
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.420]   and I've also don't tend to succumb to colds and flus.
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.460]   I think about once every 18 to 24 months,
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.740]   I've had a colder flu of some sort for many years.
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:00.980]   That's been the kind of cadence,
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.420]   but not more frequent than that.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.080]   I think in part because I don't tend to push really hard
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.600]   when I'm sick, I tend to be the guy who goes,
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.780]   all right, I'm feeling kind of under the weather.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:09.620]   Should I train?
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.440]   Maybe not.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.720]   Okay, I'm going to take a hot shower and get in bed
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.020]   at 6 p.m., read and go to sleep.
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.480]   If I wake up at 3 a.m. because I went to bed too early,
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.400]   just chill in bed and read, maybe fall back asleep.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.480]   Maybe not.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.200]   I think taking care of oneself in that way
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.680]   is very beneficial.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.360]   And then people say, well, you haven't had kids.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.000]   Well, I've had kids in the house
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.940]   and I also know what it is to get sick
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.320]   because of roommates and all this stuff
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.120]   and working with people and working in a medical center,
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.240]   you're always exposed to things.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.800]   So I hear you loud and clear.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:40.120]   We can't avoid exposure to infectious vectors
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.320]   as they're called, delightful in the form of kids.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.200]   But the reality is I try and back off
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.320]   when I'm not feeling well.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.660]   I push when I'm feeling good.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.600]   I'm not one to do two a day workouts.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.120]   And I'm very careful about not exceeding my program.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.920]   I'm very careful about that.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.300]   I don't go crazy.
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.040]   I don't do two Pilates classes and then go to the gym.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.440]   And I'm also not the guy who's complaining about his back
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.400]   or always being sick.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.760]   And I do not have, you know, like phenomenal genetics
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.360]   for with respect to fitness.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.020]   You know, I'm small jointed or relatively,
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.440]   I have a medium-sized joints.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.080]   You know, I'm not particularly strong
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.760]   nor do I have particularly strong endurance.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.180]   You know, I think I'm kind of in the middle.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.560]   So in terms of medical fitness check,
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.800]   I do blood work every six months.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.140]   I find that to be, that has identified a few things
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.120]   that for me needed taken care of.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.280]   And I pay a lot of attention
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.600]   to overall feelings of wellbeing and I chart them, frankly.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.080]   I, on my calendar or my workouts,
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.500]   I put the level, I put like L1 to 10.
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.000]   Typically my workouts are in the six to eight
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.280]   out of 10 intensity.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.760]   I'm not measuring this by any kind of device.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.160]   And if I get sick, I tend to look back and say,
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.920]   well, what was going on before I got sick?
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.780]   You know, if I'm getting substantially weaker
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:56.000]   or I'm feeling fatigued, I take stock of what's going on.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.240]   So I think some people get the impression
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.280]   that I'm like hyper-analytic about all things.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.280]   And, you know, I would say Atiyah is much more
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.800]   into measuring things and I love that about him.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.080]   I'm more of the mindset, like if I'm feeling good
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.380]   and I feel like I can move my body well,
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.400]   not too many aches and pains.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.520]   Occasionally I get a little something,
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.000]   I have a little disc bulge or something,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.200]   but, and then I take care of it.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:21.120]   But in general, it's about being able to feel good seated,
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.760]   feel good moving, be able to have that readiness,
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.720]   readiness, readiness.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.000]   For me, that's the foundation of health.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.960]   So other things, you get a regular eye exam.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.500]   I do have an appointment in ophthalmology department.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.000]   Do that air puff test for glaucoma.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.180]   There are treatments for glaucoma,
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.120]   but you need to know if you have it.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.900]   A lot of people don't know if they have it.
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.900]   It is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide,
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:41.960]   second only cataract.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.760]   It's very easy test.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.640]   You can get it from optometrists or ophthalmologists,
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.480]   get that eye test.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.240]   Your vision is so precious, vision is so precious.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.980]   So I can't overstate that enough.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:55.560]   It's generally pretty inexpensive as well,
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.280]   especially from the optometrist and the drops work.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.880]   Pablo F asks, "What do you do with waking up
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.320]   in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep?"
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.400]   Oh, such a good question.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.200]   I have three different tools that I use.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.880]   First of all, long exhale breathing,
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.980]   just to try and calm myself.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.520]   I also try and relax my face.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.680]   If I do this right now, it's gonna be funny,
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.240]   but relaxing the face tends to relax the jaw,
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.300]   and then I'll do a progressive body relaxation.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.760]   I do use the Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I app,
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.280]   and they have a specific hypnosis for falling back asleep.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.640]   Hypnosis is self-directed hypnosis.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.360]   David Spiegel, who's been a guest on the podcast,
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.500]   his voice is terrific for hypnosis.
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.180]   Even just thinking about his voice makes me wanna go under.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.000]   Typically with Reveri, you practice the falling asleep,
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.480]   falling back asleep hypnosis, it's only eight minutes long.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.600]   You practice that in the daytime,
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.800]   and then you can use it in the middle of the night
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.620]   if you need to.
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.920]   That does require that you have your phone present.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.860]   And by the way, if you're going to do that hypnosis,
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.920]   you can select whether or not you're going to do
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.920]   the one where you have to interact and speak or not.
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.360]   I like the one where you don't interact.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.240]   Also, if you sleep next to someone, it won't wake them up.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.560]   Reveri is great for this purpose.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.880]   And you might think hypnosis, that's wacky,
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.500]   or that's, you know, magic carpet stuff, but it's not.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.460]   This is, you know, hypnosis, by the way,
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.960]   is one of the few approved medical treatments
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.500]   for various psychological, psychiatric conditions.
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.880]   We're not talking about staged hypnosis,
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.040]   people clucking like chickens.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.280]   We're talking about you learning to self-direct relaxation,
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:18.080]   which is a skill that you can enhance in hypnosis,
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:18.920]   such as with Reveri.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.980]   I think Reveri now is a free trial,
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:24.640]   and it's available on Android and Apple,
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.240]   and it's a nominal cost when you compare to things
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.520]   like supplements or sleeping pills.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.360]   I think it's a few dollars each month,
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.000]   maybe seven, $8, something like that.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:32.960]   Someone will tell me.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.480]   But if you think about the cost relative to, you know,
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.260]   some other purchasable, it's relatively low.
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:40.100]   The other thing,
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.720]   and this is something that's completely zero cost,
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.760]   and I can't encourage it enough,
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.240]   is that you get into a regular practice
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.760]   of non-sleep deep rest, NSDR, or yoga nidra,
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.960]   and that you do that during the daytime.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.600]   There's a 10-minute NSDR that I did,
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.180]   which is available on YouTube.
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.560]   You just put NSDR Huberman.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.920]   It's available, completely zero cost.
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.960]   It will teach you how to self-direct your own relaxation.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.600]   And you can also use it in the middle of the night
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.440]   if you wake up.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.560]   Many people fall asleep during NSDRs, that's fine,
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.040]   or yoga nidras, many of which are available
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.960]   on the internet, free, okay?
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.800]   Completely free.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.480]   Yoga nidra's a little bit different than NSDR.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.140]   It is a category of non-sleep deep rest
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.160]   that includes intentions and things of that sort,
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.000]   self-directed relaxation.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   But relaxing is a skill.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.320]   Now, there are a few things that you can do
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.200]   to avoid waking up in the middle of the night.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.340]   One is try and limit the total amount of fluid
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.220]   that you drink in the last couple hours before sleep.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.220]   Don't go to bed with a super full belly.
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:34.480]   Some people find that if they take theanine,
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.340]   which is something that is in the sleep stack
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.380]   that I recommend, and by the way,
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.180]   I don't necessarily believe that everyone needs
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.360]   to take supplements in order to sleep.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.720]   I think you should get the behavioral stuff,
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.920]   the light, the exercise,
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.600]   not drinking caffeine too late in the day,
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.920]   avoiding alcohol, ideally completely,
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:53.240]   but maybe late in the day, especially, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.220]   And if you can't get your sleep right that way,
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.880]   then perhaps you start to rely on
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.420]   or enhance your sleep capabilities with supplements,
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.420]   but they're certainly not a requirement.
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:05.560]   The sleep supplement theanine,
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.560]   which is in the so-called Huberman Lab sleep stack,
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:12.560]   which includes magnesium threonate and apigenin and theanine.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.780]   Theanine, for some people, can really create vivid dreams,
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.000]   and then they wake up from those dreams
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.240]   and they have a hard time falling asleep.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.960]   In that case, I would just reduce the dosage of
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.720]   or eliminate the theanine.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.120]   Some people like to use inositol,
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.520]   900 milligram inositol, because they prefer that,
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.060]   and that works better for them than the sleep stack,
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.000]   or some people even take it in addition to the sleep stack.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.120]   As long as dosages are followed,
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.780]   there's no reason to think that any of this stuff isn't safe,
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.340]   but of course, check with your doctor
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:42.640]   before adding or removing anything from your supplement,
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.040]   protocol or any protocol for that matter.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.720]   I say that to protect you, not to protect me.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.300]   The other thing that you can do
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.940]   if you wake up in the middle of the night
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.720]   is to not look at the time.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.760]   Now, that's a little bit difficult
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.620]   if you're going to look at your phone,
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:57.060]   but this is something that folks
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.820]   at the Stanford Sleep Clinic taught me,
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.300]   that people who look at the time
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.400]   when they wake up in the middle of the night
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.680]   generally have a harder time falling back asleep.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.700]   So to the extent that you can refrain from doing that,
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:06.920]   and certainly don't get on your phone
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.200]   and start scrolling social media,
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.680]   try NSDR, try the Reverie app,
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.520]   try yoga nidra, try some long exhale breathing.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:15.600]   All those protocols, by the way,
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.280]   include long exhale breathing.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.680]   And if you're taking melatonin before sleep,
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.720]   oftentimes you'll fall asleep very readily and then wake up.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.160]   So if you're taking melatonin,
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.120]   you might want to reconsider that.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.040]   Melatonin does have its place for treatment of jet lag
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.080]   and things of that sort in the acute situations
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.120]   and not taking it too often,
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.880]   but in general, dosages are too high.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.420]   People take too much of it and too often, in my opinion,
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.600]   but that's just my opinion.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.320]   And then I would say,
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.860]   if you wake up in the middle of the night
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.600]   and you simply cannot fall back asleep,
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.520]   just remember that you can survive one night
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.940]   with minimal or no sleep.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:51.960]   Unfortunately, we've all had to deal with that.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.500]   If it starts becoming a chronic condition,
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.840]   then you may want to talk to a sleep specialist,
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.500]   but we've done multiple episodes of the Huberoon Lab podcast,
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.880]   The Master Your Sleep, Perfect Your Sleep.
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.460]   We have a sleep newsletter
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.640]   that you should definitely download.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.600]   It's zero cost.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.460]   Again, huberoonlab.com newsletter.
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:07.880]   Go to menu newsletter and you can find that.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.840]   For those of you that subscribe to the premium channel,
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:14.480]   I'm guessing that you're aware of these various tools,
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.240]   but one thing we know from the sleep lab at Stanford
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.520]   is that when people are excited about their next day,
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.780]   sometimes they wake up
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.460]   and that their sleep actually can be less than normal
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.120]   and they can function well the next day.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.680]   In fact, there've been two studies,
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.640]   at least that I'm aware of two studies, there may be more,
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:35.000]   showing that when people are given a quote unquote
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.120]   poor sleep score, their cognitive performance
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.600]   and physical performance is diminished
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.860]   even if they slept really long and really well.
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.100]   So they've lied to them in these studies.
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:46.700]   Conversely, if people haven't slept that much
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.080]   and they receive a great sleep score,
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.520]   they perform really well.
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.160]   So these sleep scores, while I like them,
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.780]   I look at my eight sleep sleep score or whoop sleep score.
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:59.340]   Some people use aura rings and things of that sort.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.320]   You don't want them to drive your perception
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.140]   of how available you are for hard work
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.660]   and cognitive function.
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:09.460]   So I tend to rely largely on subjective measures.
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.680]   Unless you were talking about things like ApoB
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.400]   or cholesterol levels, subjectively guessing
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.780]   what your ApoB level is, is not a good approach, right?
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.840]   Or resting heart rate, there are real metrics.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.180]   But you want to be careful about relying too heavily
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:25.000]   on biometrics gleaned from devices, even if they're accurate.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.480]   Don't put too much weight into them.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.680]   Take the average, see how you're doing lately.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.960]   If your sleep score is dropping each day by 15, 20 points,
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.120]   well then pay attention to that.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:37.400]   Or your heart rate's going up or it's going down.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.440]   Averages, averages, averages.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.140]   And so be a scientist of yourself.
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.800]   Coach Ruby writes, what's the best protocol
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.860]   for strength training without hypertrophy for women?
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:46.760]   Great question.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.880]   When I've lifted heavy weights, I tend to bulk up fast.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.480]   Okay, I want to embrace more resistance training
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.320]   without the bulk.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.280]   Great question.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.920]   So here's the interesting thing about weight training.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.760]   That's kind of cool.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.880]   You will never get larger than the so-called pump
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.620]   that you achieve in a single workout.
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:04.460]   What do I mean by that?
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:06.560]   Well, a lot of people, and women in particular,
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.900]   are concerned about getting quote unquote too big, too bulky.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.160]   And indeed some women, some men,
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.600]   react very quickly to weight training.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.920]   They have high fiber density.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:20.800]   And for whatever reason, it could be hormones,
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.440]   but it probably also has to do with
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.000]   different types of proteins
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.080]   that are expressed in the muscles
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.680]   and even the connective tissues.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.200]   Some people just grow, quote unquote,
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.440]   faster from weight training.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.280]   But I will tell you this.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.120]   No one's ever looked at a weight or picked up a weight,
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.960]   done a set, and then hypertrophied so much
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.400]   that it was permanent, right?
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.000]   The so-called pump, the blood flow
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.800]   that you get into a muscle gives you a little window
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.080]   into what that muscle might look like
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.280]   if you feed it and rest it properly
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.340]   so it can recover in hypertrophy.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:55.120]   So does that mean that you should avoid the so-called pump,
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.160]   the blood flow into the muscle?
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:56.980]   No.
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:00.200]   What do we know from, gosh,
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.220]   I guess it'd be 40 years of physiological data
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:08.600]   and probably hundreds of years of just
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.340]   outside the laboratory data,
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.480]   that very heavy weights in the range
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.480]   of one to three repetitions
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.580]   generally make people stronger,
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.540]   but there isn't much hypertrophy.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.520]   When you get from three to five repetitions,
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.580]   you're still in the mostly strength, some hypertrophy range.
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:27.200]   When you get out towards six repetitions
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.700]   out to even 30 repetitions,
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.380]   provided the sets are going to failure,
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:33.360]   you can't perform another repetition in good form,
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.760]   well, then you're stimulating hypertrophy.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.340]   Now, there are exceptions to this.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:37.440]   There are exceptions.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.420]   If you do, for instance,
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:43.080]   a one repetition set with a weight,
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:46.840]   but that weight allows you to do that set
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.320]   over the course of 75 seconds,
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.660]   that's a lot of time under tension
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:52.540]   and you can get hypertrophy.
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:53.720]   In addition to that,
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:56.580]   weight training that involves an accentuation
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:57.920]   of the negative, the eccentric,
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.020]   the lowering portion of each repetition
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:03.860]   also will stimulate hypertrophy, but also strength gains.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.720]   So if you're somebody who wants to strength train
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.360]   and strength training is oh so important,
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.500]   not just for muscles,
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.600]   but for neural function in the brain
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.060]   and elsewhere in the body,
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:15.200]   then you really don't want to put on any size whatsoever.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:19.160]   I would encourage you to explore some of the protocols
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:20.720]   that Dr. Andy Galpin and I discussed
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:24.000]   on the exercise series that we did with Dr. Galpin.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.260]   That would be largely training after a warmup, of course,
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:29.880]   in the one to three repetition range.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:33.760]   And even some training that's done strictly for power,
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.740]   moving the weight quickly at loads
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:36.900]   that are substantially lighter.
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.400]   Although for some people,
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.760]   just because of their genetic makeup,
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.520]   they are going to react with hypertrophy
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.360]   to that kind of training.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.160]   So I would say if you want to weight train,
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.120]   which is a great idea,
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.920]   and you don't want to put on size,
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.080]   but you want to get stronger,
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.780]   train in that one to three repetition range.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:55.640]   Now that does not necessarily mean one repetition maximums,
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:59.600]   you know, eking out the absolute last single rep
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.960]   that you can with the most amount of weight.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.600]   Maybe you back off on your single repetition maximum,
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.960]   you're still just doing one repetition.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.240]   But of course,
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.760]   if you want that repetition to be of any value
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.720]   in inducing strength,
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.740]   then you should be getting close to your one repetition max.
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.680]   But keep in mind also
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.360]   that if you're doing three repetitions, heavy weights,
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:21.160]   but you're only resting, you know, 30 to, you know,
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.520]   120 minutes between sets,
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.400]   well, then you can get a kind of compounding effect
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.960]   where you can induce hypertrophy.
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.960]   So if you react that well,
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.560]   and by the way, many people do,
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.760]   or there are some, excuse me,
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.000]   many, most people do not, some people do,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.140]   to lower repetitions,
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:39.600]   then you may have to increase the weight
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.240]   and lower the repetitions even further long rest.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.960]   Just make sure that if you're doing that kind of training,
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.600]   if you're concerned with overall health
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.440]   and not just powerlifting,
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.600]   or being really, really strong,
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:50.760]   that you're also doing some cardiovascular training,
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.620]   which includes, you know, walking plenty
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.160]   and the sorts of cardio that we talked about earlier.
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.560]   Steve says, "What are your thoughts
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:59.980]   on these full body scan MRIs
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:01.040]   that are becoming quite popular?
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:04.680]   Do you think these are beneficial or are they unnecessary?"
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:09.680]   Hmm, well, I got one and I paid for it.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.480]   I didn't get it comped or anything.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.320]   And I must say, I learned a lot.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:18.060]   Fortunately, I learned I don't have any tumors,
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:18.980]   at least not of the size
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:20.940]   that could be detected by that MRI.
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.900]   I also learned that I have a disc bulge
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:25.620]   that explains a lot of times in my life
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:27.160]   where I do a certain movement.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.220]   There's one or two movements that I do in the gym
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:30.600]   where running at a certain stride
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:34.760]   where that thing goes and confirm that.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.320]   So I've managed to,
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:40.160]   I'm very grateful that I only had one white spot on my brain.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.600]   The white spots are considered naturally occurring,
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:46.620]   typically, lesions of neurons.
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:47.720]   Everyone has these.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.640]   You're allowed one per decade of life
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.800]   before they start to consider it a potential problem.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.040]   I think I have that right.
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:57.680]   There's not a whole lot you can do for those, by the way,
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.760]   except don't get any more head hits
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.680]   if you're doing a contact sport or construction
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.880]   or something where you can, you know,
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.600]   but some people still have to continue to work.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.580]   And if that's their work, they have to work.
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.560]   So yeah, I think it was informative for me.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.880]   I watched a Netflix movie in there.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:12.800]   It was pretty cool.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.260]   The movie wasn't very good,
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:16.940]   but it was cool that you can watch a Netflix in there.
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.040]   It's pretty easy to do.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.120]   They're not cheap.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.120]   They're a couple thousand dollars minimum.
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:26.500]   It was reassuring to me to not see any tumors on my liver,
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.700]   tumors on my kidney, knock on wood, you know.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:31.780]   I mean, and to see that I didn't have a lot
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.660]   of intravisceral fat or anything like that.
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.220]   I mean, I doubt I'm the healthiest specimen
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:36.580]   that has ever rolled through there,
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:39.300]   but it was reassuring to me that I wasn't dealing
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.200]   with a bunch of white spots on the brain.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.780]   I wasn't dealing with that sort of thing.
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:45.220]   And, you know, is it necessary?
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.780]   No, no, it's not.
[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:47.820]   Also, some people don't want to know
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.600]   what's going on under the hood.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.060]   Is it unnecessary is what you asked.
[00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:52.900]   That's a tricky one.
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:54.260]   I mean, it really depends on finances
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:55.380]   and how curious you are.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.420]   I will say this.
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.940]   My good friend and former guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.580]   Dr. Eddie Chang, who's a medical doctor
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.140]   and chair of neurosurgery
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.680]   at University of California, San Francisco.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.100]   When I asked him about it and I told him I got one,
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.700]   he said, "Oh yeah, we get people coming in all the time,
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.180]   "patients all the time who've gotten these whole body scans
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:16.860]   "for recreational purposes or because they were curious
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.900]   "and they will identify issues that need to be resolved
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:19.740]   "with neurosurgery."
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:22.460]   Now, that splits my answer in two
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.580]   because that's kind of scary, right?
[00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:27.180]   Could there be walking around with tumors on the brain
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:28.200]   and not even know it?
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.380]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:30.640]   For a lot of tumors are benign.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.860]   A lot of tumors don't impinge on areas of the brain or body
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:36.540]   that create problems and never create problems
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:39.160]   and others create problems.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.820]   And do you want to know?
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:42.460]   Do you want to get that tumor excised?
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:43.660]   There are a lot of non-invasive ways
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:45.080]   to deal with tumors nowadays.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:49.620]   I guess it's a question of whether or not you want to know.
[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:50.940]   And when I say want to know,
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:52.960]   I mean, obviously everyone would love to know
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.940]   that they have a clean bill of health under the hood,
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:58.980]   but are you prepared for what might happen psychologically
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.380]   and medically and what you would have to do
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:05.320]   in order to remove an issue that maybe not an issue, right?
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:08.060]   It's possible that you have a growth or a mass
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:10.500]   that's benign, but then you have the anxiety
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:11.380]   of the period in between.
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:12.860]   So it's tricky.
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:16.700]   Some tissues like prostate tissues or different tissues
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:19.580]   in the female reproductive tract can be enlarged,
[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:20.940]   but not be problematic.
[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:22.860]   But then people might want to make changes
[00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.660]   to ensure that the enlargement doesn't continue.
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:26.760]   I'm a big believer in data.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.600]   I like data.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:29.720]   So while I'm not big on tracking my sleep every night,
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:30.900]   I do track it at night,
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.080]   but I don't necessarily put too much weight
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.580]   on any one individual night's sleep score.
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:39.540]   And by the way, if you get a really lousy, lousy sleep score,
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.380]   chances are you know you slept poorly.
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:42.340]   If you get a great sleep score,
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:44.860]   chances are you know you slept well.
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:48.100]   So stuff in between that kind of gets people interested.
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:50.740]   So I don't know.
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:54.380]   I think for me, I was happy to get the bill of health I did.
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:58.420]   And had I discovered something that needed dealing with,
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.880]   I guess I'd be grateful that I went in for it.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.140]   So that's my answer.
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:03.600]   But again, they're expensive.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.660]   I hope the cost comes down.
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:07.740]   I hope insurance will cover these eventually.
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:09.900]   Orca La Vista, what a great name.
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:10.960]   Orca La Vista.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.900]   Awesome.
[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:16.920]   Asks, would you as a dog lover considering doing an episode
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:18.360]   on dog wellness and communication?
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.200]   Yes.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.780]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:23.120]   I love dogs.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.420]   I love dogs so much, it's ridiculous.
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.120]   I just do.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.000]   I just, I like being around them.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.040]   I like thinking about them.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.220]   I like hanging out with them.
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.980]   And they're family members, right?
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:37.540]   Costello is a family member.
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:40.580]   And I'm eagerly anticipating getting another dog
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:42.800]   probably when we get back from tour in Australia,
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:43.760]   from Australia.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.440]   I'm not going to bring back an Australian Shepherd.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.080]   They have like way too much energy for me.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:48.940]   I like the mellow dogs.
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:50.940]   I like economy of effort in a dog,
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.260]   which is why a bulldog or a mastiff
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:53.760]   is probably a good one for me.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:54.600]   Yes, yes.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:57.420]   And yes, pet health is key.
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.440]   Relationships with pets are key.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.940]   Don't get a dog that you can't take great care of.
[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:05.020]   And bulldogs are a ton of work and they're very expensive.
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:06.500]   Plan on spending at least, I'm not kidding,
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:09.140]   $20,000 a year in medical bills on a dog to keep,
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:10.700]   a bulldog to keep them healthy.
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.080]   Adopt if you can.
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:17.160]   A lot of dogs out there need be adopted.
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.940]   Heidi M says, "I need advice.
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:20.840]   I'm 32, I'm working out for two, three years,
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:23.000]   but my left arm is weaker than my right.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.720]   How do I balance muscle strength between sides?
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.080]   Different weights or strategy?"
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.320]   Great question.
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:31.160]   Well, I guess you're assuming it's a lot weaker.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:34.080]   I mean, I am a big believer in doing unilateral movements.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:36.840]   I can't remember the last time I did a barbell curl
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:41.840]   or the thing they call the EZ bar tricep extension.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:45.660]   I almost always do unilateral stuff, dumbbell curls.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:46.700]   I think the real key,
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:49.800]   if you want a weaker arm or limb to get stronger,
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.780]   is that mind-muscle connection.
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:54.020]   You know, it means presumably,
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.940]   unless there's some sort of underlying neurologic thing
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:57.420]   and I don't want to scare you, it's always possible,
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:00.300]   but it seems unlikely based on the way you word the question,
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:02.420]   is that you want to make sure you're gripping the handle
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:03.360]   of the weight really tightly.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:04.780]   By the way, that will increase your strength
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.420]   and performance on a set to grip tightly.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.180]   There's neural reasons for that.
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:11.820]   And that you're really working hard to contract the muscle.
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.600]   And also use weights that you can control.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.460]   Remember when you lift weights for sake of getting stronger,
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:17.740]   it's not about lifting weights.
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:19.080]   You're actually using the weight as a tool
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:23.140]   to stimulate strength and hypertrophy increases.
[00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:25.580]   So it's a tool and you don't walk around
[00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:28.240]   with the weight number on your body.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.820]   You walk around with the muscle development
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:33.200]   that you achieved and the strength that you achieved
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.280]   with a particular weight
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.540]   and no one cares what that weight is.
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:36.520]   So if you're, you know,
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:39.740]   if you can't carry two bags of groceries up the stairs,
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:42.200]   it doesn't matter if you were able to, you know,
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:46.200]   carry 400 pound dumbbells through the gym, right?
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:48.820]   I mean, that's why I think the readiness thing is key.
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:51.540]   I think we think so much about the gym as the endpoint,
[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:55.620]   but the gym is a place for training for the rest of life,
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:56.500]   in my opinion.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:57.780]   It also happens to be fun for me,
[00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:01.900]   but if your left arm is weaker, I would emphasize,
[00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.180]   well, you could perhaps do more sets.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.560]   Certainly I would do,
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.100]   you could do all your left arm sets first
[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:08.620]   then your right arm sets.
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.660]   If it's really substantially different,
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:14.220]   you may actually want to stop training the right side
[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:16.740]   as intensely for a period of time
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:20.720]   and get that left arm up there, things like that.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.380]   But I like unilateral work.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:25.460]   I don't do a lot of unilateral work for my legs.
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:26.500]   One thing I do, leg curls.
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:28.340]   No, that's both legs, same time.
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:30.340]   I definitely try and pull with both legs, same time.
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.460]   Leg extension, same time.
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:33.380]   Hack squat, same time.
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:34.220]   Glute hammering, same time.
[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:35.060]   Okay, yeah.
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:39.140]   Just keep training it, but don't overtrain it.
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:41.660]   If it's really weak because you're giving it 25 sets,
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:43.500]   make sure you're allowing time for it to recover.
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:47.180]   And by the way, I don't know how,
[00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:48.640]   I don't recall 'cause the question's gone now,
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.500]   how old you are, but give your body time.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:52.340]   Give your body time.
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:53.580]   I started training when I was 16.
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:55.140]   Give your body time.
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:56.900]   It takes time to train correctly
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.180]   and it takes time to develop
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.540]   a strong mind muscle connection.
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:02.560]   And don't rush, don't run out there and start using,
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:06.580]   don't get cavalier with pharmaceuticals or anything else.
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.380]   Just take your time, enjoy your training.
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:10.380]   The best advice I ever got about training
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.620]   was somebody very accomplished and he said,
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:15.980]   and I really internalized this, like,
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:19.080]   learn to, and you may delete the learn to,
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:22.240]   learn to enjoy training really hard
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.300]   or just love training hard.
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:25.660]   I love training hard.
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:27.380]   I love it, I love it, I love it.
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:29.260]   So just learn that, like lean into that process
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:30.340]   and enjoy it.
[00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:32.360]   And if there's certain parts that are challenging,
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.580]   remember you're increasing the size of that medial,
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.640]   anterior mid cingulate cortex.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.160]   Last question, really?
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:39.940]   I was hoping we would just keep going.
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:42.300]   Maybe I'll do like a 24 hour marathon of this
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:45.620]   and then we also do it as a study in sleep deprivation.
[00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:47.240]   Does anyone want to vote for that?
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:48.080]   I've done that before.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.780]   I used to work 36 hour stretches
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:51.800]   when I was in graduate school, no joke.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.900]   We would do these physiology experiments.
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.320]   My producer here is sitting here going like, don't do it.
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:57.740]   But it's probably by the end of those experiments,
[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.180]   we'd be wearing tinfoil on our heads
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:00.060]   and we were doing these experiments,
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.620]   but we built a lot of resilience.
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.280]   We used to survive on In-N-Out burgers
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.380]   and I was like, don't eat the bun
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:05.900]   'cause the carbs will make you sleepy.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.380]   And then we'd argue about it and we'd, you know,
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:11.240]   we'd start to hallucinate somewhere around the 30 hour mark.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.080]   And my friend Colenzo,
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.520]   he's now a professor back at University of Maryland.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.380]   So he can vouch for that story.
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.820]   But gosh, that was fun.
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.220]   I don't miss it.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.180]   I was in my 20s, 30s.
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.700]   Yeah, no, 20s, late 20s.
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:27.500]   But if people think maybe we do a fundraiser,
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.940]   like raise extra money for research
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:31.940]   and I'll do 24 hours of just answering questions
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.700]   around the clock and just see how, you know, see at what point
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.440]   I just completely, and then I can also teach you guys
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:40.820]   how to do a proper all nighter 'cause there are tools.
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:43.620]   And one of the main tools is don't trust your thinking
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:47.100]   between the hours of 2.30 AM and 4 AM.
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.880]   So maybe during that time, we just all meditate together.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.540]   All right, last question.
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:55.000]   Until we do the 24 hour Huberoon Lab AMA marathon,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.180]   do you have plans to produce more content or protocols
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:59.100]   specifically for children's development and health?
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:01.740]   Yes, we're going to do a children's or child development
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.720]   series, but that also extends into adolescence
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.940]   and young adulthood.
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:06.500]   Most are going to be doing episodes on that.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.220]   Some amazing guests for them and do some solos as well.
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:10.700]   Are there any current resources you recommend
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:11.540]   for this topic?
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:13.380]   Yeah, I like Alan Shore's book.
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:17.580]   It's a little detailed, little technical, S-C-H-O-R-E.
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:19.140]   Alan Shore, I think it's how you spell it.
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.060]   Let me check, let me check, @ucla.
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.940]   Little tech, Alan Shore.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:29.660]   Yeah, A-L-L-A-N, separate word, S-C-H-O-R-E.
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.780]   He's a psychologist and researcher,
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:34.780]   really talks about regulation of the,
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:36.140]   he talks about right brain, left brain
[01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:37.660]   in a way that actually is accurate.
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.180]   There are very few people talk about right brain,
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:40.700]   left brain accurately, he does.
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.380]   And talks about attachment and emotional regulation.
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:47.180]   And it's mainly focused on early childhood development.
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:49.700]   There's some beautiful, you know,
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.100]   there's some beautiful stuff out there
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.260]   that's been, comes from the psychology literature
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.620]   and neuroscience literature on this.
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:58.180]   But I'm also going to get my friend,
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.700]   Dr. Linda Wilbrecht on the podcast.
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:00.780]   She's a professor up at Berkeley,
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.540]   studies adolescent development.
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.340]   There's just so many great folks out there
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.020]   that we want to bring onto the podcast.
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:09.220]   And we will organize that into some protocols
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.660]   and things of that sort.
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:13.380]   A lot of work to do for us to get it all, you know, succinct.
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:15.020]   I realize sometimes podcasts are long.
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:17.460]   You know, sometimes people ask, I often get asked, you know,
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.860]   what are the plans for 2024?
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.000]   What are you going to do?
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.040]   Keep improving the content.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.580]   We actually have some shorter form content coming out.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:25.700]   I don't want to give away what that is.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.300]   You know, some 30 minute episodes
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:31.560]   that capture the essence of the most important protocols
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.400]   in science.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.180]   And yeah, the goal for 2024 and forward
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:38.660]   is just keep improving the content
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:41.460]   and try and make it as succinct and digestible
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.400]   for you as possible, but also as thorough.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.620]   You know, if I go real short form,
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:47.440]   then important details will get lost.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.140]   But child development is extremely important.
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:51.500]   And remember, we're always in development.
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.940]   Development doesn't stop when we hit 25.
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:55.900]   Development is an arc from birth until death,
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:59.240]   which hopefully will be a long time from now for all of you.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.700]   And there's just a ton to explore there.
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:03.380]   A lot of science, psychology, protocols.
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.800]   We're going to get into all of it.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.460]   So I was told that's the last question.
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:09.620]   I confess I'm a little bit sad about that.
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.860]   I could just keep going.
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:13.980]   But maybe we'll do this again at some point.
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:15.840]   And I think we should do that 24 hour marathon
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.860]   as a fundraiser.
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.540]   I don't know what you think, but I don't know.
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:19.780]   I would do it anyway.
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:21.740]   That's the truth, I'd be here anyway.
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:25.260]   I want to thank everyone for tuning in.
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.300]   Thanks ever so much for your support
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.900]   of the labs I mentioned earlier.
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:32.620]   If you know somebody who you think might be interested
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:34.960]   in the premium channel, let them know that they can watch
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.700]   the early parts of those premium channel episodes
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:40.040]   on YouTube and listen to them on Apple and Spotify
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.980]   without having to log on for, you know,
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:44.860]   not having to pay, not everyone has the resources.
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:47.320]   For those of you that devoted resources to the podcast,
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.380]   the premium channel,
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.200]   just know that it helps support the regular podcast,
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.180]   which of course is available cost free to everybody.
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:54.420]   It really subsidizes that.
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:57.220]   And it's also subsidizing this research
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:58.580]   that's taking place in these laboratories.
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:03:59.680]   And we're going to expand the research.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.900]   We got that three to $1 match for 2024.
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:05.060]   So I really enjoyed today.
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:05.900]   That's the truth.
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:06.820]   I love your questions.
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:08.540]   I could do this all day every day.
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:12.180]   We're going to record an episode today and tomorrow.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.700]   And I'm basically just going to keep talking
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.860]   until they tell me it's time to stop.
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:17.420]   So when someone in the corner goes like this,
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.260]   then I'll stop.
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:19.340]   We're in one of our live events.
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.920]   Like they're supposed to end the night there.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.760]   There we go.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.580]   They're telling me to stop.
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:23.420]   Time's up.
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:25.420]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:26.820]   I hope you had a great holiday.
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.980]   I hope everyone has a very happy New Year's.
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:31.220]   If you're like me and you're going to be asleep
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:33.180]   by 1030 on New Year's,
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:35.380]   enjoy the good night's sleep and enjoy New Year's Day.
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:36.780]   I'm a big New Year's Day guy.
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.780]   Get out on New Year's Day and enjoy something.
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:41.100]   And just remember whether or not
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.620]   you're doing behavioral protocols
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:44.420]   or you're super into the supplements of the red lights.
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:47.660]   The most important thing is those pillars of, you know,
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:51.840]   sleep, nutrition, exercise, stress management, sunlight,
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.900]   I guess we're getting up to six, and social connection.
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.700]   So it's a lot to try and do all that all the time.
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.620]   Don't pressure yourself.
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.700]   Meanwhile, thank you for everything that you do for us.
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.700]   And last but certainly not least,
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.440]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.020]   [upbeat music]
[01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:10.160]   (upbeat music)
