[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.920]   Previously on Grace TV. Two men side by side for three years experiencing exactly the same thing
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:19.460]   in the presence of the glorious Son of God, together ended up as separated as two human
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:28.200]   beings can be, one in heaven and one in hell. Judas, for whom Jesus was a disappointment,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:37.860]   whom he resented if not hated. Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom he loved. How you feel
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.980]   about Christ, how you view Him, will determine your heaven or your hell. What in the world makes
[00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:56.400]   us so embarrassed about the gospel? I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.400]   and Him crucified. I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.520]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.520]   And Judas has given them a sign, verse 48, "He who was betraying Him gave them a sign
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:11.520]   saying, 'Whomever I kiss, He's the one sees Him.'" There's some profound anxiety about
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.520]   that. There's some profound bitterness in that. There's hatred in that. There's a lot
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:33.520]   of hatred in that. And Judas has given them a sign, verse 48, "He who was betraying Him
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.520]   gave them a sign, verse 48, 'Whomever I kiss, He's the one sees Him.'" And Judas has given
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.520]   them a sign, verse 48, "He who was betraying Him gave them a sign, verse 48, 'Whomever I
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.520]   kiss, He's the one sees Him.'" And Judas has given them a sign, verse 48, "He who was betraying
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.520]   Him gave them a sign, verse 48, 'Whomever I kiss, He's the one sees Him.'" And Judas has
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.520]   given them a sign, verse 48, "He who was betraying Him gave them a sign, verse 48, 'Whomever I
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520]   kiss, He's the one sees Him.'" And Judas has given them a sign, verse 48, "He who was betraying
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.520]   Him gave them a sign, verse 48, 'Whomever I kiss, He's the one sees Him.'" And Judas has
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   given them a sign, verse 48, "He who was betraying Him gave them a sign, verse 48,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.520]   'Whomever I kiss, He's the one sees Him.'" And Judas has given them a sign, verse 48,
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.520]   "He who was betraying Him gave them a sign, verse 48, 'Whomever I kiss, He's the one sees
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.520]   Him.'" And Judas has given them a sign, verse 48, "He who was betraying Him gave them a
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   sign, verse 48, "He who was betraying Him gave them a sign, verse 48, 'Whomever I kiss,
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.520]   He's the one sees Him.'" And Judas has given them a sign, verse 48, "He who was betraying
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.400]   Totally unbelievable what Judas has done.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.380]   Verse 57 says, "When they had seized Him, they led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest."
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.840]   They were gathered together in this phony trial with false accusations.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.220]   They tried to bribe witnesses to lie about Him, verse 59, trying to obtain false testimony
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.520]   against Jesus so they could have a reason to put Him to death.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.280]   They couldn't get people who could get their story together, though many people tried because
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.080]   they would be paid if they could.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.780]   And finally some people came along and said He was going to destroy the temple of God
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.440]   and rebuild it in three days, which He said at the beginning of His ministry.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.660]   And this mock trial went from the high priest to Herod to Pilate, and you know all the phases
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.980]   of that trial.
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.480]   The final adjudication, the high priest, verse 65, tears his robes.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.640]   He's blasphemed.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.440]   What further need do we have of witnesses?
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.520]   You have now heard the blasphemy.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.520]   What do you think?
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.980]   And here's the final verdict on Jesus.
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.980]   He deserves to die.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.980]   They sentence Him to death.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.140]   That's the death penalty.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.140]   Then they spat in His face, beat Him with their fists, and others slapped Him and said
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.040]   mockingly, of course, "Prophesy to us, you Christ, who is the one who hit you?"
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.420]   That's the outcome of what Judas did.
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.820]   That's the outcome for Jesus of His betrayal.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.980]   But what about Judas?
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.800]   Go down to chapter 27.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.880]   When morning came and the phony trial...
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.860]   went through the night, all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.060]   against Jesus to put Him to death, bound Him, led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate,
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.420]   who was the governor, head of the Roman force who would be the executioners.
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.000]   And then we read concerning Judas in verse 3.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.540]   Then when Judas who had betrayed Him saw that He had been condemned, he felt remorse and
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.680]   returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying, "I have sinned
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.780]   by betraying innocent blamers."
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.780]   He said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."

[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."

[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:35.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:40.780]   Judas said, "I have sinned."
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:52.600]   And in verse 31, Jesus makes an amazing statement, "You will all stumble.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.960]   You will all trip up.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.660]   You will all fall away because of Me this night.
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.180]   For it is written," and He quotes Zechariah 13:7, "I will strike down the shepherd and
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.020]   the sheep of the flock shall be scattered."
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.220]   You're all going to defect.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.720]   You're all going to fall.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.720]   You will all be literally offended.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:23.600]   You'll all have a kind of tacit denial, tacit betrayal.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.920]   Now we don't have the record that the ten in between Peter and Judas actually denied
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.060]   Jesus verbally, publicly, openly.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:36.300]   They just ran and hid.
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.660]   But then He says in verse 32, "After I've been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee,"
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.660]   which means that they're dead.
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.660]   They're dead.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.660]   They're dead.
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.660]   They're dead.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.660]   They're dead.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.660]   But if they had defected, they would all be brought back together again.
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:55.740]   Theirs would be a temporary stumbling, a temporary falling, temporary defection, not like Judas.
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.820]   His was forever.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:05.960]   Well, this gives Peter the opportunity to boast.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.600]   Verse 33, "Peter said to Him, 'Even though all may fall away because of You, all will fall away because of You.'"
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:16.620]   Peter said to Him, "I will never fall away, never."
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.620]   He's adamant, confident.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.460]   "Jesus said to him, 'Truly I say to you that this very night before a rooster crows, you
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.520]   will deny Me three times.'"
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.440]   Rooster crows around 3 A.M. in the morning.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.280]   You're going to deny Me three times before a rooster crow.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:40.540]   "Peter said to Him, 'Even if I have to die with You, I will not fall.'
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.280]   I will not deny You.'"
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:48.580]   All the disciples said the same thing too.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.580]   What a profession.
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:09:00.780]   As it turned out, Peter was overconfident.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.500]   Jesus had warned him, "You're going to deny Me.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:10.480]   You who said on another occasion, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,' you're
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.020]   the same one who also said, 'No, no, no, Lord, You're not going to die.'"
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:19.900]   And at that moment Jesus said, "Get behind Me, Satan.
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:25.220]   You with all the best theology, you with all the best of intentions, you're going to fail
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.520]   and you're going to fail dramatically.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.520]   You're going to be ashamed of Me.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.520]   You're going to deny Me.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.520]   You're going to betray Me."
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.460]   And sure enough it happened.
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.420]   Go to verse 69.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:46.480]   "Jesus taken to the house of the high priest," trials going on, "Peter sitting outside in
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.480]   the courtyard.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:55.140]   Servant girl came to Him and said, 'You two were with Jesus the Galilean,' but He denied
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.980]   it before them all saying, 'I did not know what you're talking about.'"
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:05.480]   When He had gone out to the gateway, He heads for the door to get away from the fire because
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.360]   it lightens His face and He hides into the darkness a little bit, but another servant
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:17.960]   girl saw Him and said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth and again
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.220]   He denied it, this time with an oath.
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:26.060]   I don't know the man, he's lying and he's taking an oath that he's telling the truth
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.480]   when he knows he's lying."
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.760]   A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Surely you two are one of
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.780]   them for even the way you talk gives you away."
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.620]   You have a Galilean accent.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.300]   We hear it.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.300]   This is amazing.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:48.360]   Then He began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man."
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.700]   And immediately the rooster crowed.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:57.360]   The trial went through the night at the time when the rooster would crow, early before
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.760]   dawn.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:05.760]   The signal was given on schedule right after Peter on three occasions in three locations
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.240]   to different people had betrayed Jesus.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:16.020]   Judas couldn't deal with the guilt of his betrayal.
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.720]   He felt remorse.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.360]   He felt guilt.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.980]   He felt sadness, sorrow that was so overwhelming that he killed himself.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.180]   That's serious.
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:34.640]   When you commit suicide under the weight of guilt, you feel the guilt profoundly.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.640]   What about Peter?
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.480]   Did he kill himself?
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.980]   Done the same thing?
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.180]   Hadn't done it for months.
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.360]   Hadn't done it for money, but he'd done it.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.600]   In a sense, he was saying, "This isn't the Christ."
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.720]   He was giving them the same attitude that Judas gave them when he was willing to sell
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.720]   Jesus.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:12:00.780]   But verse 75 says, "Peter remembered the words which Jesus had said, 'Before a cock crows,
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.060]   you will deny Me three times.'
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.160]   He went out and wept bitterly."
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.560]   He didn't kill himself.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.120]   He just went out and wept bitterly.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.660]   He cried and wept.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.500]   Something happened in that moment you need to know about.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:22.900]   In the middle of Peter's denial, as his denial was coming to its end, Luke 22:61 says this.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.260]   Now they're in the courtyard of the high priest.
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.900]   Peter's milling around there in the shadows.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.300]   Jesus is there being tried.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.660]   Peter's kept his distance.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:40.060]   But it says in Luke 22:61, "And the Lord turned and looked at Peter."
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:47.580]   Eyeball to eyeball.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:54.440]   When Judas and Jesus' eyes met in the darkness of Gethsemane, Judas kissed him with a kiss
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:00.300]   of hate, the kiss of a hypocrite.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:06.540]   When the eyes of Peter met the eyes of Jesus, he was crushed.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.420]   He was shattered.
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.000]   He was devastated.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.860]   and broke down in genuine tears of true repentance.
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.740]   Crushing sadness led Judas to suicide without repentance.
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:27.100]   Crushing sadness led Peter to restoration with repentance.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:32.700]   And the difference was the way they looked at Christ, the way they responded to Christ.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:40.340]   For Peter, the vision of Christ drew him to repentance.
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:45.140]   For Judas, the vision of Christ drew him to suicide.
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.400]   You might say, "For Peter, the vision of Christ drew him to heaven.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.640]   For Judas, the vision of Christ drew him to hell."
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.940]   What was the difference?
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.960]   Peter loved Jesus Christ.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.720]   He loved Him.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.720]   After the resurrection in Galilee, according to John, "The Lord was with him and he was
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.700]   with the people of Israel."
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.800]   John 21, Jesus found Peter.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:10.360]   He found him fishing, which he shouldn't have been doing, but he was.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.620]   And he had breakfast with him by the shore of the lake.
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:21.420]   And he said this to Peter, "Peter, do you...what?...do you love Me?"
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.400]   That's always the question, folks.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.400]   That's the question.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.220]   Don't get too complicated about what it means to be a Christian.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.760]   It means you love Christ.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.320]   That's what it means.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.260]   "Peter, do you love Me?"
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.720]   "Yes, Lord, feed My sheep."
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:41.020]   "Oh, Peter, do you love Me?"
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.220]   "Yes, Lord, feed My lambs."
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:51.860]   A few moments later, "Peter, do you really love Me?"
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.220]   And Peter was grieved because he said the third time, "Do you love Me?"
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.500]   And what was Peter's response?
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.980]   "Lord, You know my heart.
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.820]   You know I love You."
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.520]   There is so much simplicity in that.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.140]   What does it mean to be a Christian?
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.120]   What is the difference between Judas and Peter?
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.680]   Love for Christ...love for Christ.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.300]   That's the difference.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.380]   That's the message of Christianity.
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.660]   Feed My sheep, feed My lambs, feed My sheep.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:28.580]   You're Mine, do My work based on the fact that you love Me.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.580]   How you feel about Christ?
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:36.820]   How you view Him will determine your heaven or your hell.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.480]   Peter was a betrayer.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.640]   And we could see how it happened.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.040]   He boasted too much.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.660]   He prayed too little.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.980]   He acted too fast, drew out a sword and wanted to make a war.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.980]   He followed too far.
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:51.980]   He stayed off in the shadows.
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:16:01.340]   So you could say, "Yeah, there were some factors in overconfidence and lack of prayer and impulsiveness,
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.800]   and cowardice."
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.580]   But Peter was no final disaster.
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.960]   He was no final disaster.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.120]   Grace was operating in Peter's life.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.360]   Grace was not operating in Judas' life.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:20.080]   Grace was operating in Peter's life because Peter loved Jesus Christ.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:28.480]   And John tells us in 1 John 4, "We love Him because He first loved us."
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.100]   Jesus had set His love on Peter.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.500]   He loved him in return.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.220]   They had a relationship of love.
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:40.120]   That is the deep and compelling attitude of the true believer.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:46.920]   It comes down to this, the true believer's love for Christ is the evidence of salvation.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.920]   In fact, in 1 Corinthians 16:22, Paul says, "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.920]   let him be damned."
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.020]   It comes to that.
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.480]   You look at Christianity, you look at the church and you can get very complicated about
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.860]   what it means to be a Christian.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.100]   It's this simple.
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.180]   Look at your heart.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.920]   Do you love Christ?
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.140]   Do you seek His honor, seek His glory?
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.060]   Does your heart go out in affection toward Him?
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:21.140]   Do you desire to please Him, exalt Him, love Him, worship Him, commune with Him, hear Him?
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.340]   I'll sum it up.
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:27.620]   If you love me, John 14, you keep my...what?...commandments.
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.260]   You love His Word.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.620]   You love Him.
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:31.920]   You love Him.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:37.480]   That's how love acts.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.260]   That was Peter.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.500]   Back in John 6, many of the disciples who didn't love Jesus but hung around left.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.340]   John 6 says, "Many of His disciples walked no more with Him."
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.660]   And then Jesus said, "Do you also want to go away?
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.660]   Do you also want to leave?"
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.300]   And Peter says, "To whom will we go?
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.740]   You and you alone have the words of life."
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.380]   We don't want to go, we want to stay because You give us the words of life.
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.380]   And Peter said, "We'll go to the Lord."
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.380]   We don't want to go to the Lord.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.380]   We want to go to the Lord.
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.380]   We don't want to go to the Lord.
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.380]   We want to go to the Lord.
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.380]   We want to go to the Lord.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.380]   We want to go to the Lord.
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.380]   Peter was a man of faith.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.380]   He loved his Lord and he loved the truth that his Lord conveyed.
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:15.240]   Love desires to know the truth and obey the truth.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.520]   Peter was secure because he had a love relationship with Christ.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.900]   Remember back in Luke 22 verse 31, Jesus said to Peter, "Peter, Satan desires to have
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.380]   you that he might sift you like wheat.
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.140]   Satan desires to have you."
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.600]   He's come and asked permission to go after you.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.560]   He's going to sift you like wheat.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.940]   But when you are converted, strengthen the brethren.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.740]   What was the guarantee that he would be converted, that he would survive that?
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:55.240]   Jesus said this one line, "I have prayed for you that your faith fail not."
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.900]   He secures his own by his own intercessory prayer.
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.580]   The Lord loved Peter.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.260]   Peter loved the Lord.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:11.840]   The Lord kept Peter even in the midst of a terrible betrayal.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:19.280]   Peter was restored, recommissioned and became the great gospel preacher in the first era
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.780]   of the church.
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.680]   From the beginning of Acts, Acts chapter 2 where he preaches on Pentecost, he's the dominating
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:29.660]   preacher for the first twelve chapters of Acts, the history of the church.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:36.540]   Now let me say something that is very important at this point.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.040]   Sin and guilt do not produce true repentance.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.600]   Sin and guilt do not produce true repentance.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.980]   They may produce remorse.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.740]   They may produce regret.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:54.320]   They may produce sorrow and sadness and it can even be so severe that it's deadly.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.420]   People kill themselves because they can't bear the consequences of their evil.
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:06.880]   But sin and guilt do not produce true repentance.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.240]   The horror of Judas' sin didn't make him repent.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.240]   Listen.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:16.000]   And the horror of Peter's sin didn't make him repent.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.320]   And the ugliness of your sin and the weight of your guilt will not make you repent.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:26.840]   It is not enough to make a sinner repent.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.180]   It is enough to make you sad and full of remorse.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:35.500]   It is enough to make you try to undo it and even make you kill yourself.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.720]   But it's not enough to bring you to true repentance.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:48.740]   What makes the sinning, guilt-ridden soul repent is seeing and loving Christ...seeing
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:53.680]   and loving Christ.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.940]   Christ becomes all in all, source of grace and salvation.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:59.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:01.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:02.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:03.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:04.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:06.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:07.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:08.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:09.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:10.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:11.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:12.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:13.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:14.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:16.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:17.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:19.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:20.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:23.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:25.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:28.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:29.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:33.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:34.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:35.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:36.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:38.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:39.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.940]   He is the only one who can do it.

[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:43.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:45.940]   He is the only one who can do it.
