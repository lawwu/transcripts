[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   We resume our studies in the Epistle to the Romans by looking again at the words which
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.920]   are to be found in chapter 8, reading verses 28, 29, and 30.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.320]   Verses 28 to 30 in the 8th chapter of Paul's Epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.840]   And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.040]   are the called according to his purpose.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:39.200]   For, whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.840]   he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.320]   Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.200]   justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.240]   Now I would remind you of what we are doing here, and what the Apostle is saying.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.760]   I must recapitulate the argument for a moment.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.800]   The fundamental thing that he is concerned about as a pastor is that these Romans should
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.680]   have a full assurance of their salvation, that they should know that whatever might
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:23.360]   happen to them, that all things work together for good to those who are Christian.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.000]   God overrules everything, it doesn't matter what happens.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.280]   Everything is overruled by God for the good and for the benefit of his people.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.200]   And these are further described as those who love God, and they are further described as
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.360]   those who are the called according to his purpose.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.320]   Now then, the theme is that the ultimate and the final source of assurance of salvation
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.720]   is that we are in this purpose of God.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.360]   We have had many other arguments to give us assurance in this chapter, but here we rise
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.600]   to the topmost level.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:13.680]   It is the purpose of God that we should be brought to a state of final and complete salvation
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.680]   and entire deliverance from sin and from evil.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.340]   Very well, so the great point is this purpose of God.
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.600]   And what he has told us is, we have been considering this, that the purpose of God for us is that
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:39.040]   we should be made conformable to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.480]   among many brethren.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.920]   Now you see therefore that there are two aspects to this great eternal purpose of God.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.160]   We have already dealt with the first, and that is God's purpose with respect to us,
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.320]   that we might be conformed to the image of his Son, that we might become brethren of
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.760]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.440]   He is the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.160]   We become his brothers, and he is not ashamed to call us brothers.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.160]   That is it.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.320]   And another way of putting it we saw was that we are eventually going to be glorified, and
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.120]   that is a state of complete and entire perfection.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.780]   We shall see him as he is, and we shall be like him.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.120]   That is ultimate glorification.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.960]   Well now, we have been considering all that, and we have seen that that is God's purpose
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.240]   for us.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.820]   Nothing less, nothing short.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.280]   We must never stop at any point short of final glorification.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.880]   God has not merely purposed that we should be forgiven and given a chance of carrying
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.120]   on and ultimately arriving there.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.120]   No, no.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.040]   God has purposed our final glorification.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.040]   He has purposed the whole of it, the final step as well as the first step.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.880]   That is the whole argument of the apostle.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.200]   I mean, there is no assurance apart from that.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.320]   To be started off in something without having a guarantee that it is going to finish does
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.000]   not give me any assurance at all.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.840]   It gives me a chance, but it does not give me assurance.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.280]   Paul is concerned to give assurance.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.440]   So he says that the purpose is nothing less than that, that we might be conformed to the
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.340]   image of his Son.
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.880]   We might be glorified.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.760]   Very well.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.960]   Now then, we move on to the second aspect of this great purpose of God.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:46.760]   We were just hinting at it as we closed the last time we met together on the 15th of December.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.240]   And it is this, of course, the second aspect of God's purpose, as referenced to the Son
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:02.040]   himself, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.040]   Now this term, firstborn, of course, leads us at once to the key to what the apostle
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.040]   is saying.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.960]   The firstborn is always in a position of preeminence.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.440]   That was a great characteristic of family life in Israel, as you all know.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:25.660]   The firstborn was always in a very special and unique position of privilege, and unusual
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.160]   respect had to be paid to him.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.240]   And so the apostle puts it like this, that the glory of the Son is shown in the fact
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:42.240]   that he is to be the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.560]   Now it's very important that we should look at our salvation from that standpoint.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.560]   Not only think of it in terms of ourselves, but we've got to see that God's ultimate
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:05.240]   object of all, in ever planning and bringing in the whole scheme of salvation, is to glorify
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.880]   his Son.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.160]   We've already had occasion to emphasize this aspect of the matter in previous expositions,
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.000]   but here we are compelled to do so.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.800]   We must realize, and there's nothing so comforting as this, nothing so assuring, that the whole
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:32.960]   matter of the honor and the glory of the blessed Holy Trinity is involved in our ultimate,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.920]   complete salvation.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.120]   The whole purpose of salvation is to glorify the Son of God.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.620]   He is the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.880]   Can you conceive of what the position would be if suddenly he had no brethren at all,
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.880]   nobody to follow him?
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.720]   He's left heaven, he's come on earth, he's given his teaching, he's died on the cross,
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.320]   he's been buried, he's risen again, and there's nobody following him.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.040]   Where would the glory of the Son be?
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.520]   There would be none, it would be disgrace, it would be failure.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.080]   Well now the apostle, you see, wants us to see this.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.120]   As God's ultimate purpose is to show forth the preeminence of his Son, and to glorify
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:25.520]   the Son, as our Lord himself, you remember, emphasized so much in his high priestly prayer,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.160]   which is recorded in the 17th chapter of John's Gospel, so the apostle is putting it here.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.800]   You say, well, we can look at it therefore like this.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:39.160]   Here is the ultimate of all guarantees of our final salvation.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.400]   The glory of the Son is involved in this.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:51.480]   And he is finally glorified when he and all his brethren are there, as it were, on view
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.880]   to the whole cosmos, the whole universe.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.080]   Now that's the way in which the apostle puts it.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:05.400]   And of course it is a theme with which all who are familiar with the New Testament epistles
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.720]   will be quite familiar.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:13.600]   Now I read that portion from Ephesians 1 just now for this reason, that there again the
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.440]   same point of course is brought out.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.320]   Take for instance the 10th verse.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.280]   Here, according to the apostle, is the whole object of salvation.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.320]   In verse 9 he introduces it saying, "Having made known unto us the mystery of his will,
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.840]   according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself, this is God."
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.840]   What is it?
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.840]   Well, here it is.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   "That in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he, God, might gather together or
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:49.440]   head up again in one all things in Christ, both which are in him and which are on earth,
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.800]   even in him."
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   The whole cosmos is, you see, to be headed up again in one, in utter absolute perfection,
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.680]   but it's in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:07.000]   And so at the end of the chapter again, you notice how he pointed out that God having
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.520]   raised him from the dead, he set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:18.360]   above all principalities and power and might and dominion and every name that is named
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.240]   not only in this world but also in that which is to come.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.240]   There it is.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:29.080]   You see, he's above all and everything as the result of this work which he's done.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:34.480]   But perhaps the most explicit statement of this is the one that is found in Philippians
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.520]   2, the famous passage about our Lord's humiliation.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.720]   Beginning you remember in verse 5, "Let this mind be in you," which was also in Christ
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.920]   Jesus, "who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:56.480]   himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.720]   likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.000]   unto death, even the death of the cross."
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.120]   Listen, "Wherefore, wherefore, God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:21.880]   is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, and every tongue, every
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:27.120]   knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth, and every
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:34.360]   tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.320]   But don't forget the "wherefore."
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.760]   You see, it's the result of what he's done.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.640]   In other words, that is the ultimate object of salvation, that the Son might be set in
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:51.760]   this position, that at his name every knee should bow of things in heaven and things
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:57.320]   in earth and things under the earth, and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ, this
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.280]   is the name that he's been given.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.280]   He's high and over all.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.320]   It is the glory of the Son.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.000]   And again the apostle puts it in writing to the Colossians, in the first chapter and verse
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.920]   18.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.760]   Writing about our Lord, he says, "And he is the head of the body, the church, who is
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:27.160]   the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence."
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.240]   That's it.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:37.000]   The preeminence of the Son of God, the firstborn from among the dead, the firstborn among many
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.280]   brethren.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.720]   So he says, "Behold me and the children which thou hast given me."
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.520]   He is the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.640]   The ultimate end and object of salvation is the glorification of the Son.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:12:01.800]   Well now, the argument you see is this, that because that is the ultimate object of salvation,
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.520]   it is absolutely certain and safe and sure.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.520]   It can't fail.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.520]   It can't go wrong.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:15.680]   Everything God has purposed in and through his Son must be fully successful, ultimately
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.680]   triumphant.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:25.840]   Well, if you and I are in this purpose, therefore, that is the guarantee of our ultimate glorification.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.440]   We are to be glorified with the Son and to be made like him.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:40.200]   And thus God is going to honour him through what he does to us and in us and in our salvation.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.200]   Well now, that's a very important thing for us to remember.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.360]   But now we can move on.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:54.560]   There we've been dealing with this purpose, who are the called according to his purpose.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.960]   And there you have the two sides of the purpose, which really merge, of course, into one and
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:05.840]   ultimately become the same thing, except that we give him always the preeminence as the
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.000]   firstborn.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.320]   But now, having stated the purpose, the apostle, as it were, in order to make this thing, if
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:24.720]   possible, still more sure to us, goes on to show us in detail how God has put this purpose
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:32.920]   into operation, how he's put it into practice, what he has done and is doing and is going
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:38.480]   to do in order to carry out this great purpose of his.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.320]   You see, what he's anxious to show you is this, that God's purpose, because he is God,
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.520]   is perfect in every respect.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:51.440]   Perfect as a thought, as a concept, perfect in its inception, equally perfect in being
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.920]   carried out in every stage.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.320]   When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.240]   The time was known, known only to God at the exact moment the Son of God came.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.960]   That's why prophecy was possible, and exact prophecy was possible in the Old Testament.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.240]   You see, it's all perfect.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:15.320]   Everything that had been prophesied was fulfilled down to the smallest detail, of course.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.640]   And the Son himself was perfect, never sinned, all he did was perfect.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.640]   Everything is perfect.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.660]   The carrying out of the purpose is perfect.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:28.460]   We see that in the Son himself and all that happened to him when he was here on earth.
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:33.040]   Everything that had been predicted and prophesied and promised was carried out in every single
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.040]   detail.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:42.120]   That's, says Paul, but it's equally true in the application of what he worked out and
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:47.660]   achieved to those to whom it applies.
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:52.240]   And now that's the thing he takes up here in verse 29.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.240]   And you notice he introduces it with the word "for."
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.560]   This word, as I've had occasion to point out many times before, is always an important
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.120]   word, but it's a crucially important word here.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:09.840]   "For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate."
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:15.040]   Why does he say "for whom he did foreknow"?
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:24.920]   Well this is just his way of pointing out to us how every step, every part, every particle
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:31.280]   of this great purpose of God has been worked out in detail.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.800]   That there's nothing contingent about what God does.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.320]   He saw it all, he planned it all at the beginning, and there is a sense in which he did it all
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.360]   at the beginning, before the very foundation of the world.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:48.520]   "For," he says, you see he hasn't left it uncertain at all.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.680]   I want you to know how sure this purpose is.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:57.920]   "For whom he did foreknow," with respect to this purpose, he did predestinate, and
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.920]   so on and so on.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.920]   Very well.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:07.480]   Now then, here we come to the inevitable carrying out in detail, and every detail in perfection,
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.760]   of this glorious, eternal purpose of God.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:18.520]   And you notice that it consists of five steps.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:28.800]   Foreknowledge, predestination, calling, justification, glorification.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:36.840]   Now here we've got our five steps, essential steps, in the carrying out of this purpose
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.880]   of God, with regard to our salvation and the glorification of his Son.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:50.520]   Or if you like, God's purpose of glorifying his Son in and through the plan of salvation
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.840]   or of redemption.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:17:02.220]   And he singles out five steps, every one of which is absolutely vital.
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.340]   Now you notice the order in which he puts them.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:11.760]   That again is an extremely important matter, and a very interesting matter.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.680]   Five steps, I say.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:19.000]   And they can be very conveniently arranged like this.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.920]   You notice that there is one at the center, with two on each side.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.080]   And the one in the center is the calling.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.180]   On the one side of the calling you've got the foreknowledge and the predestination.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.360]   On the other side of the calling you've got the justification and the glorification.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.560]   That's a very good way of looking at it.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.600]   The apostle undoubtedly deliberately put them in that order.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.280]   Now I do want to emphasize that, that the order is not accidental, it's not haphazard.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.360]   He didn't put them down as they occurred to him.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.720]   This is the order.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.980]   This is the order in the mind of God.
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:59.660]   This is the way in which God proceeded to put the thing that he purposed and planned
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.940]   into operation.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:09.480]   And it's a very definite logical order, which is most important for us.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:19.200]   Now the first two, you notice, have a reference to what God has determined and decided with
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.840]   respect to us.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.740]   The last two, the second two, the justification and the glorification, have a more practical
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:33.280]   and immediate reference to what is done to us.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.660]   And what the calling does, which is in the middle, is to act as a kind of connecting
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.660]   link.
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:44.560]   It is as if we're as if some great machine.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.620]   You must have observed on the docks, or in connection with these buildings, they have
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:54.480]   these great grabs, which are manipulated.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:00.200]   And suddenly this grab comes down and takes hold of something, and it lifts it up.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.200]   Well now, that's the calling.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:10.040]   Here is the plan, the machinery, if you like, and here are we, and suddenly down comes this
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.360]   which takes hold of us.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.640]   It's a scriptural term.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:19.520]   Paul says that he was apprehended, he was laid hold of, he was grabbed, if you like.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.240]   And then what happens as the result of that grabbing, laying hold of, is justification,
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.240]   glorification.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:31.240]   So that it is very convenient to look at it in that way, that the calling is the point
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:41.800]   at which all this, as it were, becomes actual in us, becomes practical and applied to us.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:47.440]   Well now then, let's have a look at these great steps as they're outlined here.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:53.480]   I trust that nobody has forgotten all I was saying at the end of November and the beginning
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:59.000]   of December about the right way to approach this subject.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.360]   That there's never a time when it's more important to observe our spirits and our hearts
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.000]   than when we're dealing with these great terms.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   There's nothing so tragic in the whole history of the Church as the way in which a passage
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:20.680]   like this has been abused and has become the matter oftentimes of heated, bad-tempered,
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.120]   foolish controversy.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.840]   Let us remember that we are dealing with the mind and the purpose of God.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:35.280]   And let us come with humility and look at what the apostle lays before us.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.200]   Now then, the terms.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.720]   The first is the term "for no."
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.560]   For whom he did "for no."
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.920]   Here's the first term.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.880]   And let me say it's not only the first.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.520]   It is the crucial term.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.640]   It is the most important term of all.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.640]   Obviously.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.480]   There is the purpose of God.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.080]   Here are we in sin.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:11.640]   Now then, the question is, how does the plan and purpose of God with regard to the glorification
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:17.520]   of his Son in redemption, what is the first move in our direction?
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:22.760]   The answer is "for knowledge."
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.240]   Whom he did "for knowledge."
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.240]   What's it mean?
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:37.040]   Now in all this matter and this high doctrine, this is the most important and the crucial
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.920]   term.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.080]   It's always interesting to me that people don't realize that.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.960]   They think the great term is predestination.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.960]   It isn't.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.960]   It's the second.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   It isn't the first.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960]   This is the first.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.880]   You always hear people talking about predestination and election.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.320]   For knowledge is the thing that comes first.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.320]   It must do.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.320]   What's it mean?
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:06.560]   Well, the actual meaning of the word, of course, means to know beforehand.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.600]   For knowledge.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:16.920]   That's it from the mere standpoint of linguistics, language.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:23.760]   There's a popular method of biblical exposition today which seems to turn to the dictionaries
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.760]   when reading the scripture.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.560]   Well, all right, up to a point it's all right, but if you stop at your dictionary,
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.000]   well all I can say is God help you.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.440]   The dictionaries are not meant to deal with these matters except in that purely linguistic
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440]   manner.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.600]   And for knowledge means knowing beforehand.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.000]   Well but what does this mean?
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.840]   Now here you see, you arrive at the difficulty.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.760]   There are those who say, well it just means this.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.320]   God is omniscient.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.600]   God knows everything.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.440]   There is nothing which God doesn't know.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:10.160]   And because God has omniscience, he also has, therefore, of necessity, prescience.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.680]   If he knows everything and there's no time where God is, there's no past, present, and
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:19.880]   future, but God knows all and everything at the same time, well then from our angle it
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:27.640]   obviously follows that God knows things beforehand, before they happen, because he knows everything.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:33.840]   And they say that all that is meant here is that God, because he's God, knows what is
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.720]   going to happen beforehand.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:44.560]   And then they go further, and they say this, that God knows beforehand that some people
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.040]   are going to believe the gospel.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:53.080]   And that he, because he knows beforehand, because he did know beforehand who these people
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:58.520]   were who were going to believe the gospel, he therefore predestinated them to be conformed
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.240]   to the image of Islam.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:06.600]   But that's all it means, they say, that God simply knew beforehand who these people were
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.000]   who were going to believe.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:17.760]   Well now, we must obviously deal with this, and show the utter inadequacy of such an explanation
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.160]   of this term.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:27.080]   To start with, the passage, the statement does not say that God knew beforehand what
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.920]   somebody was going to do.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.480]   It's talking entirely about God and what he does.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.960]   There's no reference here at all to what you and I or anybody else may or may not do.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:45.000]   All the statements as I've shown you are what God does, whom he did foreknow, he did also
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.520]   predestine, moreover whom he predestinated, them he also called, and whom he called, them
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.720]   he also justified, and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.300]   It's all the action of God.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:01.800]   So it's a pure introduction of something which isn't here at all, to introduce anything that
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.640]   you or I may or may not do.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.400]   However, that's merely a preliminary observation.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.040]   The way to approach it is surely this.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.840]   Take this term, this word, foreknow.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.120]   This is a word that is used seven times in the New Testament.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:24.480]   The word which is used here is used on six other occasions in the New Testament, seven
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.640]   altogether, including this one.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:36.000]   Twice it is used of the foreknowledge of man, and the other five times, including this one,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.680]   it is used with respect to God himself.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.520]   And this one, of course, as I say, is with respect to God.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:49.400]   Therefore, surely an interesting and a right thing to do when you're dealing with a difficult
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:56.960]   problem is to look up the other uses of this very expression, this same word.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.960]   Let me do so with you.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:03.200]   The first you will find in the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, in
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.600]   verse 23.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   Now here Peter is preaching on the day of Pentecost to the Jews in Jerusalem, and he
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.480]   is telling them about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.480]   "Ye men of Israel, hear these words.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.400]   Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:32.400]   God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know, him"—listen—"being
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:37.520]   delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God."
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.600]   There's your word.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.360]   And you notice that it's coupled with determinate counsel.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.200]   Same essential meaning as predestination here.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.160]   "Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:58.000]   taken him by wicked hands, and crucified and slain."
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.040]   Now then, what does foreknowledge mean there?
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:09.920]   Is Peter just telling them that God knew from eternity that the Lord Jesus Christ was going
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.920]   to be crucified?
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.360]   What's the point of saying that?
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.160]   There's no point in saying it.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:21.560]   What he's telling these people is this, that Christ died on the cross because God
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.000]   had sent him to that death.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.280]   That was the thing that was planned.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.440]   "You've actually done it," he says, "and you've employed wicked men to do it.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.400]   You have taken him by wicked hands, and crucified and slain."
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.680]   But it was the predeterminate counsel and foreknowledge of God that brought the thing
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.920]   to pass.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.360]   And then you'll find that the same thing is repeated in the fourth chapter of Acts.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.840]   Now don't misunderstand me.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:51.360]   The word foreknowledge is not used in what I'm about to quote now, but it's the same
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.360]   idea.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.680]   Listen to this.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:28:03.040]   In Acts 4, verses 27 and 28, "For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:08.480]   anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:16.800]   gathered together, for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.560]   be done."
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:25.960]   All these men were acting under the ultimate decision and determination of God.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:33.800]   They were simply doing what thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:40.000]   In other words, the teaching is that the death of the Lord Jesus Christ was something that
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.440]   was planned by God before the foundation of the world.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.520]   His death was not an accident.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.400]   He came into the world in order to die.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.240]   He came to taste death for every man.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.600]   He came to be the Lamb of God.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:01.080]   And this is how the Bible says that, that it has all happened according to the predeterminate
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.440]   counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.720]   So foreknowledge means foreordination.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.720]   It's in that sense that it's known that God ordained this.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.480]   This is the thing he saw that he was going to do.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.360]   That's what it means.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.520]   The two terms go together.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:27.200]   Now it's very interesting to notice the different translations on this.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:35.440]   Even the New English Bible puts it like this, Acts 2, 23, it puts it like this, "Him being
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:43.880]   delivered by the deliberate will and plan of God."
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:49.840]   You see, they have to put it like that, "the deliberate will and plan of God."
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:55.520]   Another one puts it like this, "Delivered by the predestined course of God's deliberate
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.360]   purpose."
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.960]   It means an ordination.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:07.160]   And never forget in reading Acts 2, 23, that the word "determinate" governs the counsel
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.040]   and the foreknowledge.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.960]   It was determinate counsel, it was determinate foreknowledge.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:19.280]   The two, the determinate governs the two.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:25.080]   It's a very interesting point in the correct understanding of the original Greek.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.240]   Well very well then, what it says is, not merely that God had knowledge that when he
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.720]   sent his son into the world that men would kill him.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.920]   No, no, it means infinitely more, thank God.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:41.960]   It means that he came in order that that might happen to him, because if that did not happen
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.840]   to him, there would be no salvation at all.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.000]   That is God's way of making salvation.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:57.200]   By laying the sins upon his son, he becomes the Lamb of God, slain from the foundation
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.200]   of the world.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.520]   Very well, there's our first instance.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:08.200]   Then the second is the very one we're looking at together, in Romans 8, 29.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:13.040]   But then the next is again in the epistle to the Romans, but this time in chapter 11
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:19.680]   and in verse 2, where Paul has this argument, you remember, about the Jews.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.800]   I say then, "Hath God cast away his people?
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   God forbid.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:30.200]   For I also am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham and of the tribe of Benjamin.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:35.280]   God hath not cast away his people whom he foreknew."
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:42.360]   Now, you see, there's only one possible meaning to that, isn't there?
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.800]   What does it mean by foreknew?
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.080]   Does it mean that he foreknew that they were going to fall away?
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.600]   Well, no, that's not what he's saying at all.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:58.760]   He's saying, "Look here, God hath not cast away his people whom he has chosen, whom
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.760]   he has foreordained in this respect."
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.200]   Read the chapter for yourself, you'll see that's the whole argument.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.840]   It isn't merely saying that he knew certain things about them, certain things that they
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.840]   were going to do.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.360]   There's no argument there.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:16.520]   The argument is that it's inconceivable that God having chosen people should then
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.520]   cast them away.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.080]   That can't happen.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.520]   That's the argument.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:26.960]   And it's the same word as we've got in Romans 8, 29, foreknew, exactly the same
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:27.960]   point.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:34.480]   Then we go on to the next example, which is in the first epistle of Peter, in the first
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.520]   chapter and the second verse.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.480]   Now let's read this.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.200]   I must go back to the first verse again.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.000]   Well, no, the second will do.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:50.400]   He's writing to the strangers scattered abroad, "Elect according to the full knowledge
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:59.920]   of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.160]   of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.240]   Grace unto you and peace be multiplied."
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.600]   Now he says, "You're Christian people, and because you're Christian people, this
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.760]   is what is true of you.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.320]   You have been elected."
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.320]   How?
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:18.200]   Well, according to the foreknowledge of God.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.320]   Through?
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:24.080]   He works it out by using the Holy Spirit to set you apart.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.280]   That's what sanctify means there.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.240]   Sanctification of the Spirit doesn't mean that they become sanctified, but that they've
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.600]   been set apart unto what?
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.800]   Well unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.920]   The obedience of faith and the sprinkling with the blood of Christ, which assures them
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.280]   their pardon and their forgiveness and their true reconciliation to God.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:48.440]   Well now, there again is an example of the same word.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.560]   Now let me give you here again the New English Bible.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:59.480]   Chosen of old, in the purpose of God the Father.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.120]   That's how they translate foreknowledge, their purpose.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.120]   And they're quite right.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.120]   Perfectly right.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:08.240]   It is in the purpose of the Father.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.640]   The foreknowledge is the purpose.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.360]   This is what is purpose.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.000]   So they translate it by "in the purpose of God the Father."
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.720]   The Revised Standard Version, the American Revised Standard Version, puts it like this.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.160]   "Destinedly."
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.760]   They bring in that word instead of foreknowledge.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.760]   That is "destined."
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.760]   "Destinedly."
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.280]   All right, there it is in 1 Peter 1.2.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:39.560]   But then come to a most interesting example, the last, which is in 1 Peter 1.20.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.840]   Now listen to this one.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.400]   Let's go back again, just to introduce it.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.440]   He's talking about how we've been saved.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:54.800]   So he says in verse 19 that we have been saved with the precious blood of Christ, as of a
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:35:06.280]   lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was foreordained before the foundation
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:14.000]   of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.960]   Now you notice I'm reading here the Authorized Translation.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.100]   Who verily was foreordained.
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:25.000]   But what's the word that Paul used, which is here translated foreordained?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.680]   It's the same word, foreknowledge.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:33.480]   Now you see, our good friends of the Authorized Version were utterly inconsistent with themselves.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:38.320]   Here they very rightly translate it as foreordained.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.000]   And they should have done the same thing everywhere else.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.520]   They're not consistent with themselves.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.520]   Why did they do it here?
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.880]   Well, because it's obvious it couldn't possibly be anything else.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:56.880]   He's talking about Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was foreknown
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.000]   as the Lamb of God before the foundation of the world.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.560]   Yes, but that's almost a ridiculous thing to say.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:10.600]   You can't possibly say that God, because he knows everything, knew before the foundation
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.280]   of the world that his Son was going to be the Lamb of God.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.280]   That isn't the truth.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:21.120]   The truth is that it was God who made him the Lamb of God.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.760]   It is God who foreordained him.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:29.100]   He knew him in that sense, that he specially set him apart for that work.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:35.040]   So you see, there's only one sense and one meaning to foreknowledge, and that is foreordained,
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.040]   foreordination.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.360]   Now it's a very interesting thing.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:44.840]   I've looked up I don't know how many translations, and however much they may disagree and go
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:48.880]   wrong with the other four, they're all absolutely unanimous here.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.360]   Revised standard version.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:54.560]   Or take the New English Bible first.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:59.960]   It says here he was predestined before the foundation of the world.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:06.320]   This very word foreknowledge, he was predestined before the foundation of the world, but was
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.960]   manifest in these last times.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.640]   The thing was settled and decided upon there before the foundation of the world.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.760]   But it's only been done, it's been made manifest now.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.360]   That's the contrast.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.640]   Now there you are, he was predestined.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.720]   Revised standard version.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.760]   He was destined before the foundation of the world.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.560]   Weymouth, he was predestined.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.560]   Now they're all agreed about it.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:36.720]   Here in 1 Peter 1.20, they're all unanimously agreed because it is so perfectly plain and
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.440]   obvious that it couldn't possibly be anything else.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:45.120]   Well now then, there I've put some evidence before you.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.520]   But we can go further than that.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:56.120]   Take this word "to know" as it is used in the Bible with respect to God's relationship
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.680]   to human beings.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:04.160]   It always has a very special meaning.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:11.120]   It cannot mean only the knowledge of omniscience, because if it only meant that, we could say
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.120]   this.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:16.600]   God knows everything.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.280]   He knows all people.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.440]   There is no person whom God doesn't know.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.240]   There is no person about whom God doesn't know from the foundation of the world everything
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.560]   about him, all he's going to do and all he's going to say.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:35.720]   That is universal, because God is omniscient.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:40.400]   Well therefore, it can't possibly mean here that God simply knows beforehand what people
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.520]   are going to do, because he knows that about everybody.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:47.560]   But here the apostle is only talking about certain special people, these people who love
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:52.740]   God, who are the called according to his purpose.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:56.860]   So there is obviously something special about it, and there is.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:01.040]   When it is said in the scripture that God knows somebody, it means that he has a special
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.800]   interest in them.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.160]   It means that he has set his love upon them.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.800]   It means that he is planning and purposing certain things with respect to them.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:13.960]   Now let me give you the classical statements with respect to this.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.240]   They must be familiar to you.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:22.840]   The best of all is perhaps in Amos, the prophet Amos chapter 3 and verse 2.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:29.780]   God says to the children of Israel, "You only have I known of all the families of the
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:35.280]   earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities."
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:39.360]   You only have I known of all the families of the earth.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.700]   But God knows, in the matter of knowledge, every family in the earth.
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:47.540]   But he says here, "It is because I've only known you that I'm going to punish you for
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.540]   your iniquities."
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:49.540]   What's it mean?
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.980]   Well, it doesn't just mean that he knows about them and knows what they're going to
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.060]   do and not going to do.
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.980]   It means you only have I given special attention to.
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.300]   You only have I selected as my own people.
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:06.900]   You are the only ones on whom I've set my heart and to whom I've given special treatment.
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.300]   You alone.
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:12.860]   Therefore, I'm going to punish you in an exceptional manner.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:18.200]   Now there is the crucial statement with respect to it, but let me give you a kind of parallel
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:24.220]   on the negative from the New Testament in Matthew 7, 23 at the end of the Sermon on
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.220]   the Mount.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.220]   You remember?
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:29.860]   Our Lord puts it like this.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:34.180]   He says that "Many will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:39.780]   thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?'
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:47.140]   And then will I profess unto them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.'"
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:52.060]   Well if it's just a question of knowledge in the sense of omniscience and prescience,
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.580]   there's no meaning, there's no sense.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.660]   He says "I never knew you," by which he means this.
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.460]   You've never belonged to me.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:01.340]   You've never been my people.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:07.300]   You've never been in this peculiar relationship in which I say that I knew you.
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.180]   It's the only conceivable meaning.
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:15.900]   That is the common meaning which is attached to this knowledge of God, of people, as used
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:16.900]   in the Bible.
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:22.340]   And now there's a translation which I feel therefore puts this matter in Romans 8, 29
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.340]   very well.
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.180]   The translation of Charles Williams, an American.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:28.180]   He puts it like this.
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:36.140]   "For those on whom he set his heart beforehand, he also did predestine it to be conformed
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.580]   to the image of his Son."
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:44.540]   And Charles Williams points out in a footnote what is apparently the simple truth from a
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:52.260]   purely scholastic point of view, that that is the meaning which is always attached in
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:57.100]   the Septuagint to this word about foreknowledge.
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:04.540]   Invariably, he says, in the Septuagint, the shade of meaning which is given to the word
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:11.140]   is that "those on whom he has set his heart beforehand."
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.140]   Very well.
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:16.260]   Well now then, just to leave it for this evening.
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:24.460]   To my great interest, I found that even Moffat, who rejects the doctrine of course, and with
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:30.900]   him C. H. Dodd, who equally rejects the doctrine, both of them have got to translate it like
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:31.900]   this.
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:40.860]   "He decreed of old that those whom he predestined should be conformed to the image of his Son."
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:44.220]   Even Moffat and Dodd have to translate it like that.
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:53.220]   He decreed of old that those whom he predestined should be conformed to the image of his Son.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:58.220]   And let me say this for both of them, they carried that translation through quite consistently
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:06.940]   in chapter 11, verse 2, and in 1 Peter 1.2 and 1 Peter 1.20.
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:11.540]   Therefore I conclude that the meaning is this.
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:19.260]   It's the same thing as we have God saying to the children of Israel in Deuteronomy 7.7,
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:24.260]   "The Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you, because ye were more in number
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:29.780]   than any other people, for ye were fewest of all people, but because the Lord loved
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.620]   you."
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:35.660]   That's why, you see, we are told that he set his love upon them.
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:45.380]   Or take it in Jeremiah 31.3, "Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love; therefore,
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:49.300]   with lovingkindness have I drawn thee."
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:53.560]   He drew them because he had loved them with an everlasting love.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:57.860]   The everlasting love wherewith he had loved them was the reason why he proceeded to draw
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:58.860]   them.
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:01.300]   Nothing in them, it is his everlasting love.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:07.700]   Now that is the consistent teaching of the Bible, both in the Old Testament and in the
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.700]   New.
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.620]   So foreknowledge means this.
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:22.460]   God setting his love upon and ordaining and determining certain things for these people.
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:30.260]   Indeed, there is very little difference between foreknowledge and predestination.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:36.300]   And that is why you will almost invariably find the two words going together as we've
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:41.060]   seen tonight in Acts 2.23 and here and in other places.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.900]   The shade of difference in the meaning is just that.
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:51.220]   That God first of all sets his heart on the people and then immediately, because it's
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:56.580]   God, it's at the same time, determines to do certain things to them.
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:03.140]   That will lead us next time, God willing, to the meaning of the term predestination.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.140]   Well there it is.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:09.140]   There is the first great, crucial, all-important word.
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:18.340]   "For whom he did foreknow in his purpose, he also did predestine it to be conformed
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.940]   to the image of his Son," and so on.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:27.460]   Well may God give us grace to meditate seriously and solemnly and lovingly upon this great
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:28.460]   word.
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:33.980]   What it tells us is this, that if you and I are lovers of God, if we are called according
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:43.660]   to his purpose, he knew us before the foundation of the world.
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:47.400]   Not only before we were born, but before the foundation of the world.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:55.820]   He knew us and decided and determined these things concerning us.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:01.980]   Can you conceive of any greater assurance than just that?
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:05.700]   But lest somebody may say, "Very well, then I can go out and sin as much as I like."
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:06.700]   Can you?
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:11.500]   What he tells you is this, that God knew you in this way, that he then determined that
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:21.580]   you and I were going to be made conformable to the image of his Son, free from sin, utterly,
[00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:24.580]   absolutely glorified.
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.060]   Amen.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:36.740]   O Lord, our God, we cannot but thank thee as we come to thee once more that thou hast
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:44.020]   ever been pleased to tell us these things and to state them to us.
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:51.140]   O God, we thank thee that thou dost stoop to our level to grant us this blessed assurance
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.140]   and certainty.
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:59.680]   We are amazed, O God, that thou hast ever troubled about us to this extent, but we humbly
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:04.980]   thank thee for it and rejoice in thy presence.
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:12.220]   Teach us, O God, to rejoice with trembling as we are thus given a glimpse into thine
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:19.060]   own eternal mind and purpose before the very foundation of the world.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:25.460]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God, the fellowship and the
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:32.020]   communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout the remainder
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:39.460]   of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall be
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:46.460]   finally glorified and like him in the glory.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.000]   Amen.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.900]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
