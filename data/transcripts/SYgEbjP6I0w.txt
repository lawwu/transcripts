[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Hey everyone, this is Tony.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   Well you can pop a confetti popper because on Saturday, this Saturday, this podcast turns
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.000]   seven years old.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.160]   Amazing.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.760]   No presents please.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.600]   You already make it possible through your prayers and financial support over the years.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.160]   Thank you for supporting us and if you want to celebrate with us, here's how.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.160]   We put together a brief online survey that takes just a few minutes to fill out and it'll
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.780]   be up until the end of January.
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:35.000]   We want you to help us make this podcast better for the next seven years ahead, Lord willing.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.080]   To do that, tell us what you like, tell us what you don't like, and to do that, go online
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.840]   to DesiringGod.org/survey.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.040]   That's DesiringGod.org/survey.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.240]   And I'll mention this address again at the end of today's episode, which starts right
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.320]   now.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.120]   We have a culture question from a pastor who asks this.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.120]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.360]   In a recent TGC podcast, Sam Albury said the following thing about campus outreach ministry.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.880]   He said this, "People have often thought Christianity was a bit quaint.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.040]   You know, there, there, you've got your little faith kind of thing.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.320]   But increasingly, what we're seeing in a more secular context is people saying to us is
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.420]   actually your faith is a danger to society.
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.720]   And that's new space for us and we're not used to being looked down on and slightly
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.720]   patronized.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.240]   I don't think we're used to feeling like we are the enemy.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.920]   People used to say, I don't like Christianity because it's too moral.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.040]   Now they're saying, I don't like Christianity because it's too immoral.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.520]   And whether it's people saying Christianity is responsible for gay teenagers committing
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.320]   suicide or for fostering intolerance, those arguments carry far more emotional force than
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.640]   some of the previous objections I would have dealt with 10 or 15 years ago."
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.880]   So here's my question, Pastor John.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.920]   Christianity started out as a powerful minority voice in culture, but at times in history
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.200]   and today in America, evangelicalism is a major cultural voice and possibly a deciding
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.980]   factor in the 2020 presidential election.
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.680]   So how do we respond as the tide turns and we hear criticisms coming our way that American
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.920]   Christianity is a bully, using its political and social sway for ends that the world says
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.880]   are mean, immoral, and even hateful?
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.720]   I don't presume to have the last word on these complex matters, but I realize also that I
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.120]   don't have the luxury of saying nothing or thinking nothing because I live in this very
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.440]   embattled world as a Christian whose citizenship is in heaven, in allegiance to King Jesus
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:53.200]   first and foremost, and whose authoritative life charter is the Bible, not the U.S. Constitution,
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.920]   and who has already died.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:03.040]   I have already died, and my life is hidden with Christ in God, and yet I live a bodily
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.920]   life here as an exile and sojourner.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.480]   So I don't feel like I have the luxury of saying nothing, and yet I speak very much
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.960]   as an alien.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.720]   So I have three things, three kinds of responses to this kind of question and this situation
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.080]   in which we find ourselves.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.120]   The first is to say that what seems new for Christian experience is not new.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.520]   I mean, the pastor, in a sense, said that, and I want to underline it.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.840]   What we're experiencing is new, and a shift of attitude towards Christianity is not new.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.440]   The second thing I want to say, and I'll circle back to these, is to say that the biblical
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.960]   position on controversial social and cultural issues is not immoral, it's not harmful, it's
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.920]   not unloving, no matter what the culture says to the opposite.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.360]   And the third thing I want to say is that our political voice should be so permeated
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:13.180]   by the announcement of the horrors of divine wrath over the human race and the glories
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.920]   of the gospel of divine rescue and the unsearchable riches of Christ, the ruler of the nations,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.980]   and the demand for repentance and faith from every citizen and every politician, so permeated
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.940]   with all that, that it is evident to all that political concerns for the true Christian
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:41.300]   fade into mists compared to these vastly greater realities.
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.460]   So those are the three things that I want to say, and let me go back now and say just
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.700]   a word about each one of them.
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.100]   So there are three things.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.860]   Here's number one.
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:59.320]   For the people of God to be regarded as immoral and dangerous is not new.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.420]   We get the impression that it's new because for about 300 years, we've lived in a peculiar
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.380]   aberration in the history of the world called America.
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.780]   Far more biblically normal is what we read in the New Testament.
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:24.340]   The Jewish leader said of Jesus, "If we let him go on like this, the Romans will come
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.180]   and take away our place and our nation," John 11, 48.
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.700]   In other words, this man is very dangerous.
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.580]   We can't let him talk anymore like this.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.700]   And the same thing was said about the early Christians.
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:43.620]   The public accusation in Thessalonica was that these men have turned the world upside
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.420]   down, Acts 17, 6.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:51.940]   And they were—they're acting—these men are acting against the decrees of Caesar,
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.860]   which meant they are calling up down and down up and good bad and bad good, and they're
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.100]   going to wreck our good Roman world.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.380]   So that's not new.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:09.900]   Jesus was called the devil, and Matthew warned that if they called the master of the house
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.900]   the devil, they're going to call us worse things, Matthew 10, 25.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.660]   And at the end of Paul's life, the Jews in Rome said, "Well, we've heard about
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.740]   this sect, Christianity, and it is spoken against everywhere."
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:31.220]   Like not here and there, like everywhere, this thing called Christianity, we hear it's
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.460]   spoken against, Acts 28, 22.
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.140]   And Peter warned that even though you're doing good deeds, they're going to speak
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.500]   against you as evildoers, 1 Peter 2, 12.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.700]   So they're going to twist our good deeds and make them sound like evil deeds.
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.860]   This is not new.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.220]   It's normal.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.940]   It's been the case from the beginning that Christians are slandered, and one of the worst
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:02.100]   slanders is to consider our love dangerous.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.980]   Here's the second thing.
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:10.340]   The biblical position on controversial social, cultural issues is not immoral, it's not
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.060]   harmful, it's not unloving.
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:19.060]   To say out loud that there is no such thing as so-called gay marriage, because God has
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:25.460]   created and defined marriage as a covenanted life together of a man and a woman, to say
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.300]   that out loud is not immoral.
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.420]   It's not unloving.
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:36.940]   It's true, it's moral, it's loving, because God knows what is best for the world, and
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:43.620]   therefore it is self-destructive and treasonous to tell him or to tell people that he doesn't
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.740]   know what he's talking about and to try to celebrate what the opposite is, namely,
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.740]   abomination.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:56.460]   And the same is true of speaking out loud about biological men trying to be women or
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:01.980]   women trying to be men, and boys and girls should not be assisted in becoming what they
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.020]   are not nor ever can be.
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:10.100]   And the same is true in saying out loud that God has issued commands against racism and
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:15.060]   against killing unborn children and against political swagger and dozens of other marks
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.980]   of modern America.
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:24.940]   It's not harmful or unloving or immoral to stand up and say the commands of our Creator
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:31.740]   are good for us, not harmful, and the path of repentance and faith in Christ and obedience
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:37.220]   to his Word is the path of life and joy.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.220]   That's not immoral.
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.400]   It doesn't matter what the world says.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.420]   What matters is what is the actual case.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.580]   And here's the last thing.
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:50.780]   The third thing, and I think it's the most important and the most difficult to bring
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:58.300]   about, namely, that the political voice of Christians, especially pastors, I would say,
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:06.720]   the political voice of Christians should be so permeated by the announcement of the horrors
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:13.560]   of divine wrath over the human race because of God belittling sin and so permeated by
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:21.180]   the beauty of the gospel of divine rescue and so permeated with the unsearchable riches
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:26.620]   of Christ, the ruler of the nations, and so permeated with the demand for repentance and
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:33.900]   faith from every citizen and every politician that our voice should be so permeated with
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:42.180]   these things that it is evident to the world that political concerns for true Christians
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:50.120]   fade into mists compared to these vastly greater realities.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:56.020]   And I think one of the great failures of much of American Christianity, especially in recent
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:04.620]   days, I would say, is that we have fit into the world, including the political world and
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:10.020]   the entertainment world and the educational world and the business world, we've just fit
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:16.860]   in so comfortably, so innocuously, that it appears to the world that we're just at home
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:22.020]   here and that we put our hope in all the same things and all the same processes and all
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.980]   the same products and all the same politics that they do.
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:31.820]   So my point is that whatever we say about politics—and I'm not saying we shouldn't
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:38.300]   say anything—but whatever we say about politics, it should have this flavor.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:44.460]   We Christians have died with Christ and our life is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:51.540]   Our citizenship is in heaven, not on the earth, and we await our King Jesus who will come
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.940]   and banish all unbelief and ungodliness from the planet.
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:02.820]   Every political candidate without faith in Jesus will perish in everlasting torment,
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.780]   Republican or Democrat.
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:11.740]   God hates pride, including political pride, and all self-exalting swagger will be cut
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:18.060]   down by King Jesus, and God alone will be exalted in due time.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:22.820]   America is not the new Jerusalem, and politics is not salvation.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:29.620]   We may succeed in putting every fiscal policy, every wise social policy, every international
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:34.700]   policy in place, and America will still be a wicked people.
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:43.900]   All co-belligerence that muffle the call of co-belligerence to repent is unchristian and
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.460]   unloving.
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:52.020]   Calls for justice without calls for justice toward God and what we should do toward Him
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:57.360]   that's right and owing to Him is a compromise with injustice.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:03.700]   Under this radical orientation on Christ and His kingdom, we vote.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:10.360]   We vote, and we expect very little of eternal consequence from our vote.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:17.180]   One day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years is as one day, the apostle says, in
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:25.460]   the presence of God, which means that roughly two days have passed since Jesus went to heaven,
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:30.520]   and America, while she lasts, is about eight hours old.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:38.040]   Our politics should be permeated by what is real, not what is so utterly ephemeral.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.040]   Amen.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.560]   That's a really good word on the urgency of eternal things and the discord we feel in
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:49.720]   this world with its priorities and the eternal world which roots our own priorities.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.400]   Yes, on Saturday, the podcast turned seven years old.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.160]   Thank you for all your support over the years.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.400]   On Monday, we return to field a question about the cross.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.580]   Wasn't the cross overkill for sin?
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.580]   Interesting question.
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.300]   I know a lot of listeners actually wrestle with in some form.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.880]   We're going to voice it, and we're going to answer it on Monday.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.560]   Until then, if you're willing to help us out, fill out our online survey.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.920]   Many of you have already done so, so thank you.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.600]   If you haven't, please go to DesiringGod.org/survey.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.680]   That's DesiringGod.org/survey.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.680]   I'm Tony Reinhke.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.320]   We'll see you on Monday.
