[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   The following is a conversation with Michael Mina.
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.320]   He's a professor at Harvard doing research
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.120]   on infectious disease and immunology.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.680]   The most defining characteristic of his approach
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.080]   to science and biology is that of a first principles thinker
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.860]   and engineer focused not just on defining the problem,
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.120]   but finding the solution.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.120]   In that spirit, we talk about cheap,
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.280]   rapid at home testing, which is a solution to COVID-19
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.760]   that to me has become one of the most obvious,
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.560]   powerful and doable solutions.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.800]   That frankly should have been done months ago
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.720]   and still should be done now.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.720]   As we talk about its accuracy,
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.400]   it's high for detecting actual contagiousness
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.040]   and hundreds of millions can be manufactured quickly
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.720]   and relatively cheaply.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.620]   In general, I love engineering solutions like these,
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.320]   even if government bureaucracies often don't.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.960]   It respects science and data, it respects our freedom,
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.200]   it respects our intelligence and basic common sense.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.560]   Quick mention of each sponsor,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.920]   followed by some thoughts related to the episode.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.640]   Thank you to Brave, a fast browser that feels like Chrome,
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.260]   but has more privacy preserving features.
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.560]   Athletic Greens, the all-in-one drink
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.840]   that I start every day with
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.040]   to cover all my nutritional bases.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.420]   ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.440]   to protect my privacy on the internet.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.440]   And Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.840]   Please check out these sponsors in the description
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.040]   to get a discount and to support this podcast.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.680]   As a side note, let me say that
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.720]   I've always been solution-oriented, not problem-oriented.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.240]   It saddens me to see that public discourse
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.880]   disproportionately focuses on the mistakes of those
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.680]   who dare to build solutions
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.440]   rather than applaud their attempt to do so.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.320]   Teddy Roosevelt said it well
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.280]   in his "The Man in the Arena" speech over 100 years ago.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.600]   I should say that both the critic
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.840]   and the creator are important.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.180]   But in my humble estimation,
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.800]   there are too many now of the former
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.640]   and not enough of the latter.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.920]   So while we spread the derisive words
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.260]   of the critic on social media, making it viral,
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.080]   let's not forget that this world is built
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.040]   on the blood, sweat, and tears of those who dare to create.

[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.540]   And now, here's my conversation with Michael Mina.
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.480]   What is the most beautiful, mysterious, or surprising idea
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.640]   in the biology of humans or viruses
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.720]   that you've ever come across in your work?
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.720]   Sorry for the overly philosophical question.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.280]   (Lex laughing)
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.720]   - Wow, well, that's a great question.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.320]   You know, I love the pathogenesis of viruses,
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.320]   and one of the things that I've worked on a lot
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.880]   is trying to understand how viruses interact
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.760]   with each other.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.040]   And so pre all this COVID stuff,
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.000]   I was really, really dedicated to understanding
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   how viruses impact other pathogens.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.200]   So how if somebody gets an infection
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.560]   with one thing or a vaccine,
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.440]   does it either benefit or harm you from other things
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.920]   that appear to be unrelated to most people?
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.920]   And so one system which is highly detrimental to humans,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.240]   but what I think is just immensely fascinating is measles.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.880]   And measles gets into a kid's body.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.120]   The immune system picks it up
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.620]   and essentially grabs the virus
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.760]   and does exactly what it's supposed to do,
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.240]   which is to take this virus
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.000]   and bring it into the immune system
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.320]   so that the immune system can learn from it,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.760]   can develop an immune response to it.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.720]   But instead, measles plays a trick.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.000]   It gets into the immune system,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.120]   serves almost as a Trojan horse,
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.520]   and instead of getting eaten by these cells,
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.040]   it just takes them over,
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.200]   and it ends up proliferating in the very cells
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.460]   that were supposed to kill it.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.940]   And it just distributes throughout the entire body,
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.100]   gets into the bone marrow,
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.580]   kills off children's immune memories.
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.560]   And so it essentially,
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.660]   what I've found and what my research has found
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.980]   is that this one virus was responsible
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.360]   for as much as half of all of the infectious disease deaths
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.380]   in kids before we started vaccinating against it,
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.160]   'cause it was just wiping out children's immune memories
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.520]   to all different pathogens,
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.060]   which is, you know, I think just astounding.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.960]   It's just amazing to watch it spread throughout bodies.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.360]   We've done the studies in monkeys,
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.880]   and you can watch it just destroy
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.800]   and obliterate people's immune memories
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.100]   in the same way that some parasite
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.800]   might destroy somebody's brain.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.440]   - Is that a evolutionary just coincidence,
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.960]   or is there some kind of advantage
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.540]   to this kind of interactivity between pathogens?
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.720]   - Oh, I think in that sense, it's just coincidence.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.120]   It probably is a,
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.480]   it's a good way for measles to,
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.540]   it's a good way for measles to essentially
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.180]   be able to survive long enough to replicate in the body.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.180]   It just replicates in the cells
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.480]   that are meant to destroy it.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.480]   So it's utilizing our immune cells for its own replication,
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.520]   but in so doing, it's destroying the memories
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.180]   of all the other immunological memories.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.780]   But there are other viruses,
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.200]   so a different system is influenza.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.200]   And flu predisposes to severe bacterial infections.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.520]   And that, I think, is another coincidence,
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.320]   but I also think that there are,
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.340]   that there are some evolutionary benefits
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.340]   that bacteria may hijack
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.400]   and sort of piggyback on viral infections.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.200]   Viruses can, they just grow so much quicker than bacteria.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.700]   They replicate faster, and so there's this system
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.200]   with viruses, with flu and bacteria,
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.640]   where the influenza has these proteins
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.780]   that cleave certain receptors.
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.140]   And the bacteria wanna cleave those same receptors,
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.640]   or wanna cleave the same molecules
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.800]   that gave entrance to those receptors.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.960]   So instead, the bacteria found out,
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.040]   like, hey, we could just piggyback on these viruses.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.700]   They'll do it 100 or 1,000 times faster than we can.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.860]   And so then they just piggyback on,
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.040]   and they let flu cleave all these sialic acids.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.880]   And then the bacteria just glom on in the wake of it.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.100]   So there's all different interactions between pathogens
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.280]   that are just remarkable.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.220]   - So does this whole system of viruses
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.420]   that interact with each other,
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.100]   and so damn good at getting inside our bodies,
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.880]   does that fascinate you or terrify you?
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.320]   - I'm very much a scientist,
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.520]   and so it fascinates me much more than it terrifies me.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.540]   But knowing enough, I know just how well,
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.380]   you know, we get the wrong virus in our population,
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.460]   whether it's through some random mutation,
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.680]   or whether it's this same COVID-19 virus.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.600]   And it, you know, these things are tricky.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.400]   They're able to mutate quickly.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.360]   They're able to find new hosts and rearrange
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.920]   in the case of influenza.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.240]   So what terrifies me is just how easily
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.760]   this particular pandemic could have been so much worse.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.880]   This could have been a virus
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.000]   that is much worse than it is.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.360]   You know, same thing with H1N1 back in 2009.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.320]   That terrifies me.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.620]   If a virus like that was much more detrimental,
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.720]   you know, that would be, it could be much more devastating.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.100]   Although it's hard to say, you know,
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.280]   the human species were, well,
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.120]   I hesitate to say that we're good at responding to things
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.680]   because there are some aspects that were,
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.760]   this particular virus, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.680]   has found a sweet spot where it's not quite serious enough
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.880]   on an individual level that humans just don't,
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.880]   we haven't seen much of a useful response by many humans.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.040]   A lot of people even think it's a hoax.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.160]   And so it's led us down this path of,
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.680]   it's not quite serious enough to get everyone
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.960]   to respond immediately and with the most urgency,
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.560]   but it's enough, it's bad enough that, you know,
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.120]   it's caused our economies to shut down and collapse.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.120]   And so I think, I know enough about virus biology
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.120]   to be terrified for humans that, you know,
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.200]   it can, it just takes one virus,
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.080]   just takes the wrong one to just obliterate us
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.640]   or not obliterate us,
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.800]   but really do much more damage than we've seen.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.520]   - It's fascinating to think that COVID-19
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.520]   is a result of a virus evolving together with like Twitter,
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.560]   like figuring out how we can sneak past the defenses
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.800]   of the humans, so it's not bad enough.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.400]   And then the misinformation, all that kind of stuff
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.640]   together is operating in such a way
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.240]   that the virus can spread effectively.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.360]   I wonder, I mean, obviously a virus is not intelligent,
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.360]   but there's a rhyme and a rhythm
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.240]   to the way this whole evolutionary process works
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.080]   and creates these fascinating things
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.000]   that spread throughout the entire civilization.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   - Absolutely, it's, yeah, I'm completely fascinated
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.640]   by this idea of social media in particular,
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.600]   how it replicates, how it grows, you know,
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.080]   I've been, how it actually starts interacting
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.840]   with the biology of the virus, masks,
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.000]   who's gonna get vaccinated, politics,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.280]   like these seem so external to virus biology,
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.200]   but it's become so intertwined
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.760]   and it's interesting, and I actually think
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.120]   we could find out that, you know,
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.120]   the virus actually becomes, obviously not intentionally,
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.280]   but, you know, we could find that choosing,
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.880]   people choosing not to wear masks,
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.960]   choosing not to counter this virus
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.280]   in a regimented and sort of organized way
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.080]   effectively gives the virus more opportunity to escape.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.760]   We can look at vaccines, you know,
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.200]   we're about to have one of the most aggressive
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.760]   vaccination programs the world has ever seen,
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.800]   but we are unfortunately doing it
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.120]   right at the peak of viral transmission
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.040]   when millions and millions of people
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.400]   are still getting infected, and when we do that,
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.560]   that just gives this virus so many more opportunities,
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.680]   I mean, orders of magnitude more opportunity
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.400]   to mutate around our immune system.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.280]   Now, if we were to vaccinate everyone
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.680]   when there's not a lot of virus,
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.120]   then there's just not a lot of virus,
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.760]   and so there's not going to be as many,
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.280]   you know, I don't even know how many zeros
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.440]   are at the end of however many viral particles
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.560]   there are in the world right now,
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.760]   you know, more than quadrillions, you know,
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.460]   and so if you assume that at any given time,
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.360]   somebody might have trillions of virus in them
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.760]   on any given individual, so then, you know,
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.360]   multiply trillions by millions,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.480]   and you know, you get a lot of viruses out there,
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.800]   and if you start applying pressure,
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.200]   ecological pressure to this virus,
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.000]   that when it's not abundant,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.920]   God, the opportunity for a virus to sneak around immunity,
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.360]   especially when all the vaccines are identical, essentially.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.480]   - It takes one to mutate, and it jumps, oh.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.560]   - Takes one, takes one in the whole world,
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.680]   you know, and we have to not forget
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.400]   that this particular virus was one.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.560]   It was one opportunity, and it has spread across the globe,
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.720]   and there's no reason that can't happen tomorrow,
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.060]   I knew, you know, it's scary.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.380]   - I have a million other questions in this direction,
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:56.100]   but I'd love to talk about one of the most exciting aspects
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.700]   of your work, which is testing, or rapid testing.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.900]   You wrote a great article in Time on November 17th,
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.820]   so this is like a month ago, about rapid testing,
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:13.420]   titled "How We Can Stop the Spread of COVID-19 by Christmas."
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.700]   Let's jot down the fact that this was a month ago,
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.940]   so maybe your timeline would be different,
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.460]   but let's say in a month.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.380]   So you've talked about this powerful idea
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.380]   for quite a while, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.100]   How do we stop the spread of COVID-19 in a month?
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.940]   - Well, we use tests like these.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.980]   You know, so the only reason the virus continues spreading
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.380]   is because people spread it to each other.
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.060]   This isn't magic.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.140]   - Yes.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.700]   - And so there's a few ways to stop the virus
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.980]   from spreading to each other,
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.980]   and that is you either can vaccinate everyone,
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.420]   and vaccinating everyone is a way
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.220]   to immunologically prevent the virus
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.760]   from growing inside of somebody and therefore spreading.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.220]   We don't know yet, actually, if this vaccine,
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.620]   if any of these vaccines are going
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.260]   to prevent onward transmission,
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:10.060]   so that may or may not serve to be one opportunity.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.680]   Certainly, I think it will decrease transmission,
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.240]   but the other idea that we have at our disposal now,
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.540]   we had it in May, we had it in June,
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.120]   July, August, September, October, November,
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.680]   and now it's December.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.300]   We still have it, we still choose not to use it
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.160]   in this country and in much of the world,
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.320]   and that's rapid testing.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.600]   That is giving, it's empowering people
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.560]   to know that they are infected
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.880]   and giving them the opportunity to not spread it
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.980]   to their loved ones and their friends
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.540]   and neighbors and whoever else.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.740]   We could have done this, we still can.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.360]   Today, we could start.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.520]   We have millions of these tests.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.800]   These tests are simple paper strip tests.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.660]   They are, inside of this thing
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.440]   is just a little piece of paper.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.360]   Now, and I can actually open it up here.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.520]   There we go.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.260]   So this, this is how we do it, right here.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.280]   We have this little paper strip test.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.160]   This is enough to let you know if you're infectious.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.680]   With somewhere around the order of 99% sensitivity,
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.080]   99% specificity, you can know
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.840]   if you have infectious virus in you.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.240]   If we can get these out to everyone's homes,
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.200]   build these, make 10 million, 20 million,
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.800]   30 million of them a day.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.500]   You know, we make more bottles of Dasani water every day.
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.520]   We can make these little paper strip tests.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.680]   And if we do that, and we get these into people's homes
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.040]   so that they can use them twice a week,
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.960]   then we can know if we're infectious.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.140]   You know, is it perfect?
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.060]   Absolutely not.
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.120]   But is it near perfect?
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.360]   Absolutely.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.520]   You know, and so if we can say,
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.360]   hey, the transmission of this is, you know,
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.720]   for every 100 people that get infected right now,
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.000]   they go on to infect maybe 130 additional people.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.160]   And that's exponential growth.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.360]   So 100 becomes 130.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.360]   A couple days later, that 130 becomes another 165 people
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.640]   have now been infected.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.400]   And you know, go over three weeks,
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.920]   and 100 people become 500 people infected.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.080]   Now, it doesn't take much to have those 100 people
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.760]   not infect 130, but infect 90.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.520]   All we have to do is remove, say, 30, 40% of new infections
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.280]   from continuing their spread.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.040]   And then instead of exponential growth,
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.040]   you have exponential decay.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.000]   So this doesn't need to be perfect.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.120]   We don't have to go from 100 to zero.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.280]   We just have to go and have those 100 people infect 90.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.600]   And those 90 people infect, you know, 82,
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.800]   whatever it might be.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.720]   And you do that for a few weeks, and boom,
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.760]   you have now gone, instead of 100 to 500,
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.720]   you've gone from 100 to 20.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.720]   - Yes. - It's not very hard.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.200]   And so the way to do that is to let people know
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.280]   that they're infectious.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.200]   I mean, we're a perfect example right now.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.840]   I, this morning, I used these tests
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.640]   to make sure that I wasn't infectious.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.480]   Is it perfect?
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.880]   No, but it reduced my odds 99%.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.600]   I already was at extremely low odds
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.480]   because I spend my life quarantining these days.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.720]   - Well, the interesting thing with this test,
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.000]   with testing in general,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.360]   which is why I love what you've been espousing,
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.600]   and it's really confusing to me
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.880]   that this has not been taken on,
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.640]   is it's one, an actual solution
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.720]   that's been available for a long time.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   There doesn't seem to have been solutions proposed
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.360]   at a large scale.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.640]   And a solution that it seems like a lot of people
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.840]   would be able to get behind.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.840]   There's some politicization or fear of other solutions
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.120]   that people have proposed, which is like lockdown.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.280]   And there's a worry,
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.760]   especially in the American spirit of freedom,
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.640]   like you can't tell me what to do.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.000]   The thing about tests is it empowers you
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.080]   with information, essentially.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.840]   So like, it gives you more information
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.000]   about your role in this pandemic,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.680]   and then you can do whatever the hell you want.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.000]   It's all up to your ethics and so on.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.800]   So it's obvious that with that information,
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.520]   people would be able to protect their loved ones
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.240]   and also do their sort of, quote unquote,
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.000]   duty for their country, right?
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.800]   Is protect the rest of the country.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.840]   - That's exactly right.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.320]   I mean, it's just, it's empowerment.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.240]   But this is a problem.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.280]   We have not put these into action in large part
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.880]   because we have a medical industry
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.200]   that doesn't wanna see them be used.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.160]   We have a political and a regulatory industry
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.640]   that doesn't wanna see them be used.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.520]   That sounds crazy.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.840]   Why wouldn't they want them to be used?
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.200]   We have a very paternalistic approach
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.640]   to everything in this country.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.500]   Now, despite this country kind of being founded
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.360]   on this individualistic ideal,
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.760]   pull yourself up from your bootstraps, all that stuff.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.240]   When it comes to public health,
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.240]   we have a bunch of ivory tower academics who want data.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.360]   They want to see perfection.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.900]   And we have this issue of letting perfection
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.280]   get in the way of actually doing something at all,
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.520]   doing something effective.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.080]   And so we keep comparing these tests, for example,
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.000]   to the laboratory-based PCR test.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.800]   And sure, this isn't a PCR test,
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.480]   but this doesn't cost $100
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.780]   and it doesn't take five days to get back,
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.800]   which means in every single scenario,
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.900]   this is the more effective test.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.720]   And we have, unfortunately, a system
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.980]   that's not about public health.
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:47.980]   We have entirely eroded any ideals of public health
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.560]   in our country for the biomedical complex,
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.300]   this medical industrial complex, which overrides everything.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.960]   And that's why I'm just,
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.800]   can I swear on this podcast?
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.680]   - Yes. (both laughing)
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.200]   - I'm just so fucking pissed that these tests don't exist.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.480]   Meanwhile, and everyone says,
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.220]   oh, we couldn't make these, that we could never do it.
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.400]   That would be such a hard, a difficult problem.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.280]   Meanwhile, the vaccine gets,
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.760]   we have, at the same time that we could have gotten
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.060]   these stupid little paper strip tests out to every household,
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.320]   we have developed a brand new vaccine.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.000]   We've gone through phase one, phase two, phase three trials.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   We've scaled up its production.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.880]   And now we have UPS and FedEx
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.840]   and all the logistics in the world,
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.880]   getting freezers out to where they need to be.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.080]   We have this immense, we see when it comes to medicine,
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.400]   something you're injecting into somebody,
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.560]   then all of a sudden people say, oh, yes, we can.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.680]   But you say, oh no, that's too simple a solution,
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.760]   too cheap a solution.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.180]   No way could we possibly do that.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.040]   It's this faulty thinking in our country,
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.000]   which frankly is driven by big money,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.800]   big, the only time when we actually think
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.520]   that we can do something that's maybe aggressive
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.680]   and complicated is when there's billions and billions
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.160]   and billions of dollars in it.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.200]   - I mean, on a difficult note,
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.240]   because this is part of your work from before the COVID,
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.880]   it does seem that I saw a statistic currently
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.400]   is that 40% would not be taken,
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.200]   of Americans would not be taking the vaccine,
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.800]   some number like this.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.480]   So you also have to acknowledge that
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.720]   all the money that's been invested,
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.920]   like there doesn't appear to be a solution
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.240]   to deal with the fear and distrust that people have.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.680]   I bet, I don't know if you know this number,
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.300]   but for taking a strip, like a rapid test like this,
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.100]   I bet you people would say,
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.040]   like the percentage of people that wouldn't take it
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.240]   is in the single digits probably.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.840]   - I completely think so.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.060]   And there's a lot of people
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.400]   who don't wanna get a test today.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.100]   And that's because it gets sent to a lab,
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.800]   it gets reported, it has all this stuff.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.880]   And we're a country which teaches people
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.080]   from the time they're babies,
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.480]   to keep their medical data close to them.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.920]   We have HIPAA, we have all these,
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.720]   we have immense rules and regulations
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.560]   to ensure the privacy of people's medical data.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.000]   And then a pandemic comes around
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.560]   and we just assume that all that the average person
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.600]   is gonna wipe all of that away and say,
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.560]   oh no, I'm happy giving out, not just my own medical data,
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.940]   but also to tell the authorities,
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.340]   everyone who I've spent my time with,
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.020]   so that they all get a call
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.300]   and are pissed at me for giving up their names.
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.100]   So people aren't getting tested
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.020]   and they're definitely not giving up their contacts
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.900]   when it comes to contact tracing.
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.780]   And so for so many reasons, that approach is failing.
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.100]   Not to even mention the delays in testing
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:41.940]   and things like that.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.560]   And so this is a whole different approach,
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.020]   but it's an approach that empowers people
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.580]   and takes the power a bit away from the people in charge.
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.340]   And that's what's really grating on,
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.100]   I think public health officials who say,
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.460]   no, we need the data.
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.580]   So they're effectively saying, if I can't have the data,
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.220]   I don't want the individuals,
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.760]   I don't want the public to have their own data either.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.680]   Which is a terrible approach to a pandemic
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.860]   where we can't solve a public health crisis
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.860]   without actively engaging the public.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.900]   It just doesn't work.
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.460]   And that's what we're trying to do right now,
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.180]   which is a terrible approach.
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.700]   - So first of all, you have a really nice,
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.900]   informative website, rapidtest.org,
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:24.940]   with information on this.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.940]   I still can't believe this is not more popular.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:27.780]   It's ridiculous.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.780]   Okay, but one of the FAQs you have is,
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.160]   are rapid tests too expensive?
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.300]   So can cost be brought down?
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.800]   Like I take a weekly PCR test
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.140]   and I think I pay 160, 170 bucks a week.
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.380]   - No, I mean, it's criminal.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.340]   Absolutely, we can get costs.
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.220]   This thing right here, costs less than a dollar to make.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.060]   With everything combined, plus the swabs,
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.020]   maybe it costs a dollar 50.
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.580]   Could be sold for, frankly, it could be sold for $3
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.740]   and still make a profit if they wanna sell it for five.
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.920]   This one here, this is a slightly more complicated one,
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.980]   but you can see it's just got
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.740]   the exact same paper strip inside.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.740]   This is really, it doesn't look like much,
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.020]   but it's kind of the cream of the crop
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.320]   in terms of these rapid tests.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.860]   This is the one that the US government bought
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.220]   and it is doing an amazing job.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:27.580]   It has a 99.9% sensitivity and specificity.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.500]   So it's really good.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.820]   And so essentially the way it works is you just,
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.140]   you use a swab, you put the,
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.140]   once you kind of use the swab on yourself,
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.020]   you put the swab into these little holes here,
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.460]   you put some buffer on it and you close it,
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.900]   and a line will show up if it's positive
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.780]   and a line won't show up if it's negative.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.500]   It takes five, 10 minutes.
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.980]   This whole thing, this can be made so cheap
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.680]   that the US government was able to buy them,
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.680]   buy 150 million of them from Abbott for $5 a piece.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.240]   So anyone who says that these are expensive,
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.140]   we have the proof is right here.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.740]   This one at its, it was,
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.340]   Abbott did not lose money on this deal.
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:14.820]   They got $750 million for selling 150 million of these
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.940]   at five bucks a piece.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:20.460]   All of these tests can do the same.
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.500]   So anyone who says that these should be,
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.620]   unfortunately what's happening though is the FDA
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.380]   is only authorizing all of these tests as medical devices.
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.340]   So what happens when you, if I'm a medical company,
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.580]   if I'm a test production company
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.460]   and I wanna make this test,
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.580]   and I go through and the FDA,
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.060]   at the end of my authorization, the FDA says,
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.180]   okay, you now have a medical device,
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.880]   not a public health tool, but a medical device,
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.820]   and that affords you the ability
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.060]   to charge insurance companies for it.
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.980]   Why would I ever as a,
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:00.980]   in our capitalistic economy and sort of infrastructure,
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.540]   why would I ever not sell this for $30
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.260]   when insurance will pay for it, or $100?
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.340]   Might only cost me 50 cents to make,
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.020]   but by pushing all of these tests
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.660]   through a medical pathway at the FDA,
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.280]   what extrudes out the other side
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.940]   is an expensive medical device
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.380]   that's erroneously expensive.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.900]   It doesn't need to be inflated in cost,
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.100]   but the companies say, well, I'd rather make fewer of them
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.340]   and just sell them all for $30 a piece
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:34.020]   than make tens of millions of them, which I could do,
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:39.020]   and sell them at a dollar marginal profit.
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:43.740]   And so it's a problem with our whole medical industry
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.420]   that we see tests only as medical devices.
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.340]   And what I would like to see is for the government,
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.500]   in the same way that they bought
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.920]   150 million of these from Abbott,
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.820]   they should be buying all of these tests,
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.140]   they should be buying 20 million a day
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.700]   and getting them out to people's homes.
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.060]   This virus has cost trillions of dollars
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.020]   to the American people.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.740]   It's closed down restaurants and stores,
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.820]   and obviously the main streets across America
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.820]   have shuttered.
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.460]   It's killing people, it's killing our economy,
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.900]   it's killing lifestyles and lives.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.260]   - This is an obvious solution.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.340]   To me, this is exciting.
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.800]   This is a solution.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.700]   I wish in April or something like that
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.880]   to launch the largest scale
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.340]   manufacturing deployment of tests.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.220]   Doesn't matter what tests they are.
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.060]   It's obviously the capitalist system
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.020]   would create cheaper and cheaper tests
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.380]   that would be hopefully driving down to $1.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.980]   So what are we talking about?
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.100]   In America, there's, I don't know,
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.180]   300 plus million people.
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:53.260]   So that means you wanna be testing regularly, right?
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.500]   So how many do you think is possible to manufacture?
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.780]   What would be the ultimate goal to manufacture per month?
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.940]   - Yep, so if we wanna slow this virus
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.660]   and actually stop it from transmitting,
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.360]   achieve what I call herd effects,
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.940]   like vaccine herd immunity,
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.160]   herd effects are when you get that R value below one
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.700]   through preventing onward transmission.
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:15.940]   If we wanna do that with these tests,
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:19.040]   we need about 20 million to 40 million of them every day,
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.580]   which is not a lot.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.540]   - In the United States? - In the United States.
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.500]   So we could do it.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.320]   There's other ways.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.180]   You can have two people in a household
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.060]   swab each other, swab themselves rather,
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.500]   and then mix, put the swabs into the same tube
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.320]   and onto one test.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.380]   You can pool.
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:40.300]   So you can get a two or three X gain in efficiency
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.340]   through pooling in the household.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.260]   Could do that in schools or offices too,
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.540]   where everyone just uses swab.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.740]   You have those two people.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.220]   I mean, even if it's just standing in line
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.580]   at a public testing site or something,
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.780]   you could just say, okay,
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.980]   these two are the last people to test or swab themselves.
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.580]   They go into one thing.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:59.900]   And if it comes back positive,
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.100]   then you just do each person and it's rapid.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.700]   So you can just say to the people,
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.600]   one of you is positive, let's test you again.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.500]   So there's ways to get the efficiency gains much better.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.660]   But let's say, I think that the optimal number right now
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.740]   that matches sort of what we can produce more or less today
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.020]   if we want it is 20 million a day.
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.540]   Right now, one company that,
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.700]   I don't have their test here,
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.460]   but one company is already producing
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.780]   five million tests themselves and shipping them overseas.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.920]   It's an American company based in California called Inova,
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.960]   and they are giving five million tests to the UK every day.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.060]   Not to the, you know, and this is just because there's no,
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.180]   the federal government hasn't authorized these tests.
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.660]   - So without the support of the government.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.260]   So yeah, so essentially,
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.220]   if the government just put some support behind it,
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.980]   then yeah, you can get 20 million probably easy.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:54.860]   - Oh yeah, this, I mean,
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.500]   just here I have three different companies.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.660]   These, they all look similar.
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.500]   Well, this one's closed,
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.220]   but these are three different companies right here.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.020]   This is a fourth, Abbott.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.580]   Now this is a fifth.
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.060]   This is a sixth.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.620]   These two are a little bit different.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.020]   - Do you mind if in a little bit,
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.620]   would you take some of these or?
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:12.820]   - Yeah, let's do it.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.500]   We can absolutely do them.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.820]   - So you have a lot of tests in front of you.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.060]   Could you maybe explain some of them?
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.260]   - Absolutely.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.340]   So there's a few different classes of tests
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.340]   that I just have here.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.180]   And there's more tests.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.860]   There's many more different tests out in the world too.
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.420]   These are one class of test.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.660]   These are rapid antigen tests
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.740]   that are just the most bare bones paper strip tests.
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:41.740]   These are, this is the type that I wanna see produced
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.920]   in the tens of millions every day.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.420]   It's so simple.
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.460]   You know, you don't even need the plastic cartridge.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:52.180]   You can just make the paper strip
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.340]   and you could have a little tube like this
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.660]   that you just dunk the paper strip into.
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.140]   You don't actually need the plastic,
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.300]   which I'd actually prefer
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.460]   because if we start making tens of millions of these,
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.340]   this becomes a lot of waste.
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.460]   So I'd rather not see this kind of waste be out there.
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.700]   And there's a few companies,
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.580]   Quidel is making a test called the QuickView,
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.060]   which is just this.
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.540]   They've gotten rid of all the plastic.
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.420]   - And for people who are just listening to this,
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.500]   we're looking at some very small tests
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.300]   that fit in the palm of your hand.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.340]   And they're basically paper strips
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.380]   fit into different containers.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.660]   And that's hence the comment about the plastic containers.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.180]   - These are just injection molded, I think.
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:36.920]   And they can build them at high numbers,
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.980]   but then they have to like place them in there appropriately
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:39.820]   and all this stuff.
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.460]   So it is a bottleneck
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.340]   or somewhat of a bottleneck in manufacturing.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.940]   The actual bottleneck,
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.300]   which the government I think
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.900]   should use the Defense Productions Act to build up
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.780]   is there's a nitrocellulose membrane,
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:57.220]   a laminated membrane on this that allows the material,
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:02.220]   the buffer with the swab mixture to flow across it.
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.220]   So the way these work, they're called lateral flow tests.
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:10.080]   And you take a swab, you swab the front of your nose,
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.940]   you dunk that swab into some buffer,
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.580]   and then you put a couple of drops of that buffer
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.500]   onto the lateral flow.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.080]   And just like a paper,
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.860]   if you dip a piece of paper into a cup of water,
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:25.020]   the paper will pull the water up through capillary action.
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.380]   This actually works very similarly.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.740]   It flows through somewhat a capillary action
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.300]   through this nitrocellulose membrane.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.900]   And there's little antibodies on there.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.180]   These little proteins that are very specific,
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.420]   in this case for antigens or proteins of the virus.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.460]   So these are antibodies similar
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:44.500]   to the antibodies that our body makes
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.700]   from our immune system,
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:48.420]   but they're just printed on these lateral flow tests.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.620]   And they're printed just like a little line.
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.620]   So then you slice these all up into individual ones.
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.700]   And if there's any virus on that buffer,
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.100]   as it flows across, the antibodies grab that virus,
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.240]   and it creates a little reaction with some colloids in here
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.920]   that cause it to turn dark.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:08.900]   Just like a pregnancy test, one line means negative.
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.540]   It means a control strip worked.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.100]   And two lines mean positive.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:16.100]   Means, you know, if you get two lines,
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.140]   it just means you have virus there.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.620]   You're very, very likely to have virus there.
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:20.980]   And so they're super simple.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.940]   This is, it is the exact same technology as pregnancy tests.
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:27.980]   It's the technology, this particular one from Abbott,
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.060]   this has been used for other infectious diseases
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.500]   like malaria.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.340]   And actually a number of these companies
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.520]   have made malaria tests that do the exact same thing.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.280]   So they just co-opted the same form factor
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.380]   and just changed the antibodies
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.620]   so it picks up SARS-CoV-2 instead of other infections.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.780]   - Is it also the Abbott one, is it also a strip?
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.060]   - Yep, yeah, this Abbott one here is,
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.180]   there's the, in this case,
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.740]   instead of being put in a plastic sheath,
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.940]   it's just put in a cardboard thing and literally glued on.
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.540]   I mean, it looks like nothing.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.380]   You know, it's just, it looks like a,
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.900]   like, I mean, it's just the simplest thing
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:04.740]   you could imagine.
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.600]   - The exterior packaging looks very Apple-like, it's nice.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.440]   - It does, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.840]   Yeah, so it's nice and it comes in a,
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.600]   this is the, this is how they're packaged.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.600]   You know, so, and they don't have to,
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.960]   you know, these are coming in individual packages,
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.960]   again, because they're really considered
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.200]   individual medical devices,
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.840]   but you could package them in, you know,
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.040]   bigger packets and stuff.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.760]   You wanna be careful with humidity
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.280]   so they all have a little,
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.600]   one of those humidity-removing things
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.080]   and oxygen-removing things.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:39.980]   So that's, this is one class, these antigen tests.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.620]   - If we could just pause for a second, if it's okay,
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:47.620]   and could you just briefly say what is an antigen test
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:49.580]   and what other tests there are out there,
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:50.980]   like categories of tests?
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:51.820]   - Sure.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.740]   - Just really quick.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.220]   - So the testing landscape is a little bit complicated,
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.940]   but it's, but I'll break it down.
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.080]   There's really just three major classes of tests.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.820]   We'll start with the first two.
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:06.320]   The first two tests are just looking for the virus
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.100]   or looking for antibodies against the virus.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.580]   So we've heard about serology tests,
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.600]   or maybe some people have heard about it.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.900]   Those are a different kind of test.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.260]   They're looking to see, has somebody in the past,
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.500]   does somebody have an immune response against the virus,
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.280]   which would indicate that they were infected
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.780]   or exposed to it.
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.780]   So we're not talking about the antibody tests.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.860]   I'll just leave it at that.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.780]   Those, they actually can look very similar to this
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:35.420]   where they can be done in a laboratory.
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.620]   Those are usually done from blood
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.620]   and they're looking for an immune response to the virus.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.780]   So that's one.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.060]   Everything I'm talking about here
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.720]   is looking for the virus itself,
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.960]   not the immune response to the virus.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.140]   And so there's two ways to look for the virus.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:51.340]   You can either look for the genetic code of the virus,
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:55.520]   like the RNA, just like the DNA of somebody's human cells,
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.460]   or you can look for the proteins themselves,
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.800]   the antigens of the virus.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.420]   So I like to differentiate them.
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:07.420]   If you were a PCR test that looks for RNA in,
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.980]   let's say if we made it against humans,
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.100]   it would be looking for the DNA inside of our cells.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.700]   That would be actually looking for our genetic code.
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:21.020]   The equivalent to an antigen test is sort of a test
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.500]   that like actually is looking for our eyes or our nose
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.180]   or physical features of our body that would delineate,
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.300]   okay, this is Michael, for example.
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.640]   And so you're either looking for a sequence
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.980]   or you're looking for a structure.
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.640]   The PCR tests that a lot of people have gotten now
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.640]   and they're done in labs usually
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.640]   are looking for the sequence of the virus, which is RNA.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.960]   This test here by a company called Detect,
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.360]   this is one of Jonathan Rothberg's companies.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:54.200]   He's the guy who helped create modern day sequencing
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.080]   and all kinds of other things.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.860]   So this Detect device, that's the name of the company,
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:02.000]   this is actually a rapid RNA detection device.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.160]   So it's almost like a PCR-like test
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.120]   and we could even do it here.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.140]   It's really, it's a beautiful test in my opinion.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.980]   Works exceedingly well.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.420]   It's gonna be a little bit more expensive
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.200]   so I think it could confirm,
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.480]   could be used as a confirmatory test for these.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.280]   - Is there a greater accuracy to it?
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.800]   - Yes, I would say that there is a greater accuracy.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.980]   There's also a downfall though of PCR
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.480]   and tests that look for RNA,
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.960]   they can sometimes detect somebody
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.380]   who is no longer infectious.
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:33.920]   So you have the RNA test
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.800]   and then you have these antigen tests.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.920]   The antigen tests look for structures
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.600]   but they're generally only going to turn positive
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.620]   if people have actively replicating virus in them.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:48.940]   And so what happens after an infection dissipates,
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.980]   you have, you've just gone from having sort of a spike.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.240]   So if you get infected, maybe three days later,
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.900]   the virus gets into exponential growth
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.520]   and it can replicate to trillions of viruses inside the body.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.560]   Your immune system then kind of tackles it
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.600]   and beats it down to nothing.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.860]   But what ends up in the wake of that,
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.760]   you just had a battle.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.000]   You had this massive battle that just took place
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.800]   inside your upper respiratory tract.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.680]   And because of that,
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.640]   you've had trillions and trillions of viruses
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.720]   go to zero essentially.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.600]   But the RNA is still there.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.100]   It's just, it's these remnants.
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.900]   In the same way that if you go to a crime scene
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.900]   and blood was sort of spread all over the crime scene,
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.820]   you're gonna find a lot of DNA.
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:31.660]   There's tons of DNA.
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.420]   There's no people anymore,
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.300]   but there's a lot of DNA there.
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.420]   Same thing happens here.
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.740]   And so what's happening with PCR testing
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.260]   is when people go and use these exceedingly
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:44.140]   high sensitivity PCR tests,
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.880]   people will stay positive for weeks or months
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.780]   after their infection has subsided,
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.600]   which has caused a lot of problems in my opinion.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.240]   It's problems that the CDC and the FDA
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.840]   and doctors don't wanna deal with.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.180]   But I've tried to publish on it.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.720]   I've tried to suggest that this is an issue
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.040]   both to New York Times and others.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.600]   And now it's unfortunately kind of taken on a life of its own
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.120]   of conspiracy theorists thinking.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:07.960]   - Oh no.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:08.800]   (laughs)
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.080]   - They call it a case demic.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.240]   They say, oh, PCRs,
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.040]   it's detecting people who are false positive.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.360]   They're not false positives.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.780]   They're late positives, no longer transmissible.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.180]   - I think the way you,
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:25.140]   like what I saw on rapidtest.org,
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:26.260]   I really liked the distinction
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:27.860]   between diagnostic sensitivity
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.100]   and contagiousness sensitivity.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.160]   That's so,
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:37.420]   that website is so obvious that it's painful
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.260]   'cause it's like, yeah,
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.020]   that's what we should be talking about
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:44.180]   is how accurately is a test able to detect
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.300]   your contagiousness?
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.800]   And you have different plots that show
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.580]   that actually there's,
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:52.800]   that antigen test,
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.580]   the test we're looking at today like rapid tests,
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.480]   actually really good at detecting contagiousness.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.320]   - Absolutely.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.660]   It all mixes back with this whole idea
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.740]   that of the medical industrial complex.
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:07.580]   In this country and in most countries,
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:10.940]   we have almost entirely defunded
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:14.620]   and devalued public health, period.
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:15.700]   We just have.
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:20.060]   And what that means is that we don't even,
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.140]   we don't have a language for it.
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.360]   We don't have a lexicon for it.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.900]   We don't have a regulatory landscape for it.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.160]   And so the only window we have to look at a test today
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.820]   is as a medical diagnostic test.
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:36.420]   And that becomes very problematic
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:40.140]   when we're trying to tackle a public health threat
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.300]   and a public health emergency by definition.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.980]   This is a public health emergency that we're in.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.900]   And yet we keep evaluating tests
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:52.860]   as though the diagnostic benchmark is the gold standard.
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.740]   Where if I'm a physician, I am a physician,
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:59.340]   so I'll put on that physician hat for a moment.
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.820]   And if I have a patient who comes to me
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.660]   and wants to know if their symptoms
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:08.660]   are a result of them having COVID,
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.060]   then I want every shred of evidence that I can get
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.940]   to see does this person currently
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:17.420]   or did they recently have this infection inside of them?
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:21.380]   And so in that sense, the PCR test is the perfect test.
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:23.100]   It's really sensitive.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.280]   It will find the RNA if it's there at all
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.900]   so that I could say, you know,
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.000]   yeah, you have a low amount of RNA left.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.140]   You might've been,
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.560]   you said your symptoms started two weeks ago.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:36.260]   You probably were infectious two weeks ago
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:39.180]   and you have lingering symptoms from it.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.740]   But that's a medical diagnosis.
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.780]   It's kind of like a detective recreating a crime scene.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:48.620]   They wanna go back there and recreate the pieces
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:53.060]   so that they can assign blame or whatever it might be.
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.020]   But that's not public health.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.220]   In public health, we need to only look forward.
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.780]   We don't wanna go back and say, well,
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:59.740]   was this person, are there symptoms
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.980]   because they had an infection two weeks ago?
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:05.020]   In public health, we just wanna stop the virus
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.460]   from spreading to the next person.
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:09.100]   And so that's where we don't care
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.820]   if somebody was infected two weeks ago.
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.780]   We only care about finding the people
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.060]   who are infectious today.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.980]   And unfortunately, our regulatory landscape
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:24.060]   fails to apply that knowledge
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.300]   to evaluate these tests as public health tools.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:29.420]   They're only evaluating the tests as medical tools.
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.860]   And therefore, we get all kinds of complaints
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:37.500]   that say this test, which detects 99 plus,
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.620]   you know, 99.8% of current infectious people,
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.940]   by the FDA's rubric, they'll say, no, no,
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.660]   that's, it's only 50% sensitive.
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.660]   And that's because when you go out into the world
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.820]   and you just compare this against PCR positivity,
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:57.020]   most people who are PCR positive in the world right now
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:00.700]   at any given time are post-infectious.
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:01.860]   They're no longer infectious
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:05.140]   because you might only be infectious for five days,
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.900]   but then you'll remain PCR positive
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.380]   for three or four or five weeks.
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.540]   And so when you go and just evaluate these tests
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.180]   and you say, okay, this person's PCR positive,
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.340]   does the rapid antigen test detect that?
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.220]   More often than not, it's no.
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:22.460]   But that's because those people don't need isolation.
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.260]   You know, they're post-infectious.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.980]   And this is a, it's become much more of a problem
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:31.500]   than I think even the FDA themself is recognizing
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.740]   because they are unwilling at this point
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:37.340]   to look at this as a public health problem
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.060]   requiring public health tools.
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.300]   - We'll definitely talk about this a little bit more
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.580]   because the concern I have is that like
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.580]   a bigger pandemic comes along,
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.340]   what are the lessons we draw from this
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.300]   and how we move forward?
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.300]   Let's talk about that in a bit.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:55.300]   But so can we discuss further the lay of the land here
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.180]   of the different tests before us?
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.020]   - Absolutely.
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.140]   So I talked about PCR tests and those are done in the lab
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.420]   or they're done essentially with a rapid test like this
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.060]   that detect, and we can even try this in a moment.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.640]   It goes into a little heater.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.580]   So you might have one of these in a household
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.660]   or one of these in a nursing home or something like that
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.500]   or in an airport, or you could have one
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.580]   that has a hundred different outlets.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.560]   This is just to heat the tube up.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.820]   These are the rapid tests.
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.820]   They are super simple, no frills.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:30.820]   You just swab your nose and you put the swab into a buffer
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.380]   and you put the buffer on the test.
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.540]   So we can use these right now if you want.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.380]   We can try it out.
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.020]   - And all the tests we're talking about,
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:40.100]   they're usually swabbing the nose.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.420]   Like that's the--
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:43.420]   - That's still the main, yeah.
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.140]   There are some saliva tests coming about
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.380]   and these can all work potentially with saliva.
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.380]   They just have to be recalibrated.
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.920]   But these swabs are really not bad.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:57.380]   This isn't the deep swab that goes like way back
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:58.580]   into your nose or anything.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:02.100]   This is just a swab that you do yourself
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.020]   like right in the front of your nose.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:04.860]   So if you wanna do it--
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:05.780]   - Yeah, do you mind if I--
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.020]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.320]   Yeah, why don't we start with this one?
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.860]   'Cause this is Abbott's BinexNOW test
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.780]   and it's really, it's pretty simple.
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.940]   - This is the swab from the Abbott test.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:16.780]   - That's correct.
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.620]   That's the swab from the Abbott test.
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.700]   So what I'm gonna do to start
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.180]   is I'm going to take this buffer here,
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:28.140]   which is, this is just the buffer that goes onto this test.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:29.000]   So this is a brand new one.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.020]   I just opened this test out.
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:35.020]   I'm gonna just take six drops of this buffer
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:37.120]   and put it right onto this test here.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:43.740]   - Two, three, four, five, six.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.100]   - Okay, and now you're gonna take that swab, open it up.
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:51.140]   Yep, and now just wipe it around inside the,
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.580]   into the front of your nose.
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:55.100]   Do a few circles on each nostril.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.500]   (sniffing)
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.340]   That looks good.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:05.580]   - This always makes me wanna sneeze.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.300]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.740]   Okay, now I'm gonna have you do it yourself.
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:13.700]   - I'm getting emotional.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.140]   - Hold it parallel to the test.
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.460]   So put the test down on the table.
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.220]   Yep, and then go into that bottom hole.
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.380]   Yep, and push forward
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.060]   so that you can start to see it in the other hole.
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:23.900]   There you go.
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.700]   And then turn, if it's, once it hits up against the top,
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.780]   just turn it three times, one, two, three, and sort of,
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.220]   yep, and now you just close.
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.540]   So pull off that adhesive sticker there.
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:39.340]   And now you just close the whole thing.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:43.060]   - And.
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.220]   - And that's it.
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.060]   - That's it.
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:50.060]   - Now what we will see is we will see a line form.
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:55.420]   What's happening now is the buffer that you put in there
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:46:00.420]   is now moving up onto the paper strip test
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:04.980]   and it has the material from the swab in there.
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.500]   And so what we'll see is a line will form
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.380]   and that's gonna be the control line.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.020]   And then we'll also see the,
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:17.540]   ideally we'll see no line for the actual test line.
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.140]   And that's because you should be negative.
[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:24.140]   So one line will be positive and two lines will be negative.
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:24.980]   - It's very cool.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.260]   There's this purple thing creeping up
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:30.340]   onto the control line.
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.460]   - That's perfect.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.020]   That's what you wanna be seeing.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.700]   So you want to see that,
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:41.100]   so right now you essentially want to see
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:45.780]   that that blue line turns pink or purple-y color.
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:49.260]   There's a blue line that's already there, printed.
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.660]   It should turn sort of a purple-pink color.
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:57.660]   And ideally there will be no additional line for the sample.
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:04.900]   - And if there is, that's the 99 point whatever percent
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:09.140]   accuracy on, that means I have, I'm contagious.
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.180]   - That would mean that you're likely contagious
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.260]   or you likely have infectious virus in you.
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.380]   What we can do, because one of the things
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:20.980]   that my plan calls for is because sometimes
[00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:24.580]   these tests can get false positive results, it's rare.
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.620]   Maybe 1% or in the case of this BinaxNOW,
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:30.140]   this Abbott test, 0.1%.
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.940]   So one in a thousand, one in 500,
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.380]   something like that can be falsely positive.
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:38.020]   What I recommend is that when somebody is positive
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.020]   on one of these, you turn around
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.340]   and you immediately test on a different test.
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.380]   You could either do it on the same,
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:48.180]   but for as good measure, you want to use a separate test
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.340]   that is somewhat orthogonal,
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:54.140]   meaning that it shouldn't turn falsely positive
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:56.060]   for the same reason.
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:59.620]   This particular test here, this detect test,
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:03.540]   because it is looking for the RNA and not the antigen,
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:05.700]   this is an amazingly accurate test.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.380]   And it's sort of a perfect gold standard
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:12.740]   or confirmatory test for any of these antigen tests.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.780]   So one of the recommendations that I've had,
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:17.780]   especially if people start using antigen tests
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.740]   before you get onto a plane,
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:22.820]   or as what I call entrance screening,
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:26.340]   if somebody's positive, you don't immediately tell them,
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.700]   you're positive, go isolate for 10 days.
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.940]   You tell them, let's confirm on one of these,
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:36.620]   on a detect test, that is because it's completely orthogonal,
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:39.380]   it's looking for the RNA instead of the antigen.
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.540]   There's no reason, no biological reason,
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:46.300]   that both of these should be falsely positive.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:50.500]   So if one's falsely positive and the other one is negative,
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.740]   especially because this one's more sensitive,
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:56.900]   then I would trust this as a confirmatory test.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:00.380]   If this one's negative, then the antigen test
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.180]   would be considered falsely positive.
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:04.140]   - It does look like there's only a single line,
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.540]   so this is very exciting news.
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.580]   - That's right, yep. (laughs)
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.900]   It says wait 15 minutes to see both lines,
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:14.060]   but in general, if somebody's really gonna be positive,
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:17.140]   that line starts showing up within a minute or two.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.180]   So you wanna keep the whole,
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.340]   we'll keep watching it for the whole 15 minutes
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:23.580]   as it's sitting there, but I would say you're,
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:26.860]   knowing that you've had PCR tests recently and all that.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:28.780]   - The odds are pretty good. - The odds are very good.
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.780]   - The packaging, very iPhone-like.
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:33.660]   I'm digging the sexy packaging.
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.020]   I'm a sucker for good packaging, okay.
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:38.340]   So then there's this test here, which is,
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:41.540]   this is another, it's funny,
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:42.900]   let me open this up and show you.
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.340]   This is a really nice test.
[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:45.660]   It's another antigen test.
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.260]   Works the exact same way as this, essentially.
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:51.140]   But what you can see is it's got lights in it
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:52.260]   and a power button and stuff.
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:57.260]   This is called an Ellume test, which is fine,
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:00.060]   and it's a really nice test, to be honest,
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:04.020]   but it has to pair with an iPhone.
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:07.540]   And so it's good as a, I think that this is gonna become,
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:11.740]   there's a lot of use for this from a medical perspective,
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.020]   where you want good reporting.
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.900]   This can, because it pairs with an iPhone,
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:20.420]   it can immediately send the report to a department of health,
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:23.340]   whereas these paper strip tests, they're just paper.
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:26.580]   They don't report anything unless you wanna report it.
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:28.860]   Okay, so I'm gonna just pick it apart.
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:32.180]   And so you can see is there's fluorescent readers
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.700]   and little lasers and LEDs and stuff in there.
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.100]   You can actually see the lights going off.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.380]   And there's a paper strip test right inside there,
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:41.380]   but you can see that there's a whole circuit board
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:44.380]   and all this stuff, right?
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:48.100]   And so this is the kind of thing
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.420]   that the FDA is looking for,
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:54.780]   for home use and things like that,
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:56.380]   because it's kind of foolproof.
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.340]   You can't go wrong with it.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.540]   It pairs with an iPhone, so you need Bluetooth,
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:01.780]   so it's gonna be more limited.
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.180]   It's a great test, don't get me wrong.
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:05.220]   It's as good as any of these.
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:08.420]   But when you compare this thing with a battery
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.900]   and a circuit board and all this stuff,
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:14.080]   it's got its purpose, but it's not a public health tool.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.020]   I don't wanna see this made in the tens of millions a day
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:17.940]   and thrown away.
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.420]   - But FDA likes that kind of stuff.
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.020]   - FDA loves this stuff,
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.980]   'cause they can't get it out of their mind
[00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:26.020]   that this is a public health crisis.
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:29.380]   We need, I mean, just look at the difference here.
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:30.540]   - Something with flashing lights
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.060]   is essential. - Yeah.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.020]   It's got batteries, it's got a Bluetooth thing.
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:36.620]   It's a great test, but to be honest,
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:39.780]   it's not any better than this one.
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.440]   And so I want this one.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.340]   It's nice and all.
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:46.420]   The form factor is nice,
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:48.980]   and it's really nice that it goes to Bluetooth.
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.460]   - But it goes against the principle
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.620]   of just 20 million a day.
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:53.900]   - Exactly. - The easy solution.
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:54.860]   Everybody has it.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:57.580]   You can manufacture, and probably,
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:58.980]   you could have probably scaled this up
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:00.060]   in a couple of weeks.
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:00.900]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:04.220]   These companies, I mean, the rest of the world has these.
[00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:05.300]   They can be scaled up.
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:06.700]   They already exist.
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:08.100]   You know, SD biosensors,
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.460]   one company's making tens of millions a day,
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.860]   not coming to the United States,
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:13.420]   but going all over Europe,
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:16.980]   going all over Southeast Asia and East Asia.
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:17.900]   So they exist.
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:18.980]   The US is just, you know,
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.100]   we can't get out of our own way.
[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:22.380]   - I wonder why somebody,
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.620]   I don't know if you were paying attention,
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:26.900]   but somebody like an Elon Musk type character,
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:28.980]   so he was really into doing some, like,
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:30.580]   obvious engineering solution.
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:33.980]   Like, this at-home rapid test
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:37.220]   seems like a very Elon Musk thing to do.
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.140]   - I don't know if you saw,
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:41.820]   but I had a little Twitter conversation with Elon Musk.
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:43.420]   - Does he not like, what is he,
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.500]   do you know what his thoughts are on rapid testing?
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.180]   - Well, he was using a slightly different one,
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:49.180]   one of these, but that requires an instrument
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:50.860]   called the BD Veritor,
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:52.020]   and he got a false positive.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:53.020]   Or no, I shouldn't say,
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:54.580]   he didn't necessarily get a false positive.
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:55.920]   He got discrepant results.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.900]   He did this test four times.
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.740]   He got two positives, two negatives.
[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:02.340]   But then he got a PCR test,
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:05.080]   and it was a very low positive result.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.580]   So I think what happened
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.140]   is he just tested himself at the tail end of an,
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.140]   this was actually right before he was about to send those,
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:12.220]   it was the day of, essentially,
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.420]   that he was sending the astronauts
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.140]   up to the space station the other day.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:17.820]   So he was using these rapid tests
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.100]   'cause he wanted to make sure that he was good to go in,
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:23.140]   and he got discrepant results.
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:25.220]   Ultimately, they were correct.
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:26.900]   But, you know, two were negative, two were positive,
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:28.540]   but what really happened,
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:30.740]   once he got his, he shared his PCR results,
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:32.860]   and they were very low positive.
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:34.580]   So really what was happening is,
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:36.140]   my guess is he found himself
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:39.940]   right at the edge of his positivity, of his infectiousness.
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.500]   And so, you know, the test worked
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:42.540]   how it was supposed to work.
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:45.820]   It, probably had he used it two days earlier,
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:47.260]   it would have been screaming positive.
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:49.500]   You know, he wouldn't have gotten discrepant results.
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.180]   But he found himself right at the edge
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:52.800]   by the time he used the test.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.100]   So the PCR would always pick it up
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:57.340]   'cause it's still, 'cause it will still stay positive
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:59.100]   then for weeks potentially.
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:02.660]   But the rapid antigen test was starting to falter,
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:04.960]   not in a bad way, but just,
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.860]   he probably was really no longer particularly infectious.
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:09.080]   And so it was kinda,
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.940]   when it gets to be a very low viral load,
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:12.740]   it becomes stochastic.
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:14.380]   - It's fascinating, this duality.
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:18.440]   So one, you can think from an individual perspective,
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.780]   it's unclear when you take four and half
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:23.860]   are positive, half are negative,
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.660]   like what are you supposed to do?
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:28.120]   But from a societal perspective,
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.900]   it seems like if just one of them is positive,
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:34.580]   just stay home for a couple of days, for a while.
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.220]   So when you're a CEO of a company
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:38.020]   and launching astronauts to space,
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:43.020]   you may not want to rely absolutely on the antigen test
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:47.380]   as a thing by which you steer your decisions
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:50.420]   of like 10,000 plus people companies.
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:53.780]   But us individuals just living in the world,
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:56.140]   if it comes up positive,
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:59.340]   then you make decisions based on that.
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:00.860]   And then that scales really nicely
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:03.620]   to an entire society of hundreds of millions of people.
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:07.420]   And that's how you get that virus to stop spreading.
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:08.300]   - That's exactly right.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.420]   You don't have to catch every single one.
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:12.720]   And the nice thing is that these will,
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.740]   these will catch the people who are most infectious.
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:16.940]   So with Elon Musk,
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:20.420]   generally that test, we don't have the counterfactual.
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:23.260]   We don't have his results from three days earlier
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.180]   when he was probably most infectious.
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:30.020]   But my guess is the fact that it was catching two
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:33.220]   out of the four, even when he was down at a CT value,
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:36.740]   a really, really very, very low viral load on the PCR test,
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:38.640]   suggests that it was doing its job.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:42.220]   And you just wanna, and the nice thing is
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:44.580]   because these can be produced at such scale,
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:49.140]   getting one positive doesn't immediately have to mean
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:51.760]   10 days of isolation.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:55.660]   That's the CDC's more conservative stance to say,
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.620]   if you're positive on any test,
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:59.220]   stay home for 10 days and isolate.
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.780]   But here, people would just have more tests.
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:04.620]   So the recommendation should be test daily.
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:06.940]   If you turn positive, test daily
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:09.260]   until you've been negative for 24, 48 hours,
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:10.240]   and then go back to work.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:12.340]   And the nice thing there is,
[00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.020]   now right now people just aren't testing
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:15.740]   'cause they don't wanna take 10 days off.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:16.980]   They're not getting paid for it.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:18.580]   So they can't take 10 days off.
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:21.840]   - Do you know what Elon thinks about this idea
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.400]   of rapid testing for everybody?
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:26.680]   So I understood, I need to look at that whole Twitter thread.
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:29.780]   So I understand his perhaps criticism of,
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:34.720]   he had like a conspiratorial tone from my vague look at it
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:37.920]   of like, what's going on here with these tests?
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:41.560]   But what does he actually think about this very practical
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.040]   to me engineering solution
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.120]   of just deploying rapid tests to everybody?
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:48.560]   It seems like that's a way to open up the economy in April.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.400]   - Well, to be honest,
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.480]   I've been trying to get in touch with him again.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:54.920]   I think take somebody like Elon Musk
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:57.720]   with the engineering prowess within his ranks
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:02.720]   to easily, easily build these at the tens of millions a day.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:07.120]   He could build the machines from scratch.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:08.200]   A lot of the companies,
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:12.840]   they buy the machines from South Korea or Taiwan, I believe.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.080]   We don't have to, we can build these machines.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:17.000]   They're simple to build.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.160]   Put somebody like Elon Musk on it,
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.960]   take some of his best engineers and say,
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:26.840]   "Look, the US needs a solution in two weeks.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:29.080]   "Build these machines, figure it out."
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.100]   He'll do it, he could do it.
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:33.080]   This is a guy who is literally,
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.860]   he has started multiple entirely new industries.
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:40.820]   He has the capital to do it without the US government
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:41.880]   if he wanted to.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.480]   And you know what, it would,
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:47.480]   the return on investment for him would be huge.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:50.400]   But frankly, the return on investment in the country
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.600]   would be hundreds of billions of dollars
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:55.580]   because it means we could get society open.
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:57.440]   So I know that he,
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:01.600]   his first experience with these rapid tests was confusing,
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:04.320]   which is how I ended up having this Twitter
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:07.000]   kind of conversation with him very briefly.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.360]   But I think that if he understood sort of a little bit more,
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:13.320]   and I think he does, I really love to talk to him about it
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.960]   'cause I think he could totally change
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.360]   the course of this pandemic in the United States,
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:18.200]   single-handedly.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.000]   You know, he loves grand things.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.680]   - Yeah, I think out of all the solutions I've seen,
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:29.680]   this is the obvious engineering solution
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.440]   to at least a pandemic of this scale.
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.840]   - I love that you say the engineering solution.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.640]   So this is something I've been really trying to,
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:43.200]   I'm an engineer, my previous history was all engineering,
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.160]   and that's really how I think.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.360]   I then went into medicine and PhD world,
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:52.680]   but I think that the world,
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:54.440]   like one of the major catastrophes
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:57.480]   or one of the major problems is that we have physicians
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:01.320]   making the decisions about public health and a pandemic
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.320]   when really we need engineers.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.240]   This is an engineering problem.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.620]   And so what I've been trying to do,
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:10.540]   I actually really want to start a whole new field
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:12.880]   called public health engineering.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.640]   And so I've been, eventually I want to try to bring it
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:18.080]   to MIT and get MIT to want to start a new department
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:18.920]   or something.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:21.620]   - It's a doubly awesome idea.
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:23.880]   (laughing)
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:25.840]   I love this.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:26.700]   I love every aspect.
[00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:29.840]   I love everything you're talking about.
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:30.960]   A lot of people believe,
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.520]   because vaccines started being deployed currently,
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:38.200]   that we are no longer in need of a solution.
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:44.480]   We're no longer in need of slowing the spread of the virus.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.640]   To me, as I understand it,
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:49.760]   it seems like this is the most important time
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.560]   to have something like a rapid testing solution.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.680]   Can you kind of break that apart?
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.040]   What's the role of rapid testing in the next,
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.760]   what is it, three, four months maybe?
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.000]   - Even more.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.680]   The vaccine rollout isn't gonna be as peachy
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.680]   as everyone is hoping.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.440]   And I hate to be the Debbie Downer here,
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:13.600]   but there's a lot of unknowns with this vaccine.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.660]   You've already mentioned one,
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.120]   which is there's a lot of people
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.080]   who just don't want to get the vaccine.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.440]   I hope that that might change as things move forward
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.120]   and people see their neighbors getting it
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.640]   and their family getting it and it's safe and all.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.640]   We don't know how effective the vaccine is gonna be
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.680]   after two or three months.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.960]   We've only measured it in the first two or three months,
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.200]   which is a massive problem,
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.160]   which we can go into biologically,
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.960]   'cause there's reasons to,
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.080]   very good reasons to believe that the efficacy
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.580]   could fall way down after two or three months.
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:44.600]   We don't know if it's gonna stop transmission.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.000]   And if it doesn't stop transmission,
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.400]   then we're not, then there's, you know,
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.880]   herd immunity is much, much more difficult to get
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.600]   because that's all based on transmission blockade.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.640]   And frankly, we don't know how easily
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.920]   we're going to be able to roll it out.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.640]   Some of the vaccines need really significant cold chains,
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.640]   have very short half-lives outside of that cold chain.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:10.360]   We need to organize massive numbers of people
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.520]   to be able to distribute these.
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.840]   Most hospitals today are saying that they're not equipped
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:17.940]   to hire the right people to be even administering
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.240]   enough of these vaccines.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.880]   And then a lot of the hospitals are frustrated
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.320]   'cause they're getting much smaller allocations
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.920]   than they were expecting.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.940]   So I think right now, like you say,
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.840]   right now is the best time, you know,
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.520]   besides three or four or five or six months ago,
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:38.080]   right now is the best time to get these rapid tests out.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.680]   And we need to, I mean, the country has the capacity
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.520]   to build them.
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:45.380]   We have, we're shipping them overseas right now.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:48.520]   We just need to flip a switch, get the FDA to recognize
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.480]   that there's more important things than diagnostic medicine,
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:54.880]   which is the effectiveness of the public health program
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.320]   when we're dealing with a pandemic.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.540]   They need to authorize these as public health tools,
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:04.200]   or, you know, frankly, the president could.
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:08.540]   You know, there's a lot of other ways to get these tests
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:11.260]   to not have to go through the normal FDA authorization
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:14.460]   program, but maybe have the NIH and the CDC
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:15.940]   give a stamp of approval.
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:19.860]   And if we could, we could get these out tomorrow.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.620]   And that's where that article came from, you know,
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:24.960]   how we can stop the spread of this virus by Christmas.
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.620]   We could, you know, now it's getting late.
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.860]   And so we have to keep updating that timeframe,
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.740]   maybe putting Christmas in the title wasn't,
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:34.620]   I should have said how we can stop the spread
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.220]   of this virus in a month.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.840]   It would be a little bit more timeless,
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.700]   but we could do it.
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.300]   You know, we really could do it.
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:44.380]   And that's the most frustrating part here is that
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:46.460]   we're just choosing not to, as a country,
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:48.820]   we're choosing to bankrupt our society
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.960]   because some people at the FDA and other places
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.980]   just can't seem to get their head around the fact
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.460]   that this is a public health problem,
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:58.160]   not a bunch of medical problems.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.500]   - Is there a way to change that policy-wise?
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.260]   So this is a much bigger thing that you're speaking to,
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:08.260]   which I love in terms of the MIT engineering approach
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:11.500]   to public health.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.260]   Is there a way to push this?
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.780]   Is this a political thing, like where some Andrew Yang
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:20.420]   type characters need to like start screaming about it?
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:24.360]   Is it more of an Elon Musk thing
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.320]   where people just need to build it
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.760]   and then on Twitter start talking crap
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:31.320]   to politicians for not doing it?
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:34.840]   What are the ideas here?
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.160]   - I think it's a little of both.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.880]   I think it's political on the one hand,
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.120]   and I've certainly been talking to Congress a lot,
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.440]   talking to senators.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:43.400]   - Are they receptive?
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.240]   - Oh yeah.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.360]   I mean, that's the crazy thing.
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.880]   Everyone but the FDA is receptive.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.240]   I mean, it's astounding.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:53.380]   I mean, I advise, informally I advise the president
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.740]   and the president-elect's teams.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:59.840]   I talk to Congress, I talk to senators, governors,
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:05.020]   and then all the way down to mayors of towns and things.
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:08.900]   And I mean, months ago I held a round table discussion
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:12.120]   with Mayor Garcetti, who's the mayor of LA.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:15.320]   And I brought all the companies who make these things.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.140]   This was in like July or August or something.
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.800]   I brought all the companies to the table and said,
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.200]   "Okay, how can we get these out?"
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.560]   And unfortunately it went nowhere
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.200]   because the FDA won't authorize them as public health tools.
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.800]   The nice thing is that this is one of the,
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.080]   nice and frustrating things,
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.200]   this is one of the few bipartisan things that I know of.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.380]   And like you said, it's a real solution.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.280]   Lockdowns aren't a solution.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:45.280]   They're an emergency Band-Aid to a catastrophe
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.000]   that's currently happening.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.200]   They're not a solution.
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:51.080]   And they're definitely not a public health solution
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.280]   if we're taking a more holistic view of public health,
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.760]   which includes people's wellbeing,
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.480]   includes their psychological wellbeing,
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.640]   their financial wellbeing.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.880]   Just stopping a virus,
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.360]   if it means that all those other things
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:05.720]   get thrown under the bus, is not a public health solution.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.720]   It's a myopic or very tunnel-visioned approach
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.520]   to a virus that's spreading.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:19.520]   This is a simple solution with essentially no downfall.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.080]   There is nothing bad about this.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.560]   It's just giving people a result.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.640]   And it's bipartisan.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.560]   The most conservative and the most liberal people,
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.560]   everyone just wants to know their status.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.760]   Nobody wants to have to wait in line for four hours
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.480]   to find out their status on Monday,
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.880]   a week later on Saturday.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.000]   It just doesn't make any sense.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.720]   It's a useless test at that point.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.480]   And everyone recognizes that.
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:49.440]   - So why do you think, like the mayor of LA,
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.380]   why do you think politicians are going for these,
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:57.840]   from my perspective, like kind of half-assed lockdowns?
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.480]   So I have seen good evidence
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.760]   that a complete lockdown can work.
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:08.600]   But it's just like communism in theory can work.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:12.160]   Theoretically speaking, but it just doesn't,
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.760]   at least in this country, we don't,
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.240]   I think it's just impossible to have a complete lockdown.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:21.940]   And still, politicians are going for these kind of lockdowns
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:24.080]   that everybody hates,
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:27.340]   that's really hurting small businesses.
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:29.320]   Like why are they going for that?
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.840]   - And big businesses.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.760]   - Yeah, all businesses.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.720]   But like basically not just hurting,
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.880]   they're destroying small businesses, right?
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:42.760]   Which is going to have potentially, I mean--
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:43.600]   - Very long-lasting consequences.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:47.760]   - Yeah, I've been reading, as I don't shut up about,
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.760]   the rise and fall of the Third Reich.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:54.760]   And there's economic effects that take a decade to,
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.940]   there's going to be long-lasting effects
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:02.440]   that may be destructive to the very fabric of this nation.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.520]   So why are they doing it
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.280]   and why are they not using this solution?
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.680]   Is there an intuition?
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:11.680]   I mean, you've said the FDA has a stranglehold, I guess,
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.800]   on this whole public health problem.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.280]   Is that all it is?
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.080]   - That's, honestly, it's pretty much all it is.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.720]   The companies, so the, somebody like Mayor Garcetti
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:28.640]   or Governor Baker, Cuomo, Newsom, any of these,
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.860]   DeWine, I've talked to a lot of governors
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.360]   in this country at this point.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.720]   And of course the federal government,
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:40.360]   including the president's own teams,
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:44.860]   and the heads of the NIH, the heads of the CDC about this.
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:50.080]   The problem is the tests don't exist in this country
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.480]   at the level that we need them to right now
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.200]   to make that kind of policy, to make that kind of program.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.200]   They could, but they don't.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:03.000]   And so what that means is that when Mayor Garcetti says,
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.720]   "Okay, what are my actual options today?"
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.600]   Despite these sounding like a great idea,
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.640]   he looks around and he says, "Well, they're not authorized.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:15.320]   "They don't exist right now for at-home use."
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:18.120]   And from his perspective, he's not about to pick that fight
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.980]   with the FDA, and it turns out nobody is.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.600]   - Why are people afraid of,
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.160]   it seems like an easy, strong fight.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.000]   It's like-- - Well, it's not a,
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.240]   so they don't see it as a fight.
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.640]   They think that the FDA is the end-all, be-all.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.640]   Everyone thinks the FDA is the end-all, be-all.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.720]   And so they just defer, everyone is deferential,
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.780]   including the heads of all the other government agencies,
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:42.360]   because that is their role.
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.960]   But what everyone is failing to see
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:48.600]   is that the FDA doesn't even have a mandate or a remit
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.800]   to evaluate these tests as public health tools.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.840]   So they're just falling in this weird gray zone
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:57.860]   where the FDA is saying, "Look, we evaluate medical products.
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:59.440]   "That's the only thing that I meant."
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:02.720]   Like Tim Stenzel, head of in vitro diagnostics at the FDA,
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:06.480]   he's doing what his job is, which is to evaluate public,
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.240]   which is to evaluate medical tools.
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.720]   Unfortunately, this is where I think
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.760]   the CDC has really blundered.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.040]   They haven't made the right distinction to say,
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.360]   "Look, okay, the FDA is evaluating these
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.640]   "for doctors to use and all that,
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.720]   "but we're the CDC and we're the public health agency
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.880]   "of this country, and we recognize that these tools
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.000]   "require a different authorization pathway
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.600]   "and a different use, not prescriptions."
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.920]   - A difference between medical devices and public health.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.520]   I guess FDA is not designed for this public health,
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.680]   especially in emergency situations.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.800]   - And they actually explicitly say that.
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.560]   I mean, when I go and talk to Tim,
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:50.120]   he's a very reasonable guy, but when I talk to him,
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.660]   he says, "Look, we don't, we just do not
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:55.920]   "evaluate a public health tool.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.440]   "If you're telling me this is a public health tool,
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.640]   "great, go and use it."
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.800]   And so I say, "Okay, great, we'll go and use it."
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.360]   And then the comment is, "But does it give a result
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.800]   "back to somebody?"
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.980]   I say, "Well, yes, of course it gives a result
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:13.320]   "back to somebody, it's being done in their home."
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.220]   He says, "Oh, well then it's defined as a medical tool,
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:16.440]   "you can't use it."
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.160]   So it's stuck in this gray zone where we,
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.860]   unfortunately there's this weird definition
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:24.480]   that any tool, any test that gives a result back
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.880]   to an individual is defined by CMS,
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.000]   Centers for Medicaid Services, as a medical device,
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.920]   requiring medical authorization.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.920]   But then you go and ask, it gets crazier,
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:41.920]   'cause then you go and ask Seema Verma, the head of CMS,
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:47.360]   okay, can these be authorized as public health tools
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:50.120]   and not fall under your definition of a medical device?
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.220]   So then the FDA doesn't have to be the ones
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:54.720]   authorizing it as a public health tool.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.120]   And Seema Verma says, "Oh, well, we don't have
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:02.040]   "any jurisdiction over point of care
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.540]   "and sort of rapid devices like this,
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:07.440]   "we only have jurisdiction over lab devices."
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.360]   So it's like nobody has ownership over it,
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.680]   which means that they just keep,
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:15.280]   they stay in this purgatory of not being approved.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.480]   And so this is where I think, frankly, it needs a president.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:21.040]   It needs a presidential order to just unlock them,
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:25.920]   to say this is more important than having a prescription.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.240]   And in fact, I mean, really what's happening now,
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.280]   because there is this sense that tests
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.760]   are public health tools,
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.120]   even if they're not being defined as such,
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.100]   the FDA now is pretty much,
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.080]   not only are they not authorizing these
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.120]   as public health tools,
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.680]   what they're doing by authorizing
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.480]   what are effectively public health tools as medical devices,
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.600]   they're just diluting down the practice of medicine.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.160]   I mean, his answer right now, unfortunately, is,
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.420]   "Well, I don't know why you want these
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:58.840]   "to be sort of available to everyone without a prescription.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.760]   "We've already said that a doctor
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:01.920]   "can write a whole prescription
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.800]   "for a whole college campus."
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.400]   It's like, well, if you're going in that direction,
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.640]   then that's no longer medicine.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.560]   Having a doctor write a prescription for a college campus,
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.360]   for everyone on the campus to have repeat testing,
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.800]   now we're just in the territory of eroding medicine
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:21.400]   and eroding all of the legal rules and reasons
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.840]   that we have prescriptions in the first place.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.160]   So it's just everything about it is just destructive,
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.920]   instead of just making a simple solution,
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:32.980]   which is, these are okay as public health tools
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:35.520]   as long as they meet X and Y metrics,
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.160]   go and CDC can put their stamp of approval on them.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.160]   - Well, what do you think, sorry if I'm stuck on this,
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:46.160]   your mention of MIT and public health engineering, right?
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.120]   I mean, it has a sense of,
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.400]   I talked to competition biology folks.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.160]   It's always exciting to see computer scientists
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.160]   start entering the space of biology.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.120]   And there's actually a lot of exciting things
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.800]   that happen because of that,
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.080]   trying to understand the fundamentals of biology.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:07.440]   So from the engineering approach to public health,
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.680]   what kind of problems do you think can be tackled?
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.600]   What kind of disciplines are involved?
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.240]   Like, do you have ideas in this space?
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.080]   - Oh yeah.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:19.600]   I mean, I can speak to one of the major activities
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:20.440]   that I wanna do.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.180]   So what I normally do in my research lab
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:26.260]   is develop technologies that can take a drop
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:27.940]   of somebody's blood or some saliva
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:30.560]   and profile for hundreds of thousands
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.300]   of different antibodies against every single pathogen
[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:36.360]   that somebody could be possibly exposed to.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.200]   So this is all new technology that we've been developing
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:43.040]   more from a bioengineering perspective.
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:47.680]   But then I use a lot of the mathematics tools
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.360]   to A, interpret that.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.000]   But what I really wanna do, for example,
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.640]   to kind of kick off this new field
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:55.220]   of what I consider public health engineering
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:57.600]   is to create, maybe it's a little ambitious,
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.220]   but create a weather system for viruses.
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:06.060]   I want us to be able to open up our iPhones,
[01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:08.800]   plug in our zip code and get a better sense,
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.660]   get a probability of why my kid has a runny nose today.
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:13.000]   Is it COVID?
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.440]   Is it a rhinovirus, an adenovirus, or is it flu?
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.960]   And we can do that.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:21.060]   We can start building the rules of virus spread
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:24.240]   across the globe, both for pandemic preparedness,
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.280]   but also for just everyday use.
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:30.280]   In the same way that people used to think
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.160]   that predicting the weather was gonna be impossible.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.840]   Of course we know that's not impossible now.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:35.700]   Is it always perfect?
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:39.480]   No, but does it offer, does it completely change
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.240]   the way that we go about our days?
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.140]   Absolutely.
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:46.860]   I envision, for example, right now,
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:50.080]   we open up our iPhone, we plug in a zip code,
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.880]   and if it tells us it's gonna rain today,
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.400]   we bring an umbrella.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:56.120]   So in the future, it tells us,
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:59.640]   hey, there's a lot of SARS-CoV-2 in your community.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.520]   Instead of grabbing your umbrella, you grab your mask.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:05.280]   We don't have to have masks all the time,
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.360]   but if we know the rules of the game
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.320]   that these viruses play by,
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.800]   we can start preparing for those.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:15.120]   And every year, we go into every flu season
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.440]   blindfolded with our hands tied behind our back,
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:21.200]   just saying, I hope this isn't a bad flu season this year.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:26.280]   I mean, this is, we're in the 21st century.
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:31.120]   I mean, we have the tools at our disposal now
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.680]   to not have that attitude.
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.960]   This isn't like 1920s.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:39.060]   We can just say, hey, this is gonna be
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:40.440]   a bad flu season this year.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:44.720]   Let's act accordingly and with a targeted approach.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.000]   Now, we don't, for example,
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.240]   we don't just use our umbrellas all day long
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:53.560]   every single day in case it might rain.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.560]   We don't board up our homes every single day
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:56.640]   in case there's a hurricane.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.880]   We wait, and if we know that there's one coming,
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:03.360]   then we act for a small period of time accordingly,
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.720]   and then we go back, and we've prepared ourselves
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:09.160]   in like these little bursts to not have it ruin our days.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.120]   - I can't tell you how exciting that vision of the future is.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.520]   I think that's incredible,
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.920]   and it seems like it should be within our reach.
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:22.360]   Just these weather maps of viruses
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:26.000]   floating about the earth, and it seems obvious.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.720]   It's one of those things where right now
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.960]   it seems like maybe impossible,
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.800]   and then looking back 20 years from now,
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.320]   we'll wonder why the hell this hasn't been done
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:42.240]   way earlier, though one difference between weather,
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:45.320]   I don't know if you have interesting ideas in this space,
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.920]   the difference between weather and viruses
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:51.080]   is it includes the collection of the data
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:54.400]   includes the human body potentially,
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.440]   and that means that there is some,
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.100]   as with the contact tracing question,
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:03.440]   there's some concern about privacy.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.240]   There seems to be this dance that's really complicated.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:11.160]   You know, with Facebook getting a lot of flack
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.560]   for basically misusing people's data,
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:17.480]   or just whether it's perception or reality,
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.880]   there's certainly a lot of reality to it too,
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:24.280]   where they're not good stewards of our private data.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:28.880]   So there's this weird place where it's like obvious
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:33.880]   that if we collect a lot of data about human beings
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:40.120]   and maintain privacy and maintain all basic respect
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.960]   for that data, just honestly common sense respect
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.800]   for the data, that we can do a lot of amazing things
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:48.920]   for the world, like a weather map for viruses.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.720]   Is there a way forward to gain trust of people
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.720]   or to do this well?
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:56.780]   Do you have ideas here?
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:58.560]   How big is this problem?
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.760]   - I think it's a central problem.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.720]   There's a couple central problems that need to be solved.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:05.600]   One, how do you get all the samples?
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.080]   That's not actually too difficult.
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:10.120]   I have a pilot project going right now
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:13.320]   with getting samples from across all the United States.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:16.140]   Tens of thousands of samples every week
[01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:19.200]   are flowing into my lab and we process them.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.280]   - So it's taking like one of the,
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:26.320]   basically there's biology here and chemistry
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.920]   and converting that into numbers.
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.760]   - That's exactly right.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:30.080]   So what we're doing, for example,
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:33.000]   is a lot of people who go to the hospital every day,
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.280]   a lot of people who donate blood, people who donate plasma.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.520]   So one of the projects that I have,
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.280]   I'll get to the privacy question in a moment,
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:42.440]   but this, so what I wanna do is the name
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:46.800]   that I've given this is a global immunological observatory.
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.480]   You know, there's no reason not to have that.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:49.440]   - Good name.
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.960]   - I've said, you know, instead of saying,
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.560]   well, how do we possibly get enough people on board
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.000]   to send in samples all the time?
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.480]   Well, just go to the source.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.680]   You know, so there's a company in Massachusetts
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:02.240]   that makes 80% of all the instruments
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.960]   that are used globally to collect plasma
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:07.120]   from plasma donors.
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:10.400]   So I went to this company, Hemanetics,
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.980]   and said, you know, is there a way,
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:17.640]   you have 80% of the global market on plasma donations,
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:21.480]   can we start getting plasma samples
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.200]   from healthy people that use your machines?
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.680]   So that hooked me up with this company called OctoPharma,
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.720]   and OctoPharma has a huge reach
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.880]   and offices all over the country
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.800]   where they're just collecting people's plasma.
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.480]   They actually pay people for their plasma,
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.120]   and then that gets distributed to hospitals
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:39.380]   and all this stuff as anonymous plasma.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:41.720]   So I've just been collecting anonymous samples,
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:45.140]   and we're processing them, in this case,
[01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:48.360]   for COVID antibodies to watch from January
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.460]   up through December, we're able to watch
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:54.240]   how the virus entered into the United States
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:56.480]   and how it's transmitting every day,
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.800]   you know, across the US.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:02.480]   So we're getting those results organized now,
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:06.080]   and we're gonna start putting them publicly online soon
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:09.100]   to start making at least a very rough map of COVID.
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:12.840]   But that's the type of thinking that I have
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.720]   in terms of like, how do you actually capture
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:17.080]   huge numbers of specimens?
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:20.200]   You can't ask everyone to participate on sort of a,
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.040]   I mean, you maybe could if you have the right tools,
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.400]   and you can offer individuals something in return
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.840]   like 23andMe does.
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:29.040]   You know, that's a great way to get people
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:31.060]   to give specimens and they get results back.
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:34.520]   So with these technologies that I've been building,
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.140]   along with some collaborators at Harvard,
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:39.960]   we can come up with tools that people might actually want.
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.280]   So I can offer you your immunological history.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:47.120]   I can say, give me a drop of your blood on a filter paper,
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.880]   mail it in, and I will be able to tell you
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:52.060]   every infectious disease you've ever encountered,
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:54.460]   and maybe even when you encountered it, roughly.
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:58.780]   I could tell you, do you have COVID antibodies right now?
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:00.580]   Do you have Lyme disease antibodies right now?
[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:03.700]   Flu, triple E, and all these different viruses.
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:07.020]   Also peanut allergies, you know, milk allergies, anything.
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:11.260]   You know, if your immune system makes a response to it,
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:13.220]   we can detect that response.
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:17.640]   So all of a sudden we have this very valuable technology
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.960]   that on the one hand gives people maybe information
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.980]   they might want to know about themselves,
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:25.020]   but on the other hand becomes this amazingly rich
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:26.740]   source of big data, you know,
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:29.860]   to enter into this global immunological observatory
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:33.460]   sort of mathematical framework to start building these maps,
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.820]   these epidemiological tools.
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:36.740]   But you asked about privacy,
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:40.360]   and absolutely that's essential to keep in mind,
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:41.900]   first and foremost.
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:46.900]   So privacy can be, you can keep these samples 100% anonymous.
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:49.320]   They are just, when I get them, they show up with nothing.
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.340]   They're literally just tubes.
[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:52.880]   I know a date that they were collected
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.620]   and a zip code that they're collected from,
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:59.020]   or even just sort of a county level ID.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:02.300]   With an IRB and with ethical approval
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:03.740]   and with the people's consent,
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:05.100]   we can maybe collect more data,
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:07.320]   but that would require consent.
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.560]   But then there's this other approach
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:10.980]   which I'm really excited about,
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:14.460]   which is certainly going to gain some scrutiny, I think.
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:17.900]   But we'll have to figure out where it comes into play.
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:20.240]   But I've been recognizing that we can take
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.860]   somebody's immunological profile
[01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:25.700]   and we can make a biological fingerprint out of it.
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:27.300]   And it's actually stable enough
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:28.540]   so that I could take your blood.
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:30.460]   Let's say I don't know who you are,
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:34.300]   but you sent me a drop of blood a year ago,
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:36.540]   and then you sent me a drop of blood today.
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:38.300]   I don't know that those two blood spots
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:39.740]   are coming from the same person.
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:41.440]   They're just showing up in my lab.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:46.500]   But I can run our technology over,
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:49.820]   and it just gives me your immunological history.
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:52.340]   But your immunological history is so unique to you
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:55.380]   and the way that your body responds to these pathogens
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:58.260]   is so unique to you that I can use that
[01:22:58.260 --> 01:22:59.620]   to tether your two samples.
[01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:00.560]   I don't know who you are.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.820]   I know nothing about you.
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:06.600]   I only know when those samples came out of a person.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.120]   But I can say, oh, these two samples a year apart
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.940]   actually belong to the same person.
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:12.340]   - Yeah, so there's sufficient information
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:16.060]   that immunological history to match the samples.
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:18.540]   Or from a privacy perspective, that's really exciting.
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:20.220]   Does that generally hold for humans?
[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:23.780]   So you're saying there's enough uniqueness to match?
[01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:25.980]   - Yeah, because it's very stochastic, even twins.
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:28.220]   So this, I believe, we haven't published this yet.
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:29.380]   We will soon.
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:30.540]   - You have a twin, too, right?
[01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:31.380]   - I do have a twin.
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:32.540]   I have an identical twin brother,
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.620]   which makes me interested in this.
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:36.460]   He looks very much like me.
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:37.660]   - Oh, is that how that works?
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:38.940]   (both laughing)
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:42.580]   - And DNA can't really tell us apart.
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:45.580]   But this tool is one of the only tools in the world
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:48.040]   that can tell twins apart from each other.
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:51.340]   Could still be accurate enough to say this blood,
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:55.580]   you know, it's like 99.999% accurate
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:58.020]   to say that these two blood samples
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:00.420]   came from the same individual.
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:01.940]   And it's because it's a combination,
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:04.140]   both of your immunological history,
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:09.140]   but also how your unique body responds to a pathogen,
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:10.900]   which is random.
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:14.200]   The way that we make antibodies is, by and large,
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:17.540]   it's got an element of randomness to it.
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:19.480]   How the cells, when they make an antibody,
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:22.500]   they chop up the genetic code to say,
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.240]   okay, this is the antibody that I'm gonna form
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.200]   for this pathogen.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:29.760]   And you might form, if you get a coronavirus, for example,
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.960]   you might form hundreds of different antibodies,
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.940]   not just one antibody against the spike protein,
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:35.720]   but hundreds of different antibodies
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:38.300]   against all different parts of the virus.
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:42.200]   So that gives us really rich resolution of information
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.640]   that when I then do the same thing
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:45.360]   across hundreds of different pathogens,
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.320]   some of which you've seen, some of which you haven't,
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.600]   it gives you an exceedingly unique fingerprint
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:54.920]   that is sufficiently stable over years and years and years
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:57.760]   to essentially give you a barcode.
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.600]   And I don't have to know who you are,
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.400]   but I can know that these two specimens
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.520]   came from the same person somewhere out in the world.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.080]   - It's so fascinating that there's this trace,
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:11.200]   your life story in the space of viruses,
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:13.560]   in the space of pathogen,
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:18.560]   like these, you know, 'cause there's this entire universe
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:22.320]   of these organisms that are trying to destroy each other.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:25.960]   And then your little trajectory through that space
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.680]   leaves a trace.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:29.460]   And then you can look at that trace.
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:30.380]   That's fascinating.
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:33.160]   And that, I mean, there's, okay,
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.560]   that data period is just fascinating.
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:40.240]   And the vision of making that data universally connected
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.600]   to where you can make, like infer things.
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.440]   And just like with the weather is really fascinating.
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.480]   And there's probably artificial intelligence applications
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.120]   there to start making predictions, start finding patterns.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.920]   - Exactly, we're doing a lot of that already.
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:57.280]   And that's how, how do we have this going?
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:00.360]   You know, I've been trying to get this funded for years now.
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.540]   And I've spoken to governments.
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:05.480]   Now everyone says, "Cool idea, not gonna do it."
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.240]   You know, why do we need it?
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.080]   - Oh, really?
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.280]   The why do you need it?
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.280]   - The why do you need it?
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.880]   And of course now, you know,
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:14.380]   I mean, I wrote in 2015 about this,
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:18.160]   why we would, why this would be useful.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:21.240]   And of course now we're seeing why it would be useful.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:25.560]   Had we had this up and running in 2019,
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:28.520]   had we had it going, we were drawing blood from,
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.760]   you know, we're getting blood samples from hospitals
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.800]   and clinics and blood donors from New York City,
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.200]   let's just say.
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:39.000]   Now that could have, we didn't run the first PCR test
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.720]   for coronavirus until probably a month and a half
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:45.680]   or two months after the virus started transmitting
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:46.920]   in New York City.
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:48.000]   - So it's like with the rain,
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.280]   we didn't start wearing umbrella or taking out umbrellas.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.120]   - Exactly, for two months.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:54.000]   - It was getting wet.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.120]   - But different than the rain,
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.960]   we couldn't actually see that it was spreading, you know?
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.520]   And so Andrew Cuomo had no choice
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:02.160]   but to leave the city open.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.800]   You know, there were hints that maybe the virus
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.320]   was spreading in New York City,
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.880]   but you know, he didn't have any data to back it up.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:08.700]   No data.
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:11.320]   And so it was just week on week and week.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:17.120]   And he didn't have any information to really go by
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.000]   to allow him to have the firepower to say,
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.440]   "We're closing down the city.
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:21.320]   "This is an emergency.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.420]   "We have to stop spread before it starts."
[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:28.360]   And so they waited until the first PCR tests
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:29.200]   were coming about.
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.680]   And then the moment they started running a PCR test,
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:32.600]   they find out it's everywhere, you know?
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.040]   And so that was a disaster because of course,
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:38.480]   New York City, you know, was just hit so bad
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:41.700]   because nobody was, you know, we were blind to it.
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.020]   We didn't have to be blind to it.
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:45.680]   And the nice thing about this technology is
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:47.980]   we wouldn't have, with the exact same technology
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:51.600]   we had in 2017, we could have detected
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:56.360]   this novel coronavirus spreading in New York City in 2020.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:57.740]   Not because we changed,
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.800]   not because we are actually actively looking
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:01.600]   for this novel coronavirus,
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.140]   but because we would see,
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:05.580]   we would have seen patterns in people's immune responses
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:08.220]   using AI or just frankly using our,
[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:10.560]   just the raw data itself.
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:13.160]   We could have said, "Hey, it looks like there's
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.720]   "something that looks like known coronavirus
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:18.340]   "is spreading in New York, but there's gaps."
[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:19.840]   You know, there's, for some reason,
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.720]   people aren't developing an immune response
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.540]   to this coronavirus that seems to be spreading
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:25.660]   to these normal things that, you know,
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:28.340]   and it just looks, the profile looks different.
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:31.640]   And we could have seen that and immediately,
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.180]   especially since we had an idea
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:36.940]   that there was a novel coronavirus circulating
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:39.020]   in the world, we could have very quickly
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:42.200]   and easily seen, "Hey, clearly we're seeing a spike
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:44.280]   "of something that looks like a known coronavirus,
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:46.980]   "but people are responding weirdly to it."
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:49.660]   Our AI algorithms would have picked it up
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:52.780]   and just our basic, heck, you could have put it
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:55.060]   in an Excel spreadsheet, we would have seen it.
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:56.660]   So--
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:58.260]   - And basic visualization would have shown it.
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:28:59.860]   - Exactly, we would have seen spikes
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:02.040]   and they would have been kind of like off,
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.220]   you know, immune responses that the shape
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:06.340]   of them just looked a little bit different,
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:08.500]   but they would have been growing and we would have seen it
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.620]   and it could have saved tens of thousands
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:12.300]   of lives in New York City.
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:14.020]   - So to me, the fascinating question,
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:15.020]   everything we've talked about,
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:18.060]   so both the huge collection of data at scale,
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:22.560]   just super exciting, and then the kind of obvious
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:26.320]   at scale solution to the current virus
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:30.180]   and future ones is the rapid testing.
[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:34.420]   Can we talk about the future of viruses
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:39.420]   that might be threatening our very existence?
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:44.140]   So do you think like a future natural virus
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:49.140]   can have an order of magnitude greater effect
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:52.240]   on human civilization than anything we've ever seen?
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:56.200]   So something that either kills all humans
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:01.200]   or kills, I don't know, 60, 70% of humans.
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:06.520]   So something we can't even imagine.
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.360]   Is that something that you think is possible?
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.760]   Because it seems to have not have happened yet.
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:16.760]   So maybe like the entirety, whoever the programmer is
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:20.040]   of the simulation that sort of launched the evolution
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:24.700]   for the Big Bang seems to not wanna destroy us humans.
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.320]   Or maybe that's a natural side effect
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:30.280]   of the evolutionary process that humans are useful.
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.600]   But do you think it's possible that the evolutionary process
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:35.720]   will produce a virus that will kill all humans?
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:36.960]   - I think it could.
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:38.080]   I don't think it's likely.
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:40.240]   And the reason I don't think it's likely is,
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:43.620]   well, on the one hand, it hasn't happened yet,
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:50.080]   in part because mobility is a recent phenomena.
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:52.680]   People weren't particularly mobile.
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:56.860]   Until fairly recently.
[01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:59.380]   Now, of course, now that we have people flying back
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:01.440]   and forth across the globe all the time,
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:06.060]   the chances of global pandemics
[01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:08.900]   has escalated exponentially, of course.
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:10.780]   And so on the one hand,
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:12.700]   that's part of why it hasn't happened yet.
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:15.020]   We can look at things like Ebola.
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:20.020]   Now Ebola, we haven't generally had major Ebola epidemics
[01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:23.080]   in the past, not because Ebola wasn't transmitting
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:27.100]   and infecting humans, but because it was largely affecting
[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:30.860]   and infecting humans in disconnected communities.
[01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:35.820]   So you see in rural parts of Africa, for example,
[01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:36.740]   in Western Africa,
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:40.660]   you might end up having isolated Ebola outbreaks,
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:43.740]   but there weren't connections that were fast enough
[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:46.480]   that would allow people to then spread it into the cities.
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:51.000]   Of course, we saw back in 2014, 15,
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:57.540]   massive Ebola outbreak that wasn't
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:59.340]   because it was a new strain of Ebola,
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:02.460]   but it was because there's new inroads and connections
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:05.900]   between the communities and people got it to the city.
[01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:08.300]   And so we saw it start to spread.
[01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:12.100]   So that should be a little bit for foreshadowing
[01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:13.740]   of what's to come.
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:15.420]   And now we have this pandemic.
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:17.240]   We had 2009, we have this.
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:19.980]   There is a benefit,
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:23.780]   or there is sort of a natural check.
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:26.380]   And this is a kind of Latke-Voltaire,
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:28.700]   predator-prey dynamic kind of systems,
[01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:30.580]   ecological systems in mathematics
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:34.580]   that if you have something that's so deadly,
[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:39.580]   people will respond more, maybe with a greater panic,
[01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:43.660]   greater sense of panic, which alone could destroy humanity.
[01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:47.820]   But at the same time, we now know that we can lock down.
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:49.180]   We know that that's possible.
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:50.820]   And so if this was a worse virus
[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:53.860]   that was actually killing 60% of people as infecting,
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:55.980]   we would lock down very quickly.
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:59.580]   My biggest fear though, is let's say that was happening.
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:01.020]   You need serious lockdowns
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:03.060]   if you're gonna keep things going.
[01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:05.340]   So the only reason we were able to keep things going
[01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:08.540]   during our lockdowns is because it wasn't so bad
[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:10.180]   that we were still able to have people work
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:13.440]   in the grocery stores,
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:14.700]   still have people work in the shipping
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:16.700]   to get the food onto the shelves.
[01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:17.860]   So on the one hand,
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:20.220]   we could probably figure how to stop the virus.
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:24.380]   But can we stop the virus without starving?
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:26.540]   I'm not sure that that,
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:30.260]   if this was another acute respiratory virus
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:34.100]   that say had a slightly, say it transmitted the same way,
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:36.380]   but say it actually did worse damage to your heart,
[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:38.060]   but it was like a month later
[01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:41.700]   that people started having heart attacks in mass.
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:45.660]   It's like not just one-offs, but really severe.
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:49.100]   Well, that could be a serious problem for humanity.
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:53.740]   So in some ways, I think that there are lots of ways
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:56.860]   that we could end up dying at the hand of a virus.
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:57.900]   I mean, we're already seeing it.
[01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:00.100]   Just, I mean, my fear is still,
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:03.420]   I think coronaviruses have demonstrated a keen ability
[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:06.580]   to destroy or to create outbreaks
[01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:10.340]   that can potentially be deadly to large numbers of people.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:14.580]   Flu strains though are still by and large my concern.
[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:17.620]   - So you think the bad one might come from the flu,
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:18.780]   the influenza?
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:20.780]   - Yeah, their replication cycle,
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:22.460]   they're able to genetically recombine
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:24.380]   in a way that coronaviruses aren't.
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:25.940]   They have segmented genomes,
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:27.540]   which means that they can just swap out
[01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:31.180]   whole parts of their genomes, no problem, repackage them.
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:34.060]   And then boom, you have a whole antigenic shift,
[01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:35.580]   not a drift.
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:38.160]   What that means is that on any occasion,
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:40.820]   any day of the year, you can have, boom,
[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:44.500]   a whole new virus that didn't exist yesterday.
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:48.620]   And now with farming and industrial livestock
[01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:51.060]   and we're seeing animals and humans
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:53.460]   come into contact much more,
[01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:58.460]   just the opportunities for an influenza strain
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:01.820]   that is unique and deadly to humans increases
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:05.860]   all the while transmission and mobility has increased.
[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:08.880]   It's just a matter of time, in my opinion.
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.900]   - What about from immunology perspective
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:16.340]   of the idea of engineering a virus?
[01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:18.140]   So not just the virus leaking from a lab
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:22.300]   or something, but actually being able to understand
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:26.100]   the protein, like everything about what makes a virus
[01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:29.500]   enough to be able to figure out ways
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:34.500]   to maybe targeted or untargeted attack biology.
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:38.060]   - Subvert immunity.
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:38.900]   - Yeah.
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:39.740]   - Yeah.
[01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:43.060]   - Is that something, obviously that's somewhere
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:48.060]   on the list of concerns, but is that anywhere close,
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:51.140]   of the top 10 highlights along with nuclear weapons
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:53.180]   and so on that we should be worried about?
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:55.620]   Or is the natural pandemic really the one
[01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:58.120]   that's much greater concern?
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:02.180]   - I would say that the former, that man-made viruses
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:07.180]   and genetically engineered viruses should be
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:09.340]   right up there with the greatest concerns
[01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:10.640]   for humanity right now.
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:15.220]   We know that the tools, for better or worse,
[01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:18.780]   the tools for creating a virus are there.
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:20.560]   We can do it.
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:26.780]   I mean, heck, the human species is no longer vaccinated
[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:28.120]   against smallpox.
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:29.580]   I didn't get a smallpox vaccine.
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:32.480]   You didn't get a smallpox vaccine, at least I don't think.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:36.700]   So if somebody wanted to make smallpox
[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:41.060]   and distribute it to the world in some way,
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:44.500]   it could be exceedingly deadly.
[01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:47.140]   And detrimental to humans.
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:52.180]   And that's not even sort of using your imagination
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:53.140]   to create a new virus.
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:54.940]   That's one that we already have.
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:58.100]   Unlike the past when smallpox would circulate,
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:01.140]   you had large fractions of the community
[01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:02.620]   that was already immune to it.
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:05.380]   And so it wouldn't spread or it would spread
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:06.220]   a little bit slower.
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:07.960]   But now we have essentially in a few years,
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:11.500]   we'll have a whole global population that is susceptible.
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.740]   Let's look at measles.
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:15.920]   We have an entire, I mean, measles.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:20.200]   I have, you know, there are some researchers
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.540]   in the world right now, which for various reasons
[01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:25.500]   are working on creating a measles strain
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:27.420]   that evades immunity.
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:28.900]   It's not for bioterrorism.
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:30.420]   At least that's not the expectation.
[01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:34.280]   It's for using measles as an oncolytic virus to kill cancer.
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.460]   And the only way you can really do that
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:39.580]   is if your immune system doesn't, you know,
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:41.860]   if you take a measles virus and there's,
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:43.820]   we don't have to go into the details of why it would work,
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:44.900]   but it could work.
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:48.180]   Measles likes to target potentially cancer cells.
[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:51.780]   But to get your immune system not to kill off the virus,
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:53.340]   if you're trying to use the virus to target it,
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:57.540]   you maybe want to make it blind to the immune system.
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:38:00.220]   But now imagine we took some virus like measles,
[01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:04.220]   which has an R naught of 18, transmits extremely quickly.
[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:05.740]   And now we have essentially,
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:07.540]   let's say we had a whole human race
[01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:10.340]   that is susceptible to measles.
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:14.620]   And this is a virus that spreads orders of magnitude easier
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:16.060]   than this current virus.
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:20.900]   Imagine if you were to plug something toxic
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:25.020]   or detrimental into that virus and release it to the world.
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:29.340]   - So it's possible to be both accidental and intentional.
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:30.180]   - Absolutely.
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:31.460]   Yeah, and so Mark Lipsitch,
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:33.600]   who's a good colleague of mine at Harvard,
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:36.960]   we're both in the, he's the director of the Center
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:39.960]   for Communicable Disease Dynamics where I'm a faculty member.
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.960]   He's spoken very, very forcefully
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:47.160]   and he's very outspoken about the dangers
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.400]   of gain-of-function testing,
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:53.400]   where in the lab we are intentionally creating viruses
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:57.760]   that are exceedingly deadly under the auspices
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:59.200]   of trying to learn about them.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:02.800]   So that if the idea is that if we kind of accelerate
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:07.080]   evolution and make these really deadly viruses in the lab,
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:11.200]   we can be prepared for if that virus ever comes about
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:14.560]   naturally or through unnatural means.
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:17.440]   The concern though is, okay, that's one thing,
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:20.900]   but what if that virus got out on somebody's shoe?
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:21.740]   Just what if?
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:29.800]   If the effects of an accident are potentially catastrophic,
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:33.640]   is it worth taking the chances just to be prepared
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:35.900]   a little bit for something that may or may not ever
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:36.740]   actually develop?
[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:40.360]   And so it's a serious ethical quandary we're in,
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:44.320]   how to both be prepared but also not
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:48.860]   cause a catastrophic mistake.
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:53.660]   - As a small tangent, there's a recent really exciting
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:58.660]   breakthrough of Alpha Fold 2, solving protein folding
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:00.920]   or achieving state-of-the-art performance
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:02.640]   on protein folding.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:07.640]   And then I thought proteins have a lot to do with viruses.
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:14.100]   It seems like being able to use machine learning
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:19.540]   to design proteins that achieve certain kinds of functions
[01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:22.860]   will naturally allow you to use, maybe down the line,
[01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:26.380]   not yet, but allow you to use machine learning
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:31.220]   to design basically viruses, maybe like measles for good,
[01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:36.220]   which is like to attack cancer cells, but also for bad.
[01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:41.500]   Is that a crazy thought, or is this a natural place
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:46.480]   where this technology may go?
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.400]   I suppose all technologies can, which is for good
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:52.020]   and for bad.
[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:54.060]   Do you think about the role of machine learning in this?
[01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:55.640]   - Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:59.420]   I mean, Alpha Fold is amazing.
[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:03.540]   It's an amazing algorithm, series of algorithms.
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:08.220]   And it does demonstrate, to me it demonstrates
[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:12.540]   just how powerful, everything in the world has rules.
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:13.960]   We just don't know the rules.
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:17.160]   We often don't know them, but our brain has rules,
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.000]   how it works.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.220]   Everything is plus and minus.
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:21.200]   There's nothing in the world that's really not
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:25.260]   at its most basic level, positive, negative.
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:28.180]   It's all, obviously, it's all just charge.
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:31.580]   And that means everything, you can figure it out
[01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:33.820]   with enough computational power and enough.
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:36.260]   In this case, I mean, machine learning and AI
[01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:40.060]   is just one way to learn rules.
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:42.600]   It's an empirical way to learn rules,
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:44.940]   but it's a profoundly powerful way.
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:51.380]   And certainly, now that we are getting to a point
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:55.040]   where we can take a protein and know how it folds,
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:42:00.100]   given its sequence, we can reverse engineer that
[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:04.020]   and we can say, okay, we want a protein to fold this way.
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:06.000]   What does the sequence need to be?
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.740]   We haven't done that yet so much,
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:11.940]   but it's just the next iteration of all of this.
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:15.020]   So let's say somebody wants to develop a virus.
[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:17.620]   It's gonna start with somebody wanting to develop a virus
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:20.900]   to defeat cancer, something good.
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:23.060]   And so it would start with a lot of money
[01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:24.460]   from the federal government.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.420]   For all the positives that will come out of it.
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:32.220]   But we have to be really careful
[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:34.540]   because that will come about.
[01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:37.420]   There's no doubt in my mind that we will develop,
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:38.260]   we're already doing it.
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:41.700]   We engineer molecules all the time for specific uses.
[01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:44.540]   Oftentimes, we take them from nature and then tweak them.
[01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:47.300]   But now we can supercharge it.
[01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:50.840]   We can accelerate the pace of discovery
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:52.460]   to not have it just be discovery.
[01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:55.780]   We have it be true ground-up engineering.
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:43:00.060]   - Let's say you're trying to make a new molecule
[01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:03.580]   to stabilize somebody with some retinal disease.
[01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:06.480]   So we come up with some molecule
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.220]   that can improve the stability of somebody
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:12.140]   with retinal degeneration.
[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:16.680]   Just a small tweak to that to say,
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:19.940]   make a virus that causes the human race to become blind.
[01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:22.260]   I mean, it sounds really conspiracy theory-ish,
[01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:25.660]   but it's not.
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:27.420]   We're learning so much about biology
[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:28.740]   and there's always nefarious reasons.
[01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:33.740]   I mean, heck, look at how AI and just Google searches,
[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:37.740]   those can be, they are every single day
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:39.900]   being leveraged by nefarious actors
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:43.140]   to take advantage of people, to steal money,
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:44.840]   to do whatever it might be.
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:48.260]   Eventually, probably to create wars
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:50.380]   or already to create wars.
[01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:53.660]   And I mean, I don't think there's any question at this point
[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.460]   behind disinformation campaigns.
[01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:56.860]   And so it's being leveraged.
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:59.740]   This thing that could be wholly good
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:02.220]   is always going to be leveraged for bad.
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:04.540]   And so how do you balance that as a species?
[01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:06.260]   I'm not quite sure.
[01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:08.260]   - The hope is, as you mentioned previously,
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:10.460]   that there's some, that we're able
[01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:12.300]   to also develop defense mechanisms.
[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:14.060]   And there's something about the human species
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:18.700]   that seems to keep coming up with ways to,
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:22.780]   just like on the deadline, just at the last moment,
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:26.380]   figuring out how to avoid destruction.
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:29.900]   I think I'm like eternally optimistic
[01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:32.740]   about the human race not destroying ourselves,
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:36.040]   but you could do a lot of things that would be very painful.
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:36.900]   - Yes.
[01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:37.900]   Well, we're doing it already.
[01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:40.140]   You know, just, I mean, we are seeing
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:42.940]   how our regulation today.
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:45.800]   We did this thing, it started as a good thing,
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:48.020]   regulation of medical products,
[01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:52.420]   but now it is, you know, unwillingly
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:54.980]   and unintentionally harming us.
[01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:57.180]   Our regulatory landscape,
[01:44:57.180 --> 01:45:00.500]   which was developed wholly for good in our country,
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:04.020]   is getting in the way of us deploying a tool
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:06.860]   that could stop our economies
[01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:11.000]   from having to be sort of sputteringly closed,
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.900]   that could stop deaths from happening
[01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:14.580]   at the rate that they are.
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:19.300]   And it's, you know, I think we will come to a solution,
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:21.040]   of course, now we're gonna get the vaccine
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:23.160]   and it's gonna make people lose track
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:25.880]   of like why we even bother testing, which is a bad idea.
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:29.780]   But we're already seeing that we have this amazing capacity
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:34.780]   to both do damage when we don't intend to do damage
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:38.980]   and then also to pull up when we need to pull up
[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:41.420]   and, you know, stop complete catastrophe.
[01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:46.060]   And so we are an interesting species in that way,
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:47.540]   that's for sure.
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:50.740]   - So there's a lot of young folks, undergrads,
[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:54.140]   grads, they're also young, listen to this.
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:57.500]   So is there, you've talked about a lot of fascinating stuff
[01:45:57.500 --> 01:46:01.900]   that's like, there's ways that things are done
[01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:03.540]   and there's actual solutions
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:05.860]   and they're not always like intersecting.
[01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:09.300]   Do you have advice for undergraduate students
[01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:12.980]   or graduate students or even people in high school now
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:15.900]   about a life, about a career,
[01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:19.460]   of how they might be able to solve real big problems
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:22.140]   in the world, how they should live their life
[01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:24.180]   in order to have a chance to solve big problems
[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:25.460]   in the world?
[01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:27.740]   - It's hard, I struggle a little bit sometimes
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:30.060]   to give advice because the advice that I give
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:32.900]   from my own personal experience is necessarily distinct
[01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:36.580]   from the advice that would make other people successful.
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:41.580]   I have unending ambitions to make things better, I suppose.
[01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:45.540]   And I don't see barricades where other people
[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:46.980]   sometimes see barricades.
[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:51.740]   Now even just little things like when this virus started,
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:54.420]   I'm a medical director at Brigham and Women's Hospital
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:56.180]   and so I oversee or helped oversee
[01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:58.100]   molecular virology diagnostics.
[01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:02.220]   So when this virus started, wearing my epidemiology hat
[01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:04.580]   and wearing my sort of viral outbreak hat,
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:06.720]   I recognized that this was gonna be a big virus
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.780]   that was important at a global level.
[01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:11.060]   Even if the CDC and WHO weren't ready to admit
[01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:13.380]   that it was a pandemic, it was obvious in January
[01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:15.020]   that it was a pandemic.
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:19.060]   So I started trying to get a test built at the Brigham,
[01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:21.380]   which is one of Harvard's teaching hospitals.
[01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:26.900]   The first encounters I had with the upper administration
[01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:29.700]   of the hospital were pretty much no, why would we do that?
[01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:31.740]   That's silly, who are you?
[01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:35.120]   And I said, well, okay, don't believe me, sure.
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:37.020]   But I kept pushing on it.
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:39.820]   And then eventually I got them to agree.
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:41.820]   It was really only a couple of weeks
[01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:44.140]   before the Biogen conference happened.
[01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:45.660]   We started building the test.
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:47.260]   I think they started looking abroad and saying,
[01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:49.020]   okay, this is happening, sure.
[01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:51.620]   Maybe he was right.
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:53.940]   But then I went a step further and I said,
[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:57.860]   we're not gonna have enough tests at the hospital.
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:00.420]   And so my ambition was to get
[01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:02.860]   a better testing program started.
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:06.620]   And so I figured what better place to scale up testing
[01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:08.160]   than the Broad Institute?
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:10.700]   Broad Institute is amazing, very high throughput,
[01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:12.740]   high efficiency research institute
[01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:15.620]   that does a lot of genomic sequencing, things like that.
[01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:17.440]   So I went to the Broad and I said,
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:19.540]   hey, there's this coronavirus
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:23.100]   that's obviously gonna impact our society greatly.
[01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:27.460]   Can we start modifying your high efficiency instruments
[01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:30.180]   and robots for coronavirus testing?
[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:35.180]   Everyone in my orbit in the hospital world
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:37.780]   just said, that's ridiculous.
[01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:39.700]   How could you possibly plan to do that?
[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:40.820]   It's impossible.
[01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:45.760]   And to me, it was like the most dead simple thing to do.
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:50.220]   But the higher ups and the people who think about,
[01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:51.540]   I think one of the most important things
[01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:54.100]   is to recognize that most people in the world
[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:56.020]   don't see solutions, they just see problems.
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:58.420]   And it's 'cause it's an easy thing to do.
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:02.660]   Thinking of problems and how things will go wrong
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:05.540]   is really easy 'cause you're not coming up
[01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:07.220]   with a brand new solution.
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:09.440]   And this to me was just a super simple solution.
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:11.940]   Hey, let's get the Broad to help build tests.
[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:14.980]   Every single hospital director told me no,
[01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:15.820]   like it's impossible.
[01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:18.900]   My own superiors, the ones I report to in the hospital,
[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:22.060]   said, Mike, you're a new faculty member.
[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:25.660]   Your ideas probably would be right,
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:29.860]   but you're too naive and young to know that it's impossible.
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:33.620]   Obviously now the Broad is the highest throughput laboratory
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:34.460]   in the country.
[01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:39.260]   And so I think my recommendation to people
[01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:40.740]   is as much as possible,
[01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:45.060]   get out of the mode of thinking about things as problems.
[01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:46.720]   Sometimes you piss people off.
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:49.540]   I could probably use a better filter sometimes
[01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:53.660]   to try to be not so upfront with certain things,
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:57.020]   but it's just so crucial to always just see,
[01:49:57.020 --> 01:49:59.860]   to just bring it, think about things in new ways
[01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:01.740]   that other people haven't.
[01:50:01.740 --> 01:50:03.740]   'Cause usually there's something else out there.
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:06.460]   And one of the things that has been most beneficial to me,
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:10.200]   which is that my education was really broad.
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:12.700]   It was engineering and physics.
[01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:15.900]   And well, and then I became a Buddhist monk for a while.
[01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:18.540]   And so that gave me a different perspective.
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:20.820]   But then it was medicine and immunology.
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:23.100]   And now I've brought all of it together
[01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:27.780]   from a mathematics and biology and medicine perspective
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:29.100]   and policy and public health.
[01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:30.900]   And I think that I'm not the best
[01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:32.980]   in any one of these things.
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:36.100]   I recognize that there are gonna be geniuses out there
[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:37.680]   who are just worlds better than me
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.660]   at any one of these things that I try to work on.
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:44.220]   But my superpower is bringing them all together
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:45.060]   and just thinking.
[01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:48.580]   And that's, I think, how you can really change the world.
[01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:51.500]   I don't know that I'll ever change the world
[01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:53.780]   in the way that I hope.
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:55.300]   - But that's how you can have a chance.
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:57.060]   - Yeah, that's how you can have a chance, exactly.
[01:50:57.060 --> 01:51:00.820]   And I think it's also what,
[01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:02.780]   this to me, this rapid testing program,
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:06.180]   this is the most dead simple solution in the world.
[01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:07.580]   - And this literally could change the world.
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:08.420]   - It could change the world.
[01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:09.600]   And it is.
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:11.160]   There's countries that are doing it now.
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:13.960]   The US isn't, but I've been advising many countries on it.
[01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:18.160]   And I would say that some of the early papers
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:19.860]   that we put out earlier on,
[01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:22.280]   a lot of the things actually are changing.
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:24.160]   You don't always, unless you really look hard,
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:26.720]   you don't know where you're actually having an effect.
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:29.600]   Sometimes it's more overt than other times.
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:33.240]   In April, I published a paper that was saying,
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:36.580]   hey, with the PCR values from these tests,
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:38.560]   we need to really focus on the CT values,
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:42.560]   the actual quantitative values of these lab-based PCR tests.
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:46.000]   At the time, all the physicians and laboratory directors
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.240]   told me that was stupid.
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:48.160]   Why would you do that?
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:49.520]   They're not accurate enough.
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:53.380]   And of course, now it's headline news that in Florida,
[01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:56.840]   they just mandated reporting out the CT values of these tests
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:58.960]   'cause there's a real utility of them.
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:00.520]   You can understand public health from it.
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:02.760]   You can understand better clinical management.
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:07.460]   That was a simple solution to a pretty difficult problem.
[01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:11.180]   And it is changing the way that we approach
[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:12.660]   all of the lab testing in this country.
[01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:14.660]   It's starting to, it's taken a few months,
[01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:16.620]   but it's starting to change because of that.
[01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:19.380]   And that was just me saying,
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:21.580]   hey, this is something we should be focusing on.
[01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:24.100]   Got some other people involved and other people,
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:27.260]   and now people recognize, hey, there's actual value
[01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:30.220]   in this number that comes out of these lab-based PCR tests.
[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:33.120]   So sometimes it does grow fairly quickly.
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:37.740]   But I think the real answer, my only answer,
[01:52:37.740 --> 01:52:40.340]   I don't know what, I recognize that everyone,
[01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:42.540]   some people are gonna be really focused on
[01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:46.100]   and have one small but deep skillset.
[01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:47.340]   I go the opposite direction.
[01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:49.860]   I try to bring things together.
[01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:55.540]   But the biggest thing I think is just don't see barriers.
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:59.220]   Like just see, like there's always a solution to a barrier.
[01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:00.780]   If there's a barrier, that literally means
[01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:02.420]   there's a solution to it.
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:03.560]   That's why it's called a barrier.
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:07.240]   - And just like you said, most people will just present to,
[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:09.240]   or only be thinking about it and present to you
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:11.940]   with barriers, and so it's easy to start thinking
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:13.840]   that's all there is in this world.
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:14.720]   - And just think big.
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:18.320]   I mean, God, there's nothing wrong with thinking big.
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:22.320]   Elon Musk thought big, and then thinking big builds
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:23.160]   on itself, you know?
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:26.280]   You get a billion dollars from one big idea,
[01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:28.880]   and then that allows you to make three new big ideas.
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:31.000]   - And there's a hunger for it if you think big
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.320]   and you communicate that vision with the world,
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:37.500]   all the most brilliant and passionate people will just like,
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.840]   you'll attract them, and they'll come to you.
[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:42.500]   And then it makes your life actually really exciting.
[01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:46.340]   The people I've met at like Tesla and Neuralink,
[01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:48.280]   I mean, there's just like this fire in their eyes.
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:51.220]   They just love life, and it's amazing, I think,
[01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:53.360]   to be around those people.
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:58.900]   I have to ask you about what was the philosophy,
[01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:02.180]   the journey that took you to becoming a Buddhist monk,
[01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:07.180]   and what did you learn about life?
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:09.100]   What did you take away from that experience?
[01:54:09.100 --> 01:54:12.340]   How did you return back to Harvard
[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:17.340]   and the world that's unlike that experience, I imagine?
[01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:19.680]   - Yeah, well, I was at Dartmouth at the time.
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:23.380]   Well, I went to Sri Lanka.
[01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:25.820]   I was already pretty interested in developing countries
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:27.460]   and sort of under-resourced areas,
[01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:30.700]   and I was doing a lot of engineering work,
[01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:33.420]   and I went there, but I was also starting to think
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:35.760]   maybe health was something of interest.
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:40.840]   And so I went to Sri Lanka
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:43.540]   because I had a long interest in Buddhism as well,
[01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:46.660]   just kind of interested in it as a thing.
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:49.200]   - Which aspect of the philosophy attracted you?
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:52.540]   - I would say that the thing that interested me most
[01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:57.080]   was really this idea of kind of a butterfly effect
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:02.080]   of like what you do now has ripple effects
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:06.280]   that extend out beyond what you can possibly imagine,
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:10.620]   both in your own life and in other people's lives.
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:13.140]   And in some ways, Buddhism has, not in some ways,
[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:14.960]   in a pretty deep way, Buddhism has that
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:19.820]   as part of its underlying philosophy in terms of rebirth
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:24.820]   and sort of your actions today propagate to others,
[01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:30.000]   but also propagate to sort of what might happen
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.600]   in your circle of what's called samsara and rebirth.
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:36.600]   And I don't know that I subscribe fully
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:39.840]   to this idea that we are reborn,
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:44.840]   which always was a little bit of a debate internally,
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:46.300]   I suppose, when I was a monk.
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:50.440]   But it has always been, it was that,
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:52.520]   and then it was also meditation.
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:55.400]   At the time I was a fairly elite rower,
[01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:57.840]   I was rowing at the national level,
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:01.600]   and rowing to me was very meditative.
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:06.600]   It was just, even if you're in a boat with other people,
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:09.520]   I mean, on the one hand, it's like the extreme
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:13.120]   of like a team sport, but it's also the extreme
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:16.720]   sort of focus and concentration that's required of it.
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:18.840]   And so I was always really into just meditative
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:20.840]   type of things, I was doing a lot of pottery too,
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:22.400]   which was also very meditative.
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:25.680]   And so Buddhism just kind of really,
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:28.400]   there are a lot of things about meditating
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:30.600]   that just appealed.
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:32.280]   And so I moved to Sri Lanka,
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:34.740]   planning to only be there for a couple of months.
[01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:37.720]   But then I was shadowing in this medical clinic,
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:40.340]   and there was this physician who was just really,
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:43.400]   I mean, it's just kind of a horrible situation, frankly.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:46.000]   This guy was trained decades earlier,
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.560]   he was an older physician, and he was still just practicing
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:52.480]   like these fairly barbaric approaches to medicine,
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:55.520]   'cause he was a rural town,
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:57.160]   and he just didn't have a lot of,
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:00.640]   he didn't have any updated training, frankly.
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:03.640]   And so I just remember this girl came in
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:05.880]   with shrapnel in her hand,
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:08.720]   and his solution was to air it out.
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:12.400]   And so he was like, without even numbing her hand,
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:15.920]   he was cutting it open more,
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:19.200]   with this idea that the more oxygen and stuff,
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:23.000]   and it just, I think there was something about all of this,
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.520]   and I was already talking to these monks at the time,
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:27.240]   I would be in this clinic in the morning,
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:31.520]   and I'd go, and my idea was to teach English
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:33.060]   to these monks in the evening.
[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:37.080]   Turned out I'm a really bad English teacher.
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:39.320]   So they just taught, they allowed me
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:41.260]   just to sit with them and meditate,
[01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:42.960]   and they were teaching me more about Buddhism
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:44.800]   than I could have possibly taught them about English,
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:46.500]   or being an American or something.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:52.800]   And so I just slowly, I just couldn't take,
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:55.240]   I couldn't handle being in that clinic.
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:57.320]   So more and more, I just started moving,
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:59.440]   spending more and more time at this monastery.
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:00.760]   And then after about two months,
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:02.200]   I was supposed to come back to the States,
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:04.160]   and I decided I didn't want to.
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:06.460]   So I moved to this monastery in the mountains,
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:09.180]   primarily because I didn't have the money
[01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:11.200]   to just keep living.
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:13.540]   So living in a monastery is free.
[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:16.240]   And so I moved there, and just started meditating
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:17.640]   more and more, and then months went by,
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:22.120]   and I just really gravitated.
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:24.800]   I gravitated to the whole notion of it.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:28.400]   I mean, it became, it sounds strange,
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:30.680]   but meditating almost, just like anything
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:34.560]   that you put your mind to, became exciting.
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:36.480]   It became like there weren't enough hours
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:38.100]   in the day to meditate.
[01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:41.740]   And I would do it for 18 hours a day, 15 hours a day.
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:48.160]   Just sit there, and I mean, I hate sleeping anyway,
[01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:49.880]   but I wouldn't want to go to sleep
[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:51.440]   because I felt like I didn't accomplish
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:54.120]   what I needed to accomplish in meditation that day,
[01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:56.280]   which is so strange, 'cause there is no end.
[01:58:56.280 --> 01:59:01.480]   But it was always, but there are these steps
[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:02.800]   that happen during meditation
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:05.160]   that are very prescribed in a way.
[01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:06.680]   Buddha talked about them,
[01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:08.720]   and these are ancient writings, which exist.
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:09.840]   I mean, the writings are real.
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:11.240]   They're thousands of years old now.
[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:16.240]   And so whether it was Buddha writing them or whoever,
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:17.760]   there are lots of different people
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:20.560]   who have contributed to these writings over the years.
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:23.520]   But they're very prescribed,
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:26.880]   and they tell you what you're gonna go through.
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:29.040]   And I didn't really focus too much on them.
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:31.240]   I read a little bit about them,
[01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:32.420]   but your mind really does.
[01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:35.160]   When you actually start meditating at that level,
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:36.440]   like not an hour here and there,
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:39.560]   but truly just spending your day as meditating,
[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:42.320]   it becomes kind of like this other world
[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:43.920]   where it becomes exciting,
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:49.380]   and you're actively working, you're actively meditating,
[01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:51.200]   not just kind of trying to quiet things.
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:53.360]   That's sort of just the first stage
[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:54.940]   of trying to get your mind to focus.
[01:59:54.940 --> 01:59:56.780]   Most people never get past that first stage,
[01:59:56.780 --> 01:59:58.680]   especially in our culture.
[01:59:58.680 --> 02:00:01.760]   - Could you briefly summarize what's waiting
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:03.980]   beyond the stage of just quieting the mind?
[02:00:03.980 --> 02:00:08.320]   It's hard for me to imagine that there's something
[02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:12.400]   that could be described as exciting there.
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:14.640]   - Yeah, it's an interesting question.
[02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:18.140]   So I would say, so the first thing,
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:22.080]   the first step is truly just to be able to close your eyes,
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:23.080]   focus on your breath,
[02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:26.280]   and not have other thoughts enter into your mind.
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:28.240]   That alone is just so hard to do.
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:33.560]   I couldn't do it now if I wanted, but I could then.
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:38.520]   But once you get past that stage,
[02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:41.600]   you start entering into all these other,
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:42.440]   you go through a kind of,
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:44.640]   I went through this pretty trippy stage,
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:46.280]   which is a little bit euphoric,
[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:49.800]   where you just kind of start not hallucinating.
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:51.440]   I mean, it wasn't like some crazy thing
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:53.080]   that would happen in a movie,
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:55.320]   but definitely just weird.
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:56.720]   You start getting to the stage
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:01.720]   where you're able to quiet your mind for so long,
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:03.220]   for hours at a time, that,
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:07.640]   for me, I started getting really excited
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:09.640]   about this idea of mindfulness,
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:11.760]   which is part of Buddhism in general,
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:13.760]   but it's part of Theravada Buddhism in particular
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:15.640]   for this, in this way, which was,
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:21.600]   you take, you start focusing on your daily activities,
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:23.960]   whether that's sipping a cup of tea,
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:28.960]   or walking, or sweeping around.
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:32.360]   I lived on this mountainside in this cottage thing,
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:33.420]   it was built into the rock,
[02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:36.280]   and so every morning I would wake up early
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:37.600]   and sweep around it and stuff,
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:39.100]   'cause that's just what we did.
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:44.000]   And you start to, you meditate on all those activities,
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.240]   and one of the things that was so exciting,
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:48.720]   which sounds completely ridiculous now,
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:53.720]   was just almost learning about your daily activities
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:56.880]   in ways that you never would have thought about before.
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:00.480]   So what is, what's involved
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:02.320]   with picking up this glass of water?
[02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:05.140]   You know, if I said, okay, I'm just gonna pick,
[02:02:05.140 --> 02:02:06.820]   I'm gonna take a drink of water,
[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:09.500]   to me right now, it's a single activity, right?
[02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:14.500]   You just, but during meditation,
[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:16.340]   it's not a single activity,
[02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:18.160]   it's a whole series of activities,
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:21.940]   of like little engineering feats and feelings,
[02:02:21.940 --> 02:02:24.240]   and it's gripping the water,
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:25.960]   and it's feeling that the glass is cold,
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:27.940]   and it's lifting, and it's moving,
[02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:29.020]   and dragging, and dragging,
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:34.200]   and you start to learn a whole new language of life.
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:37.540]   And that, to me, was like this really exhilarating thing,
[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:41.320]   that it was an exhilarating component of meditation,
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:43.680]   that there was never enough time,
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:46.360]   it's kind of like learning a new computer language,
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:48.280]   like it gets really exciting when you start coding
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:50.480]   and all these new things you can do.
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:53.200]   - You learn how to much,
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:55.400]   to experience life in a much richer way,
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:57.000]   and so you never run out of ways
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.140]   to go deeper, and deeper, and deeper in the way
[02:02:59.140 --> 02:03:02.340]   you experience just the drinking of the glass of water.
[02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:03.260]   - That's exactly right,
[02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:05.860]   and what becomes kind of exhilarating is,
[02:03:05.860 --> 02:03:09.040]   you start to be able to predict things that you never,
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:11.180]   or I don't even know if prediction's the right word,
[02:03:11.180 --> 02:03:12.420]   but I always think of the Matrix,
[02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:15.180]   you know, or I forget who it was,
[02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:17.900]   somebody was shooting at Neo,
[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:19.700]   and he like leans backwards,
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:21.080]   and he dodges the bullets.
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:23.460]   You know, in some ways,
[02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:25.380]   when you start breaking every little action
[02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:26.940]   that your hands do, or that your feet do,
[02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:27.820]   or that your body does,
[02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:29.520]   down into all these little actions
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:33.340]   that make up one, what we normally think of as an action,
[02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:35.360]   all of a sudden, you can start to see things
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:37.100]   almost in slow motion.
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:40.280]   I like to think of it very much like language.
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:42.720]   The first time somebody hears a foreign language,
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:45.980]   it sounds really fast, usually.
[02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:48.980]   You don't hear the spaces between words,
[02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:52.180]   and it just sounds like,
[02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:54.020]   just like a stream of conscious,
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:55.680]   and it just sounds like a stream of noises,
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:57.060]   if you've never heard the language before.
[02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:58.740]   And as you learn the language,
[02:03:58.740 --> 02:04:01.220]   you hear clear breaks between words,
[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:02.820]   and it starts to gain context,
[02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:04.340]   and all of a sudden, like that,
[02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:06.740]   what once sounded very fast,
[02:04:06.740 --> 02:04:10.160]   slows down, and it has meaning.
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:11.420]   That's our whole life.
[02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:13.060]   Well, there's this whole language happening
[02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:15.540]   that we don't speak, generally.
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:17.140]   But if you start to speak it,
[02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:18.340]   and if you start to learn it,
[02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:19.860]   and you start to say,
[02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:21.060]   hey, I'm picking up this glass
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:24.060]   is actually 18 little movements,
[02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:27.260]   then all of a sudden, it becomes extremely exciting,
[02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:29.460]   and exhilarating to just breathe.
[02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:31.640]   Breathing alone, and the rise and fall of your abdomen,
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:34.100]   or the way the air pushes in and out of your nose,
[02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:36.640]   becomes almost interesting.
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:39.520]   And what's really neat is the world
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:41.520]   just starts slowing down.
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:44.120]   And I'll never forget that feeling.
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:47.140]   And if there was one euphoric feeling from meditation
[02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:48.940]   I want to gain back,
[02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:49.880]   but I don't think I could
[02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:52.140]   without really meditating like that again,
[02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:53.340]   and I don't think I will.
[02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:56.980]   Was this slow motion of the world.
[02:04:56.980 --> 02:05:01.380]   It was finding the spaces between all the movements
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:02.480]   in the same way that the spaces
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:04.620]   between all the words happen.
[02:05:04.620 --> 02:05:05.860]   And then it almost gives you
[02:05:05.860 --> 02:05:07.860]   this new appreciation for everything.
[02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:10.100]   You know, it was really amazing.
[02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:14.180]   And so I think it came to an abrupt end, though,
[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:15.380]   when the tsunami hit.
[02:05:15.380 --> 02:05:18.580]   I was there when the Indian Ocean tsunami hit in 2004.
[02:05:18.580 --> 02:05:22.140]   And it was like this dichotomy of being a monk,
[02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:26.600]   and just meditating in this extraordinary place.
[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:30.660]   And then the tsunami hits and kills 40,000 people
[02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:32.220]   in a few minutes on the coast
[02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:34.900]   of this really small little country in Sri Lanka.
[02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:37.380]   And then I,
[02:05:37.380 --> 02:05:41.700]   it like my whole world of being a monk came crashing down
[02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:46.140]   when I go to the coast.
[02:05:46.140 --> 02:05:50.260]   And I mean, that was just a devastating
[02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:54.460]   visual sight and emotional sight.
[02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:56.500]   But the strangest thing happened,
[02:05:56.500 --> 02:05:59.580]   which was that everyone just wanted me to stay as a monk.
[02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:02.460]   Now people in that culture, they wanted to,
[02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:06.540]   the monks largely fled from the coastlines,
[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:09.700]   those, you know, and so then there I was,
[02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:11.260]   and people wanted me to be a monk.
[02:06:11.260 --> 02:06:12.260]   They wanted me to stay on the coast,
[02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:14.380]   but be a monk and not help,
[02:06:14.380 --> 02:06:17.660]   like not help in the way that I considered helping.
[02:06:17.660 --> 02:06:20.520]   They wanted me just to keep meditating
[02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:23.340]   so that they could bring me dana, like offerings,
[02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:26.940]   and have their sort of karmic responsibilities
[02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:29.300]   attended to as well.
[02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:32.460]   And so that was really bizarre to me.
[02:06:32.460 --> 02:06:36.340]   It was like, how could I possibly just sit around
[02:06:36.340 --> 02:06:37.380]   while all these people,
[02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:40.220]   half of everyone's family just died?
[02:06:40.220 --> 02:06:43.980]   And so in any case, I stopped being a monk,
[02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:45.460]   and I moved to this refugee camp
[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:47.340]   and lived there for another six months or so,
[02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:52.340]   and just stayed there, not as a monk,
[02:06:52.340 --> 02:06:56.560]   but tried to raise some money from the US
[02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:58.840]   and tried to like, I didn't know what I was doing.
[02:06:58.840 --> 02:07:01.560]   Frankly, I was 22.
[02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:06.080]   And I don't think I appreciated at the time
[02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:09.940]   how much of a role I was having in that community's life.
[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:14.600]   But it's taken me many years to process all of this
[02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:16.680]   since then, but I would say
[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:19.160]   it's what put me into the public health world,
[02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:21.060]   living in that refugee camp.
[02:07:21.060 --> 02:07:23.720]   And that difference that happened from being a monk
[02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:26.880]   to being in this devastating environment
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:30.120]   just really changed my whole view
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:34.640]   of what sort of why I was existing, I suppose.
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:39.640]   - Well, so there's this richness of life
[02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:42.640]   in a single drink of water that you experience,
[02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:46.160]   and then there's this power of nature
[02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:50.040]   that's capable to take the lives of thousands of people.
[02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:52.480]   So given all that, the absurdity of that,
[02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:58.140]   let me ask you, and the fact that you study things
[02:07:58.140 --> 02:08:01.200]   that could kill the entirety of human civilization,
[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:03.800]   what do you think is the meaning of this all?
[02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:05.540]   What do you think is the meaning of life,
[02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:08.040]   this whole orchestra we've got going on?
[02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:09.960]   Does it have a meaning?
[02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:12.720]   And maybe from another perspective,
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:19.120]   how does one live a meaningful life if such is possible?
[02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:24.540]   - Well, from what I've seen,
[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:29.080]   I don't think there's a single answer to that by any stretch.
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:32.280]   One of the most interesting things about Buddhism to me
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:35.840]   is that the human existence is part of suffering,
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:40.940]   which is very different from Judeo-Christian existence,
[02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:45.940]   which is that human existence is something to be,
[02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:50.220]   is a very different, it's something to,
[02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:51.680]   there's a richness to it.
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:55.400]   In Buddhism, it's just another one of your lives,
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:59.620]   but it's your opportunity to attain nirvana
[02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:01.580]   and become a monk, for example,
[02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:03.480]   and meditate to attain nirvana.
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:06.820]   Else you kind of just go back into the samsara,
[02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:09.140]   the cycle of suffering.
[02:09:09.140 --> 02:09:14.140]   And so, when I look at, I mean, in some ways,
[02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:17.900]   the notion of life and what the purpose of life is,
[02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:20.900]   they're kind of completely distinct,
[02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:22.940]   this sort of Western view of life,
[02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:27.180]   which is that this life is the most precious thing
[02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:30.420]   in the world versus this is just another opportunity
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:33.260]   to try to get out of life.
[02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:35.860]   I mean, the whole notion of nirvana and in Buddhism,
[02:09:36.060 --> 02:09:41.060]   getting out of this sort of cycle of suffering is to vanish.
[02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:45.620]   If you could attain nirvana throughout this life,
[02:09:45.620 --> 02:09:48.620]   the idea is that you don't get reborn.
[02:09:48.620 --> 02:09:51.300]   And so, when I look at these two,
[02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:55.060]   on the one hand, you have Christian faith
[02:09:55.060 --> 02:09:57.120]   and other things that want to go to heaven
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:58.900]   and live forever in heaven.
[02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:01.220]   Then you have this other whole half of humans
[02:10:01.220 --> 02:10:05.700]   who want nothing more than to get out of the cycle
[02:10:05.700 --> 02:10:09.060]   of rebirth and just poof, not exist anymore.
[02:10:09.060 --> 02:10:10.260]   - The cycle of suffering, yeah.
[02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:12.460]   - Yeah, and so, how do you reconcile those two?
[02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:13.580]   And I guess--
[02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:15.700]   - Do you have both of them in you?
[02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:17.980]   Do you basically oscillate back and forth?
[02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:19.820]   - I don't think I, I think I just,
[02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:22.940]   I look at us in a, I think we're just a bunch of proteins
[02:10:22.940 --> 02:10:29.580]   that we form and they work in this really amazing way.
[02:10:29.580 --> 02:10:31.380]   And they might work in a bigger scale.
[02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:33.820]   There might be some connections
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:35.380]   that we're not really clear about,
[02:10:35.380 --> 02:10:36.580]   but they're still biological.
[02:10:36.580 --> 02:10:38.340]   I believe that they're biological.
[02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:40.580]   - How do these proteins become conscious
[02:10:40.580 --> 02:10:43.600]   and why do they want to help civilization
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:47.640]   by having at home rapid tests at scale?
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:50.860]   - Well, I think, I don't have an answer to that one,
[02:10:50.860 --> 02:10:54.740]   but I really do believe that it's just,
[02:10:54.740 --> 02:10:59.140]   you know, this is just an evolution of consciousness.
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:02.460]   I don't personally think is,
[02:11:02.460 --> 02:11:05.420]   my feeling is that we're a bunch of pluses and minuses
[02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:07.160]   that have just gotten so complex
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:10.900]   that they're able to make rich feelings, rich emotions.
[02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:13.040]   And I do believe, though, you know,
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:15.760]   on the one hand, I sometimes wake up some days,
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:18.700]   my fiance doesn't always love it,
[02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:20.780]   but I kind of think we're all just a bunch of robots
[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:24.260]   with pretty complicated algorithms that we deal with.
[02:11:24.260 --> 02:11:28.620]   And in that sense, like, okay,
[02:11:28.620 --> 02:11:30.940]   if the world just blew up tomorrow
[02:11:30.940 --> 02:11:35.340]   and nothing existed the day after that,
[02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:37.900]   it's just another blip in the universe, you know?
[02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:40.100]   But at the same time, I don't know.
[02:11:40.100 --> 02:11:42.460]   So that's kind of probably my most core basic feeling
[02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:45.500]   about life is like, we're just a blip
[02:11:45.500 --> 02:11:47.340]   and we may as well make the most of it
[02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:48.640]   while we're here blipping.
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:52.300]   - It's one hell of a fun blip, though.
[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:55.900]   - It is, it's an amazing, you know,
[02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:59.160]   blink of an eye in time.
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:01.000]   - Michael, this is, you're one of the most
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.060]   interesting people I've met,
[02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:03.960]   one of the most interesting conversations,
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:05.320]   important ones now.
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:07.440]   I'm going to publish it very soon.
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:09.760]   I really appreciate taking the time.
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:10.920]   I know how busy you are.
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:12.940]   It was really fun.
[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:14.120]   Thanks for talking today.
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:15.080]   - Well, thanks so much.
[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:16.480]   This was a lot of fun.

[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:25.240]   Brave, a fast browser that feels like Chrome,
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:27.920]   but has more privacy-preserving features.
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:30.520]   Athletic Greens, the all-in-one drink

[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:01.960]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:03.840]   from Teddy Roosevelt.
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:05.920]   "It is not the critic who counts,
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:10.200]   not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:13.640]   or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:17.880]   The credit belongs to the man who actually is in the arena,
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:21.280]   whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood,
[02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:24.520]   who strives valiantly, who errs,
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:27.200]   who comes short again and again,
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:30.720]   because there's no effort without error and shortcoming,
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:33.800]   but who does actually strive to do the deeds,
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:37.480]   who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions,
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:40.280]   who spends himself in a worthy cause,
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:42.980]   who at the best knows in the end
[02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:44.880]   that triumph of high achievement,
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:47.400]   and who at the worst, if he fails,
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:50.600]   at least fails while daring greatly,
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:53.240]   so that his place shall never be
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:55.480]   with those cold and timid souls
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:58.160]   who neither know victory nor defeat."
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:01.920]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
