[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.600]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.040]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.160]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.440]   and one of the areas I love optimizing the most is travel.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.800]   I've been to 60 plus countries,
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.920]   and on every trip, I love meeting locals,
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.360]   trying to understand their culture,
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.240]   having authentic experiences,
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.840]   and most of all, I love finding a way to eat
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.060]   all the best foods a place has to offer.
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.200]   So I thought it'd be fun to introduce a new type of episode
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.960]   where I bring in a local expert in another country
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.640]   to share all the hacks for visiting their city.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.160]   I was originally gonna start with Japan
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.780]   because it just opened, I have the perfect person in mind,
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.480]   and it's probably my favorite travel destination in the world
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.800]   but that episode will be next
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.840]   because after my episode with Bill Perkins,
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.760]   which is amazing if you haven't checked it out,
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.000]   I started talking with Amy
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.520]   about how we could start optimizing
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.560]   for more net fulfillment in our lives.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.040]   And so we actually decided to book
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.120]   a last minute trip to London on less than two weeks notice
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.500]   and ended up getting a ridiculous deal with points,
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.600]   which I will talk about at the end of this episode.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.920]   So with a trip to London on the horizon,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.360]   I reached out to Jessica Dante,
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.200]   who not only has been living there for almost a decade,
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.280]   but runs the Love in London YouTube channel,
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.960]   which has over 20 million views
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.240]   and she knows so much about London.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.880]   We're gonna get into why you should visit,
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.280]   what you should do, what mistakes to avoid,
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.820]   and get all of Jess's secret spots to visit
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.600]   to have an incredible trip.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.320]   And then after talking to Jess,
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.360]   I'm gonna break down exactly how I booked my trip
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.440]   and give you an overview of the best way
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.360]   you can be using your points and your miles
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.480]   and even scoring some deals on a trip to London.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.980]   So let's get into it right after this.
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.320]   Jess, thank you for joining
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.920]   the first travel destination episode of All The Hacks.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.800]   - Amazing, thanks for having me.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.480]   Really happy that London is the first, I'm not gonna lie.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.760]   I think I'm a little biased,
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.680]   but I think it's maybe the best in my opinion.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.520]   Depends on who you ask.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.340]   - It's not just you.
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.660]   So someone shared me this list from afar,
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.480]   the website and magazine afar.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.800]   There was the 10 best cities and London was number one.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.640]   And there was another study on the best cities
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.720]   and London was number one.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.800]   It just came out also for 2023.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.200]   And then I looked at travel and leisures,
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.960]   best destinations for 2023 and London's on that list.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.740]   So I was like, wow, so London's the number one city.
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.540]   It wasn't even just to live or to travel.
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.020]   It was just the number one city on two lists.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.600]   So I think I wanna ask you, why do you love London?
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.080]   What is it about London that makes it such an amazing city?
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.880]   - Oh my gosh, well, there's so many things,
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.160]   but I think a couple of the top things are,
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160]   I love how diverse that the city is.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.440]   So that goes from the people that live here
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.700]   to the architecture, to the types of cuisines
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.520]   that you can try here.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.040]   You just meet so many different people
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.680]   with so many different backgrounds.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.640]   You can eat so much amazing food
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.280]   and you can experience so many different things,
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.520]   no matter what your interest is or what your budget is.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.440]   There's just basically something for everyone,
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.800]   whether you live here or you just come to visit.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.720]   So I love that.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.200]   And as someone who works telling people
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.320]   what to do in London,
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.440]   I don't wanna ever get bored and I never will
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.440]   because there's so much to experience.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.680]   It's always changing too.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.280]   So I'm gonna be here for like 30 years
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.520]   and there's still gonna be more for me to check out.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.760]   And I'll be like, I haven't been there yet.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.300]   Gotta go check that out and see if it's good or not.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.660]   - Is there something that sets it apart
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.680]   from other major metros that of course have diversity,
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.200]   have lots of restaurants, have lots of things to do?
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.040]   - Yeah.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.400]   So I think London is a really interesting in between,
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.880]   in my opinion, of like New York and the rest of Europe.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.760]   So I'm originally from New York.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.380]   I'm from Long Island, but I've spent time in New York.
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.680]   Obviously I have friends who live there.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.760]   And New York City is go, go, go, right?
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.860]   Which I love.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.080]   I love that energy and it's really intense.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.060]   And then very generally speaking,
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.000]   a lot of parts of mainland Europe are a lot more relaxed
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.240]   when it comes to working culture.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.000]   Basically all of the culture,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.780]   it's seen as like a lot more relaxed and liberal,
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.640]   whereas London's kind of like in the middle.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.600]   So it's a really good balance for me.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.620]   And I think like a couple of good examples of that
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.560]   is our work-life balance is better here.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.880]   So people are a bit better than say New York
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.720]   about like actually leaving work at six o'clock,
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.400]   mainly 'cause people wanna get to the pub,
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.640]   which I'm totally down for.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.140]   I think that's a great motivation
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.380]   if that's your motivation.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.260]   Something that's also really unique about London
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.560]   that as someone who lives here,
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.840]   I really feel is like super important
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.620]   is that we have so much green space here.
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.120]   So compared to my time in New York and other major cities,
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.460]   London's really spread out
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.060]   and you're really actually never that far
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.380]   from a beautiful public free green space that you can enjoy.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.540]   And I think that works actually for tourists as well.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.940]   And it's one of the beautiful things you can experience
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.460]   when you come to visit London too.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.320]   So we have green spaces, we have going to a pub.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.220]   Are there a few other like top London experiences for you?
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.420]   Not for anyone else, just for you.
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.700]   Yeah, so I love Sunday roast.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.540]   Do you know what Sunday roast is?
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.380]   No. Okay.
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.660]   So it's a British tradition
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.460]   of obviously it happens on Sundays
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.660]   where you go to the pub and on the menu,
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.620]   only on Sundays they have this special roast menu.
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.460]   And you choose from different types of meat.
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.380]   So it's usually chicken, pork, beef,
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.780]   and sometimes a couple other ones
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.580]   or loads of places do vegetarian,
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.380]   which is where I usually go for and also vegan.
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.140]   And then basically from the Americans,
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.620]   I always kind of equate it to,
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.660]   they bring this plate out
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.560]   and it's not dissimilar to Thanksgiving food.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.220]   It's kind of like you can have Thanksgiving
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.340]   like every Sunday.
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.980]   It's a plate that has roast vegetables on it.
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.740]   There's really good potatoes.
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.080]   They do gravy.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.060]   There's this kind of like a pastry
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.980]   that's called Yorkshire pudding,
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.100]   which is like so yummy.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.100]   And you use that to soak up the gravy.
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.420]   And sometimes there's cauliflower cheese.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.900]   And it's just like a really nice tradition
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.460]   where you gather up your family
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.700]   or you gather up your friends
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.180]   and you're like, let's go for a Sunday roast.
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.860]   And you just go to the local pub
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.580]   and sit and you eat Sunday roast.
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.260]   And if you want to have a pint of beer,
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.300]   you can do that too.
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.780]   So that's one of my favorite things.
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.820]   I always tell people to make sure you get to a pub
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.140]   on a Sunday and experience that.
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.700]   - What sounds like one thing that is uniquely London
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.020]   is that the pub is something
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.260]   that you could do with your family.
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260]   I'm thinking as someone flying overseas
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.660]   with a two-year-old and a six-month-old,
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.660]   I'm like, oh, you know,
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.260]   we're not really gonna have the same trip we used to.
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.100]   It sounds like in London,
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.500]   I could just go to the pub with my kids
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.340]   and we could have a beer.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.180]   - You can, yeah.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.060]   So pubs are very family-friendly,
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.340]   especially on the weekends.
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.860]   They're not as friendly in very central London,
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.440]   so around like the really main touristy areas.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.460]   But for example, one of my favorite areas
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.980]   that I tell people to go to for pub experience
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.100]   is Notting Hill.
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.740]   And you'll always on a weekend
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.380]   go to the pubs in Notting Hill and see families there.
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.740]   And they've got little kids, they've got teenagers,
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.460]   and it's like a family thing.
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.300]   Sometimes it's big groups of families that will go,
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.100]   and it's very normal.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.460]   They cater to kids,
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.220]   so it's like nothing out of the ordinary.
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.180]   And it's a really nice daytime weekend experience
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.140]   for families.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.980]   - Awesome.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.420]   So while I'm actually planning a trip to London,
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.300]   we've already booked flights and where we're staying,
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.820]   I'm gonna assume most people aren't.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.940]   So I wanna start this
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.540]   and just talk about all the awesome things there are to do,
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.660]   get people excited,
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.420]   and then at the end, we can wrap up
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.500]   and talk about things like hotels, flights,
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.980]   transportation, that kind of stuff.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.100]   What's the vibe of people in London?
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.180]   Is it easy to meet people?
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.020]   Are they friendly?
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.540]   What should we know about Londoners?
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.700]   - So Londoners are very nice,
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.760]   but we're a little bit more closed off
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.500]   when it comes to meeting quote unquote outsiders.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.580]   I think it comes from that everyone's just really busy.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.540]   And the British are just a tiny bit more closed off
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.740]   compared to the Americans,
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.900]   which everyone's a little bit more closed off
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.820]   that I think compared to us Americans, right?
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.260]   So that's not a hard feat.
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.420]   That being said,
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.500]   if you do end up talking to somebody who lives in London,
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.340]   generally they will be very nice.
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.460]   And if you, for example, need like help on the street
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.100]   and you can't figure out where the tube station is,
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.700]   you can stop somebody and they'll be like,
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.540]   "Yeah, yeah, no worries.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.940]   "It's just like down that way."
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.580]   Or they might even walk you.
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.300]   But it is a little bit harder to meet people.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.820]   That does change though when alcohol is involved.
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.740]   It's much easier to make friends
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.460]   when everyone's had a couple of pints.
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.940]   - Is there a type of person you think
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.260]   a trip to London is best for?
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.380]   Is it young, old, single, kids?
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.980]   - Ooh, I don't think so.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.620]   Because there is so much that you can do here,
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.780]   I think that everyone's basically covered.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.500]   I think people that come with kids,
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.740]   maybe it's a little bit harder
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.460]   because if you're trying to use public transportation,
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.500]   it is trickier if you've got like a lot of stuff
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.860]   that you're carrying or if you've got strollers.
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.460]   That is tricky because a lot of the tube stations
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.660]   don't have escalators or elevators.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:44.820]   So that's tricky.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.820]   That being said though,
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.980]   if you're staying pretty central and you've got kids,
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.060]   a lot of people end up just walking everywhere.
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.900]   So maybe they'll do like an hour walk
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.100]   to get to the first area that they wanna go explore.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.020]   So it is doable.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.420]   And then you save money doing that too.
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.340]   There is kind of something for everyone.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.460]   And then you just kind of have to adjust
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.900]   based on your needs and your budget.
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.340]   - That one, we just bought a super compact light stroller
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.940]   that's like one click pop on your shoulder,
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.220]   carry kid down the stairs.
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.060]   - Perfect.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.260]   - So we are prepared for running around the city.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.700]   We don't have one of these giant American bus strollers
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.900]   with us for this trip.
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.460]   Is there a best time?
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.940]   And by all means, if I tell you I'm staying somewhere
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.260]   and you're like, that's the worst place to stay
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.820]   or that's the worst time of year to go,
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.900]   don't feel bad about offending me.
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.340]   Like this is for everyone else.
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.300]   But when would you say someone should plan their trip?
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.660]   - A lot of it will depend on what your budget is.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.260]   And again, not to be like,
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.100]   that every time of year is great to go.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.220]   But actually the beauty of London is that
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.460]   there's always gonna be a pro of a time
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.460]   that you're gonna visit and there's gonna be a con.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.700]   So for example, you guys are coming very soon.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.060]   So that will be middle to end of December.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.700]   The pro is it's so festive here.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.540]   It is incredibly beautiful.
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.660]   There's so many fun Christmasy things to do
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.700]   if that's what you're into.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.300]   There's also like loads of ice skating rinks
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.500]   and there's great shopping.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.380]   The downside of that is that it is cold, of course,
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.460]   and also it is very crowded.
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.700]   So like what you guys probably are gonna wanna do
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.100]   is if you wanna do some of the major things
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.860]   like the free museums, like the Natural History Museum,
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.620]   for sure you'll wanna avoid weekends
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.940]   because it is right now just like absolutely rammed
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.860]   with people who come from outside of London,
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.220]   take the train in and take the kids to go do everything.
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.540]   So every time of year has a pro and con.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.980]   If you come in January, it's really, really cold,
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.780]   but it's also the quietest time and also the cheapest time.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.140]   If you come in the summer,
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.140]   you're hopefully, fingers crossed,
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.660]   gonna get the best weather.
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.260]   You're also gonna get the most sunlight
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.060]   'cause it stays light till almost 10 o'clock,
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:41.900]   which is really cool.
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.340]   But also the prices are highest
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.740]   because it's peak travel season.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.620]   And again, you're gonna see those crowds.
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.860]   And if you get a heat wave,
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.140]   we don't deal with heat waves very well here.
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.940]   A lot of places do not have air cons.
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.980]   So if that's something that you're considering
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.580]   that would be really tricky for you,
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.020]   then that's probably not gonna be a good time
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:57.860]   for you to come.
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.180]   And then shoulder seasons are always great
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.380]   'cause they've got the mix of the peak and the downtime.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.900]   - So if you want a deal, avoid the summer.
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.620]   I would say avoid Christmas, New Year's holidays,
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.100]   but we're going like the two weeks before that.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.860]   And we got amazing deals
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.220]   because I think everyone's traveling in the States
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.060]   for Thanksgiving.
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.980]   Everyone's traveling around Christmas, New Year's.
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.220]   No one's really traveling the first few weeks of December.
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.300]   So I think it's a great deal time.
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.820]   We'll see how we fare on the weekends.
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.020]   Maybe those are our park days
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.460]   to just kind of let the kids run wild.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.300]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.260]   - I have a friend who always was like,
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.420]   "You know what, you can go to any city
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.580]   "for any amount of time."
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.300]   Is it crazy if you live in New York
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.500]   and it's seven hours to go for the weekend?
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.540]   Is it crazy to go for a week, two weeks?
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.220]   At what point in time do you say,
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.980]   maybe if you're going that long,
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.020]   check out some other place for a few days?
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.020]   - Yeah, so you can do a weekend.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.780]   So when I first moved over here
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.660]   and I was working at a travel company,
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.500]   this travel company was selling to the British crowd
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.380]   these three-day trips to New York.
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.020]   And I was like, "That is absurd.
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.220]   "Who would fly all the way to New York for three days?"
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.180]   But it is doable.
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.100]   It's actually not that far if you really think about it,
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.020]   but it is quite a journey.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.780]   So I usually say at least a week
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.340]   is a really good amount of time
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:11.340]   because you can really dig into some of the areas,
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.060]   not just like the main tourist attractions,
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.860]   but you can also give yourself time
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.660]   and you don't have to feel like you're rushing around
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.500]   because you have three days to see
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.900]   whether it's all the main tourist attractions
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.980]   or you wanna see Shoreditch and you wanna do Notting Hill,
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.140]   but those are really far apart,
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.500]   so you're probably not gonna do those in the same day.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.820]   It just gives you some time to take your time
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.180]   and also be a little bit more spontaneous.
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.820]   For Love in London, we sell a three-day itinerary.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.020]   That's our most popular thing.
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.540]   And we also have a six-day one,
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.660]   which has actually been really popular as well
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.260]   because most of my audience
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.820]   are people who are coming from the US,
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.180]   so they are coming for usually more than three days.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.820]   But a week is a great amount of time.
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.460]   And I usually say if you wanna do day trips,
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.900]   I usually recommend not doing them
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.660]   if you have less than a week
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.660]   because there's just so much you can do in London.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.380]   And again, if you're still feeling a bit jet-lagged
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.860]   and you've come to London,
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.100]   you've been running, running, running
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.020]   for the first few days,
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.740]   and then you have to hop on a train one day
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.780]   and head out to Bath or Oxford or wherever you wanna go,
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.300]   that's great, but also,
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.300]   you might wanna just slow it down a little bit,
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.140]   in my opinion.
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.580]   I'm always trying to get people to just be like,
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.660]   okay, there's a lot to do and you can't do it all,
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.460]   so let's try to slow it down and leave some room
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.620]   for if you see a shop that you wanna go into
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.580]   and spend an hour in, or you run past a cafe
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.180]   and you're like, let's just sit for an hour
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.340]   and have a nice coffee and just relax,
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.180]   then you can do that.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.900]   - So we're going for, I think, six days.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.140]   We're not going anywhere else.
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.260]   Our style of travel, though, to be clear,
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.180]   we haven't actually done this with kids,
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.900]   is much more like I wanna get the experience
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.020]   of being in London, living in London.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.820]   So if we miss some of the tourist destinations,
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.100]   that's fine.
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.740]   London is so central to so many European trips
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.700]   that I'm sure we'll be back in the future.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.740]   So I think we're trying to go on the kind of trip
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.140]   you describe, and I went through one of those itineraries
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.260]   you made and I was like, this is exactly what I want.
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.900]   I would say maybe, I was like, we have two kids,
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.220]   it's probably a little overkill for a two-kid trip,
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.140]   but some of those things we'll just skip.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.180]   What about food?
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.980]   You said there's lots of cuisines throughout the world,
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.100]   but would you say London's like a foodie town for drinks?
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.660]   There's pubs, so is it more of a beer crowd?
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.300]   California seems like it's more wine
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.900]   and now cocktails in the city.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.100]   - Yeah, so everything, all of the above.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.580]   So London's amazing.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.260]   You can try any cuisine here from all over the world.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.420]   Something I do see that's a little bit of a mistake
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.980]   from tourists sometimes is that you come to London
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.580]   and you only just wanna have British food,
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.500]   which I'm not saying don't have British food.
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.700]   Try fish and chips, bangers and mash, the pie,
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.380]   like totally do that if that's what you wanna do.
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.660]   But there's also so many different cuisines,
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.420]   especially if you don't think you're ever gonna get
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.900]   to Malaysia, why don't you try like Malaysian food
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.700]   or Sri Lankan food and you can really expand your palate
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.740]   and try cuisines that you might not ever get to try again
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.500]   if you're never gonna go to like a major metropolitan city.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.580]   We have a huge foodie scene here, same with drinks.
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.620]   So pubs are huge, but also cocktail bars,
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.500]   we've got great wine bars,
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.020]   there's drinking for the lower end of the budget
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.460]   and just like rowdy, like more fun, younger crowds.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.820]   Then there's also really fancy speakeasies
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.260]   and really like exclusive cocktail bars.
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.460]   Anything you can want, we've got it here.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.140]   This is what's so cool about London is that anything
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.820]   that you want, you're gonna be able to find it.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.940]   You just kinda have to like do a little sifting.
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.620]   - So we're gonna get into a lot of these things
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.140]   and I want some real recommendations,
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.700]   but you said a mistake is eating just British food.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.020]   I feel like British food has a pretty terrible reputation.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.620]   So I'm like, man, if that's what you're coming to London
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.220]   for, you're probably doing it wrong.
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.980]   What other mistakes are people making
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:47.820]   when they're coming to London?
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.980]   - Well, I am gonna caveat that, what you just said actually.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.700]   So British food has gotten much better.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.340]   So you can do really well.
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.740]   And if you do wanna have British food,
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.500]   I always say the best place is at pubs
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.700]   because most pubs will have restaurant sections
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.060]   and they'll have like classic pub menus
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.540]   or they'll be more of like a gastropub
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.500]   and do a modern take on similar British dishes.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.380]   So it is good, but yeah,
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.860]   I just wanted to throw that in there,
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.620]   but it's definitely the type of food
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.620]   that you'll get sick of after like eating it
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.420]   three times in a row, for sure, yeah.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:17.980]   - I watched a few of your videos
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.820]   and one of them was like,
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.260]   if it says it's like truly authentic pub,
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.100]   just like run away.
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.140]   - Yeah, exactly, it's one of those things
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.860]   like if you have to say it, you probably aren't.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.260]   So something that I have been seeing with tourists recently
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.500]   is there's a lot of content around
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.660]   when you use public transportation here
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.380]   that you have to get an Oyster card.
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.780]   An Oyster card is basically something that you can buy
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.820]   once you get here, where you add your money to it
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.180]   and you use it to tap in and out for the underground system
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.380]   or to use the buses.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.860]   But then you have to keep tapping it up.
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.380]   You also have to pay seven pounds for each of the cards
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.860]   and it's non-refundable.
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.940]   So instead, I'm just trying to tell people,
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.820]   you can actually use Apple Pay or Google Pay
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.620]   and you don't have to worry about doing the top up.
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.700]   And also if you have any credit or debit cards
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.620]   that are contactless, you can use those too.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.580]   And it's much easier and quicker
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.340]   and you don't have to wait in the queue
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.940]   to top it up at the station
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.180]   every time you run out of credit.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.860]   So that's something I see quite a lot.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.180]   I also see a lot of people who think
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:20.940]   that you have to spend a ton of money on their hotel
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.540]   to make sure that they're in a safe area
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.940]   or they're just at a safe property
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.220]   and they end up sticking to
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.700]   some of the big US corporate brands, which is fine.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.540]   That's fine.
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.460]   And I know everyone's got points and stuff.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.820]   So a lot of people are trying to stick to the Marriotts
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.820]   and this and that, blah, blah, blah.
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:36.780]   That's completely fine.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:41.780]   But we have so many amazing, safe, boutique hotel properties
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.740]   that are like so beautiful and interesting
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.820]   and they're small and they're in gray areas too,
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.060]   even if they're not in very central London.
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.340]   So I would say don't ever discount something
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.100]   that looks like it's a good deal.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.420]   If it just doesn't seem like it's a name
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.620]   that's recognizable to you,
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.460]   or it's in an area that you don't necessarily recognize
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.740]   as like Covent Garden or Soho right in the center of London.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.500]   You could end up in a really amazing hotel
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.620]   and also in a cool area.
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.780]   - Is there like a good rating site in the UK
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.260]   that's like, oh, I'm looking at this hotel, is it good?
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.900]   Like I don't personally put a lot of faith in TripAdvisor.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.540]   So I'm curious whether it's restaurants or hotels,
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.580]   is there a thing?
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.420]   - So for hotels, I personally use booking.com.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.340]   I find that the ratings generally are on point.
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.500]   And then obviously you can just book right to booking.com.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.380]   So it's really easy.
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.980]   I don't really use TripAdvisor for anything actually anymore.
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.180]   And then in terms of food,
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.020]   so we don't have like a Yelp here
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:40.020]   and TripAdvisor is generally tourists.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.460]   So I would say if you're looking
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.860]   for like what locals think about food
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.060]   or a bar or something like that,
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.140]   probably like Google reviews, which are always,
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.060]   you never really know,
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.940]   but I think that's where like most Londoners would go
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.580]   if they're looking for reviews in a style
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.740]   that's a site like that with like actual reviews from people.
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.460]   Otherwise we have websites like The Infatuation
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.860]   is really big here, Time Out, Love and London.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:06.820]   I don't know if you heard of it,
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.980]   but we talk about food and drink
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.140]   and all the things of course.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.340]   - You briefly said something about safety.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.020]   Is there dangerous parts of London?
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.500]   Should people be concerned at all?
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.220]   I had this one realization
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.620]   where I was reading this Lonely Planet book
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.740]   for New York for fun.
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.700]   I think someone we knew was traveling around the States
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.260]   and it was like, New York, make sure you get a money belt
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.900]   and you put all of your money in your money belt
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:28.740]   and tuck it in your pants.
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.740]   And I was like, I've been to New York dozens of times.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.700]   It's never crossed my mind.
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.300]   I've lived there, never been a thing.
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.420]   Is everyone just always kind of scaring people?
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.420]   So what's the low down there?
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.740]   Are there places to avoid?
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.420]   Are there times a day to avoid?
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.660]   Is the tube rampant with pickpockets?
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.380]   - So there are areas in London
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.140]   that are relatively speaking not safe,
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.220]   but they're never where tourists are gonna end up.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.140]   So I always say like, don't worry about the area.
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.300]   It's never a place that you would ever go.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.020]   So areas are completely fine.
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.060]   In terms of pickpockets and things like that,
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.900]   just like you would in any other city,
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.540]   just keep yourself close to you.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.180]   Don't have your phone waving around.
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.620]   We do have a little bit of a problem
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.740]   at the moment of mopeds going by
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.580]   and grabbing phones out of hands.
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.820]   So that's really the main thing.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.140]   But otherwise, just the same rules
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.020]   you would apply to any major city.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.580]   Don't have your pockets open.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.660]   Don't have anything in the back pocket
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.500]   where people can easily take it from you.
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.900]   Keep everything zipped up, everything close to you.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.220]   Don't have any valuables out in plain sight.
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.860]   But millions of people run around the city every day
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.460]   and have absolutely no problems.
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.820]   So it's really nothing to be concerned about.
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.460]   And I think in terms of safety at night,
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:40.500]   generally the only thing I would say is that women on their own--
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.340]   so I usually, past 11 o'clock, will get an Uber to get home.
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.700]   But if I was with somebody else, then we're
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.500]   fine to be on public transport and to walk on our own.
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.860]   People can interpret how they want to.
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.700]   So I want to get a lay of the land.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.260]   And we could spend so long talking about here's
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.500]   this neighbor, that neighbor.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.980]   But is there generally a way you break up the city
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.660]   and kind of group it into a few major areas?
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.060]   Yeah, so basically the most popular area
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.060]   that tourists a lot of times only stay in
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.020]   is what's called central London.
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.780]   So this is like the really famous areas
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.740]   like Soho, Covent Garden, Marlebone, the South Bank,
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.140]   Westminster, which is where Buckingham Palace, Houses
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.980]   of Parliament, all those places are.
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.300]   And it includes a few other areas.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.500]   That's where the majority of the tourist attractions are.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.180]   And it is the dead center of London.
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.460]   So that's where even Londoners will go there
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.100]   if we're meeting a friend for dinner.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.940]   And we both live on other parts of the city.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.500]   So that's where a lot of tourists
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.700]   end up doing a lot of stuff.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.460]   There's lots of good restaurants around there, and bars,
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.020]   and things like that.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.140]   You just have to know where you're going.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.540]   So there's also some really not so good stuff there.
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.660]   It's like very tourist trappy and kind of gross.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.380]   It's those like authentic pub kind of places
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.500]   that you'll find there.
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.580]   Basically, the city's broken up into four major areas.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.380]   Simply North London, South London, East London,
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.500]   and West London.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.660]   And in each of those areas, there's a few main areas
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.980]   that I would say that tourists are more likely to go to,
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.500]   because there's things to do.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.220]   And it's not only just neighborhood-y.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.420]   There's good bars, good restaurants, parks, activities,
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.540]   things like that.
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.620]   Personally, for me, I live in East London.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.300]   That's my favorite part of the city.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.060]   There's just lots of stuff to do around here.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.180]   And it's fun and beautiful.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.660]   But then West London has Notting Hill
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.300]   and lots of great museums and really interesting things
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.500]   to do there.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.300]   And North and South also have their great things, too.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.020]   As Londoners, we have this really big divide
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.460]   of we self-identify if we're East or West London.
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.740]   And we think the other side is terrible.
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.240]   We don't know why people live there.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.460]   And then the same with North of the river, which
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.240]   is the River Thames, or South of the river.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.940]   And there's this constant battle of,
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.660]   why would you live on the other side?
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.700]   It's so boring there.
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.140]   And it's just always been like that.
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.340]   Let's highlight a couple neighborhoods
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.020]   where you're like, these are just really cool spots.
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.480]   Whether you stay there, you spend an afternoon or a morning
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.140]   there, what would you put on your list
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.740]   of three or four awesome neighborhoods in London?
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.860]   OK, so--
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.940]   Not all in East London.
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.820]   I know you think it's the coolest place ever.
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.620]   OK, fine, fine.
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.200]   So I've said Notting Hill a lot.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.940]   I think that's a really famous one.
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.820]   So I might not spend too much time on that.
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.340]   But Notting Hill is a really beautiful area.
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.540]   And it's one of the few areas of London
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.260]   where, even though it's quite popular with tourists,
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.380]   it still has a really interesting local vibe where
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.460]   neighbors actually say hello to each other,
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.340]   people pass by each other on the streets.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.380]   It's a really lovely community area.
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.140]   And that's why the pub scene around there is so great.
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.420]   And that's why I always recommend people to go
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.820]   do pub hopping around there for a nice relaxed afternoon.
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.980]   It's not like a crazy, let's get drunk pub kind of area.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.900]   But if we skip on past Notting Hill, in North London,
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.660]   there's an area called Hampstead.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.940]   The main thing there is this park called Hampstead Heath.
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.740]   And it's this beautiful big park that has viewpoints.
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.600]   There's swimming ponds that people go to in the summer.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.780]   There's Kenwood House.
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.580]   Have you ever seen the movie Notting Hill, actually, Chris?
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.780]   I'm not sure if I have.
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:08.620]   OK, OK.
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.180]   When you say it, I'm like, of course it's a movie.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:11.900]   I remember it.
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.140]   But now I'm like, have I?
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.420]   I don't know.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.260]   That's OK.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.620]   Well, if you do watch it-- and I'm
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.960]   sure there will be people listening that have seen it--
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.100]   Kenwood House is featured in the movie towards the end
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.380]   when she's filming this like Victorian film.
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.900]   And Hugh Grant's listening to her speak.
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.140]   And it's a whole thing.
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.740]   You'll have to watch it at some point.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.700]   So the house that's featured in that is in Hampstead Heath.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.620]   So people go to Hampstead Heath to see
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.580]   this beautiful Victorian house, which actually is also
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.180]   a little museum that has art and other things
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.980]   that you can see in there.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.180]   So that's a really good jumping off point.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.700]   Really great to take kids there, because they can run around,
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.740]   see the wildlife.
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.220]   They can see people swimming.
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.140]   They can go swimming.
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.700]   Not right now, but a little too cold.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.460]   Probably not on this trip.
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.220]   Yeah, not this trip.
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:54.800]   Not this trip.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.580]   And then you can go into Hampstead Village, which
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.540]   has really great cafes, bars, restaurants.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.100]   And it's super family friendly.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.180]   It's also this really just beautiful area
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.360]   with like multi-million pound houses.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.860]   A lot of celebrities live around here.
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.780]   And there's a lot of historical value.
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.940]   So that's Hampstead.
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.060]   Yeah, and then, I mean, it's hard to pick,
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.460]   because there's so many.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.340]   And I love to kind of talk a little bit more about the areas
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.980]   that people don't go to as much.
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.360]   Like, if we go to South London, there's
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.140]   an area that's called Brixton.
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.860]   Brixton is super diverse, has really great markets
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.660]   that have been around for ages.
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:34.980]   And they have vendors selling all different types of wares,
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.980]   as well as there's little wine bars.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.340]   There's little shops there.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.700]   So Brixton is just a really cool, interesting area
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.540]   with lots of things to do down there.
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.280]   If you're going to stay central, though,
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.060]   there's an area that I really like going to
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.460]   that's called Seven Dials.
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.180]   So it's really close to Covent Garden,
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:55.700]   which is one of the most famous areas in Central to go.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.260]   But Seven Dials is basically seven streets
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.580]   that converge onto each other.
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.340]   And there's a sundial in the middle of it.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.980]   That's obviously where the name comes from.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.460]   And down these streets, there's some not independent places,
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.340]   but there's also lots of great independent cafes
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.260]   and restaurants.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.700]   There's a couple of pubs in the area.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.400]   And there's a really great indoor food market
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.940]   called Seven Dials Food Market, which I highly recommend.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.300]   And then there's also this hidden little courtyard
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.380]   that's called Neil's Yard, which you can go into.
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.620]   It's the home of Neil's Yard Remedies, which
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.260]   is quite a famous skin care brand.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.060]   And in there, you'll find this fantastic wine bar
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:39.220]   called CVS, and also one of my favorite restaurants
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.860]   in London called The Barbary.
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.740]   And now they have a new place next door called
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.980]   The Barbary Next Door.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.760]   And they do food that's inspired by the Barbary Coast.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.360]   And it's so good, really, really good.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.360]   It's one of those ways I'm like, I don't really
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.920]   love telling people about this, but I don't want to gatekeep.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.320]   So yeah, really yummy food there.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.880]   But it's a really cute, colorful little courtyard.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.960]   And so it looks really nice in photos as well.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.200]   And you can sit there, have a glass of wine, have some food,
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:07.980]   have a coffee.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:08.560]   It's great.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.200]   And then I am going to circle over to East London.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.080]   It is my favorite.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.560]   There's an area called Shortage.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.960]   This is probably the most popular area of East London.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.840]   And it is very eclectic.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.920]   It is the area that's the most popular for street art.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.220]   So if you are really interested in seeing street art,
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.400]   this is where you're going to do it.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.960]   You can either walk around on your own and easily find it,
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.680]   or there's loads of really affordable or free street art
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.040]   tours that you can do.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:39.100]   This is also where a lot of creative agencies are based,
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.800]   a lot of artistic agencies.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.000]   So a lot of the people that are in this area,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.600]   even during the week, are very creative.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.120]   So you always kind of feel that vibe while you're there.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.240]   And of course, you're going to have good cafes,
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.480]   good coffee, fantastic restaurants.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.680]   I come to this area a lot to eat.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.600]   One of the restaurants that I love is called Bao.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.400]   And they do Taiwanese bao buns.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.760]   And in Shortage, they have a noodle shop,
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.440]   which is really good.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.680]   So highly recommend going there.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.280]   And for cafes, Attendant Cafe is really good.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.820]   They do really nice coffee.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:16.960]   And probably the most popular cafe around this area
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.600]   at the moment is a place called Jolene.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.120]   And there is basically always a line outside the door,
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.400]   especially on the weekends.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.440]   But the coffee here is just fantastic.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.320]   And they do great pastries as well.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.240]   So if you want coffee, that's a good spot to go.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.920]   So I am quite comfortable right now,
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.540]   which is actually true almost every day.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.880]   And that's thanks to Viore.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.760]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.960]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.820]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.200]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.960]   And it's so freaking comfortable,
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.760]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.960]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.840]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.080]   unless you're wearing Viore,
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.840]   in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.640]   And it's not just for men.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.480]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.120]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.560]   I think I have three pairs,
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.640]   and they are probably the most comfortable pants
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.720]   I've ever owned.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.600]   Their products can be used for just about any activity,
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.040]   whether it's running, training, or yoga.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.520]   They're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.440]   or their MetaPants can even work for a night out.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.520]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.000]   And for all the Hacks listeners,

[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.200]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.120]   If you're still working to get in
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.320]   all your 2022 tax deductions before the 31st,
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.160]   here are a few tips from Daffy,
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.200]   who sponsored this episode to help you put money aside
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.620]   for charity and save on your 2022 taxes.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.240]   One, if you're gonna owe taxes in 2022,
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.200]   look to charitable giving now.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.680]   The charitable donation deduction
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.320]   is one of the most generous.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.960]   You can deduct up to 60% of your adjusted gross income.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.140]   Two, if you can, donate appreciated stock,
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.680]   ETFs, or crypto instead of cash.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.800]   You not only get the charitable donation deduction
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.280]   for the full fair market value of assets held over one year,
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.400]   but you will never owe capital gains tax
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.640]   on those investments.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.600]   Three, use a donor advised fund or DAF.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.080]   I personally use DAFy and it's amazing.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.560]   A DAF is a tax advantaged account that lets you donate now
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.160]   and qualify for the tax deduction this year,
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.000]   but gives you time and flexibility
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.480]   in distributing the money to charities who need it.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.360]   Also remember, you don't have to own individual stocks
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.400]   to take advantage of these tax savings.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.320]   You can contribute ETF shares to a DAF now,
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.880]   avoid capital gains tax,
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.120]   and use cash to ensure your portfolio stays balanced.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.240]   To make all your tax deductible donations
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.480]   before year end in one place,
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.640]   go to allthehacks.com/dafy.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.800]   Plus, for a limited time, if you visit that link,
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.000]   you can get a free $25 to give
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.680]   to the charity of your choice.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.680]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/DAFFY.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.960]   I kinda got a little bit of lay of the land.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.940]   Obviously, I'm gonna have to walk around.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.520]   You talked earlier about how you have
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.760]   these awesome itineraries.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.200]   So I've been going through the three-day
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.640]   because I was like, well, I don't wanna plan too much.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.200]   So let's take the three-day, spread it out over six-day.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.320]   What do you think things people should be
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.560]   really trying to do on their trip?
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.120]   I'm sure someone could find a list,
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.600]   best attractions in London.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.380]   We don't need to go through everything,
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.000]   but what are the highlights of an itinerary?
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.880]   - Of course, everybody wants to go see
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.400]   the House of Parliament and Big Ben and Westminster Bridge.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.180]   So I think do whatever the sites
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.800]   that you're really interested in,
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.240]   make sure you do them because I get it.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.280]   You're in London and you've seen these things
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.660]   on TV and in movies for years.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.240]   So make sure you do that.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.880]   For me, I'm always trying to think of an interesting way
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.720]   to see something.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.520]   So I think a good example is,
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.080]   everyone knows the Tower of London.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.200]   So the Tower of London, it's been around
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.640]   for like a thousand years and it's still in this place.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.140]   And you can go and have tours there.
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.800]   They're very family-friendly,
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.120]   but you can also do something that's quite interesting,
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.120]   which is called the Ceremony of the Keys.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.400]   And what this is, it's a tradition
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.000]   that's been happening for 700 years.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.420]   And they've done it every single day for 700 years,
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.880]   except I think there's one day during one of the wars
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.480]   that they had to stop doing it.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.400]   You got tickets for it and you basically watch
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.880]   this tradition of where they exchange the keys
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.320]   when they're kind of like closing up the tower at night.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.440]   And it's never been recorded.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.640]   You're not allowed to film it.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.080]   You're not allowed to take pictures.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.640]   And I think it's a really interesting, different way
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.920]   to experience this like really popular tourist attractions.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.560]   And it's very hard to get tickets,
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.000]   but it's definitely doable.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.560]   And the tickets are only five pounds,
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.280]   whereas it's usually I think about 25 pounds
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.480]   for adults to get in at normal times of the day.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.140]   So I think that's really cool.
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.320]   In terms of viewpoint, so a lot of people
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.840]   like to do the London Eye, which that's cool.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.400]   The first time I ever came to London,
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.480]   I did the London Eye as well.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.020]   I thought it was great.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.360]   It is a bit of a steep price for the tickets.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.320]   So if you still wanna do some kind of viewpoint,
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.720]   but maybe you don't need to do the London Eye,
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.120]   you could go to this place called the Sky Garden,
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.720]   which is completely free to visit.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.400]   And it's actually higher up than the London Eye.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.560]   It's basically this garden in the sky.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.480]   You take a lift all the way up to the top of the building.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.380]   That's called the walkie talkie building
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.000]   'cause it looks like a walkie talkie.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.880]   And there's all this plant life that you walk around,
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.920]   but there's also these amazing views
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.840]   over the London skyline.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.440]   It's pretty cool and a lot cheaper, obviously.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.680]   - I know you're like the spokesperson
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.280]   for London on YouTube in my mind,
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.440]   but don't be afraid to be like, dude, it's just not worth it.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.520]   Don't waste your time there.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:05.040]   I know you've said that about Leicester Square, but.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.760]   - Yeah, Leicester Square is for sure the number one thing
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.360]   that I'm like, avoid it at all costs.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.080]   Like I even will walk around it
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.000]   if I'm just navigating to get somewhere else in the city.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.800]   Basically, Leicester Square is this part of central London
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.560]   where it's just lined with like McDonald's, Burger King.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.360]   There's a couple of casinos.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.920]   There's a couple of movie theaters.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:27.860]   There's the M&M store,
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.400]   which I have so much disdain for the M&M store.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.400]   I just don't understand.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.200]   And there's always such a line to get into it.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.240]   The Lego store.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.360]   For some reason, there's so much stuff out there
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.720]   saying to go see Leicester Square.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.000]   I'm like, there's nothing here.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.260]   It's not upkept very well.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.880]   And so I always say to avoid that.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.560]   Instead, you could actually go just one block over
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.640]   and you're in Chinatown, which is amazing.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.920]   We have a small Chinatown in London, but really good food.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.640]   There's some hidden bars there
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.960]   and just a really interesting place to walk around.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.060]   So I'm always like, skip Leicester Square.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.240]   Instead, go to Chinatown.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.960]   It's literally one block over.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.280]   - Do you have a favorite hidden bar?
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.480]   - So in Chinatown, there's one that's called Opium
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:10.120]   and it's a green door that is unmarked
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.920]   and you go up the stairs and there's three different rooms
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.560]   and the cocktails are really good.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.680]   They're like super unique and different
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.720]   and they're all like Oriental themed.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.480]   So super interesting and they serve food there as well.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.440]   But the cocktails, go for the cocktails.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.580]   Hard to pick a favorite hidden bar,
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.800]   but I actually went to a really good one last night
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.960]   called Nightjar.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.720]   There's two different locations and it's Prohibition themed.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.840]   So you go like down the stairs,
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.200]   the menu is like themed with different parts
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.640]   of the Prohibition and the war
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.280]   and the servers are dressed up like they're old timey
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.600]   and the service is amazing and the cocktails are really cool.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.660]   - And are these the kind of places
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.600]   where you need to make a reservation?
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.480]   How does that typically work?
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.240]   - Yes, especially recently London,
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.400]   you have to make reservations to get into places,
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.680]   especially the ones that are quite popular,
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.400]   even if they are kind of under the radar,
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.680]   people still find out about them
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.840]   'cause Londoners love under the radar stuff.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.000]   Anytime you can make a reservation,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.960]   I highly, highly recommend it
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.640]   'cause also a lot of places in London are just very small.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.520]   So they have very little covers.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.520]   So if 10 people show up,
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.080]   that might cover the whole restaurant.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.200]   So anytime you can make a reservation for sure
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.320]   or go very early or very late and you might be okay.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.140]   - It's funny, I'm like such an optimizer
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:24.980]   and normally I'm like,
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.760]   okay, I'm gonna research all this stuff.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.320]   And then I was like looking through your three day itinerary
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.600]   I was like, well, this is pretty good.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.440]   You just put it together.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.520]   So for me, I was like,
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.040]   normally I would wanna go through all this
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.440]   and I was like, why don't we just use this?
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.980]   Like, why don't we just, this is our new playbook
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.200]   and save us a lot of time.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.680]   So I appreciate that.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.520]   Any other must see things that people need to do
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.360]   when they're here for a short trip?
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:46.960]   I wanna see the city as it is normally seen
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.960]   by people who live here.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:51.640]   And I imagine you don't spend every weekend at the Tate.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.040]   - No, exactly.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.960]   And the thing is too, like personally my mindset
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:00.320]   for what I do is that there's not really any must sees
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.000]   because it completely depends on what you're interested in.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.560]   So like some people might say,
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.240]   you have to go to the National Portrait Gallery,
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.520]   but if you're not into portrait art,
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.520]   even though it's free to go into,
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.920]   don't waste your time there.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.680]   Find art that you like or skip art altogether.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.360]   The Tate Modern's not gonna be interesting to you
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.800]   if you're not interested in modern art.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.240]   So I'm trying to give people like the permission.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.040]   Don't feel like you have to do something
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.000]   because someone has said like, you have to do the London Eye.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.840]   You don't have to.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.840]   There's so many things you can do.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.080]   Just do whatever's gonna work for you and also your budget
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.520]   because some of this stuff's really pricey.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.360]   So if you're gonna take the four of you on the London Eye,
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.240]   that's gonna cost you like a hundred pounds,
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.240]   then is that really gonna feel worth it
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.440]   if you weren't really that interested?
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.080]   - Are there deals for some of these things
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.760]   like that I should know about going in,
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.720]   like book it in advance or buy it from this guy
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.640]   who works down this alley in the street?
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.680]   - Oh yeah, definitely.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.080]   If you wanna do like the main attractions,
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.320]   I always tell people to look into the London Pass,
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:59.440]   which is, it's got like 150 of the biggest attractions
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:04.080]   on this pass and you get a two-day pass, a three-day pass,
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.120]   a six-day pass, whatever you choose.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.600]   And the tickets are included in the price that you pay.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.480]   And if it works with what you wanna see,
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.360]   you can save a lot of money with that.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.200]   You just have to plan and do some math
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.360]   to make sure that it all adds up.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.040]   Because if you're mostly wanting to see stuff
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.320]   that has low ticket prices,
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.680]   then it's probably not gonna be worth it.
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.000]   But if you're going to the big things
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.680]   with big ticket prices, it does end up saving,
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.360]   especially if you've got four of you, five of you,
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.160]   'cause they have kids passes as well.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.000]   It actually can end up saving you like hundreds of dollars.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.240]   It's actually kind of crazy.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.880]   So the London Pass, we do have something on our website
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.840]   where it helps people understand
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.080]   if it's gonna work for them or not before they buy it.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.640]   So if you just Google London Pass on our site,
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.480]   that's helpful.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.920]   - I'll link to that page on the show notes.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.760]   - Perfect.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.120]   In the line of the Sunday roast that we were talking about,
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.240]   another British tradition here is called afternoon tea.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.680]   And I personally love afternoon tea.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.760]   It's mostly hotels that will put on afternoon tea.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.600]   Some restaurants do it as well.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.080]   Around like one o'clock, two o'clock,
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.080]   you'll go to this hotel that you've booked
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.400]   and they bring out your selection of tea.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.560]   You get to choose if you want tea or coffee.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.880]   If you go really high end,
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.040]   they'll have like extra specialty
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:19.120]   that's been flown in from Sri Lanka or India or wherever.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.200]   It's like really a beautiful experience.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.760]   And then you get a bunch of different types of treats.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.440]   So we'll start with little finger sandwiches
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.880]   of various variety of different kinds.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.360]   Then you'll also get scones, which, oh, I love scones.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.380]   Scones kind of resemble crumpets,
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.240]   but they're a lot nicer than crumpets in my opinion.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.960]   And you eat those with jam and cream.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:46.960]   And then the final tier is the sweet treats.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.200]   So the really nice places, this is where like they shine.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.560]   They do these little pieces of artwork
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:57.520]   that you eat for your lunch/breakfast,
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.960]   whatever time you ended up going.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.440]   And it's a really lovely experience.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.640]   A lot of people in London will do it
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.660]   as like a special occasion for someone's birthday
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.720]   or for bridal showers and things like that.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.880]   It's very British and it's lovely.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.840]   It's really lovely.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.760]   One of the places that I always recommend
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.200]   if you want like a very classic,
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.280]   traditional afternoon tea experience is Fortnum & Mason,
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.240]   which is a department store.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.280]   And they've got a beautiful tea room,
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.280]   which I think the queen actually opened it up
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.120]   if I remember correctly.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.860]   Yeah, it's very classic.
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.880]   They've got like the classical music playing.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.320]   Somebody's playing piano.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.640]   You can get champagne if you want champagne.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.920]   So I recommend either there
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   or if you want something really special with amazing views,
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.860]   there is the Shard,
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.400]   which is the tallest building in Western Europe.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.840]   And there's the Shangri-La Hotel, which is in the Shard.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.480]   And their restaurant Ting does a sky-high afternoon tea,
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.560]   which they like pull out all the stops.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.680]   It's an amazing experience.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.600]   - This is also something that as we did some research,
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.180]   it's like not everywhere,
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.080]   but many places are pretty kid-friendly
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.160]   and even sometimes like kid-themed.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.720]   So it looked pretty cool
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.360]   as something we could do with the kids.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.360]   - Also, if you want another recommendation
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.560]   for a kid-friendly tea at the One Aldwych Hotel,
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.480]   they do a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory themed tea,
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.280]   which is really great for the adults as well,
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.720]   but the kids love it too.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.960]   So it's like really cute.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.400]   - So I have a random question,
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.680]   but very specific to tea.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.680]   So we looked at this one.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.080]   It seems like make reservations for most of these places,
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.360]   but I was looking at the menu
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.680]   and I guess either it's an entire meal.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.800]   It looks like it's enough food
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.920]   that like you're skipping lunch that day.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.240]   Or I was like, well, our daughter usually naps at like one.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.380]   What if we went at three o'clock?
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.200]   I don't want to ruin dinner.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.960]   Would it be poor form to go
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.280]   and just get like one or two for four people?
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.960]   Or do you need to order one for every person?
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.480]   - It's a bit different with kids.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.960]   If you've got like really little ones,
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.920]   then you don't have to order ones for them, obviously,
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.800]   if they're not going to eat it,
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.880]   but you usually do order one for each person.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.840]   - Okay. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.160]   - I was looking for like a little deal.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.200]   I was like, if we just want a little snack here and there.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.040]   - I know.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.020]   Well, the kids' ones are cheaper.
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.560]   So they're like significantly cheaper.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.400]   So that's good.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.000]   But actually a lot of people ask me that.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.440]   So that's a good question.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.320]   - Whenever my wife and I do like a tasting menu,
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.440]   we're like, can we just do wine for one of us?
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.280]   Because we don't need six glasses of wine.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.400]   So we'll just do the tasty menu with wine
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.640]   and one person doesn't do the wine,
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.480]   but then we just share it.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.960]   So little things like that.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.960]   Afternoon tea, any other cool experiences?
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.320]   Even if they're small, like I'll say in New York City,
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.960]   one of my favorite things to tell people to do
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.880]   is if you're downtown,
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.760]   take the six train at the end of the line
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.300]   and just ride it South till it turns around
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.220]   and comes back North.
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.020]   And you loop through City Hall Station,
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.520]   which is a closed station.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.420]   It's like many, many years old.
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.260]   It's really cool.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.880]   It was like the shining star of the subway system,
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.720]   but it's not open.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.140]   And you can like once or twice a year get a tour there.
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.860]   But if you just ride the six train,
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.460]   it actually says, I think it's Brooklyn Bridge.
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.420]   It's like, you're on a downtown six train next stop,
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.740]   Brooklyn Bridge uptown.
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.180]   And you could like ride this cool loop.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.780]   There's always these like kind of cool, random, weird things
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:00.060]   that would never make an average tourist list.
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:01.520]   In San Francisco, there was this thing,
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.920]   for anyone who did it, you'll know exactly what I mean.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.360]   Unfortunately, it's closed, called the Jejune Institute.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.680]   And you like went to this office building
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.240]   and you just went up to the 30th floor.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.920]   You knocked on a door, the door opened,
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.400]   you went into a room and you like watched a weird video
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.480]   and there was an envelope.
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.040]   And then you would go on like a scavenger hunt.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.120]   And I'm like, I have no idea how this works.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.600]   Like you put a $20 in a slot, but there were no people.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.440]   It was the weirdest thing.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.480]   It wasn't an escape room 'cause there was no escaping,
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.120]   but it kind of had that vibe.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.760]   And it was the coolest thing ever,
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.280]   but not on any tourist guide.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.220]   So any of those kind of like cool experiences
[00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.240]   that you might do on the weekends with friends
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.840]   that would, maybe it would make one of your guides,
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.720]   but it's definitely not in the average guide.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.040]   - Okay, so I'll give you two
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.240]   'cause I'll give you a little one,
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.460]   but then let me give you a bit of a bigger one
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:44.880]   that you can spend an afternoon.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.320]   So there is this area in London called Bermondsey
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.240]   and running through Bermondsey,
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.160]   because it's very close to London Bridge Station,
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.040]   which is one of the biggest stations in London.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.080]   There are elevated railway tracks
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.080]   and then underneath the railway tracks
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.220]   are businesses that are in the arches.
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.400]   Because they're small spaces,
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.840]   they're all very small businesses that are very independent.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:11.280]   And in one specific area of Bermondsey under these arches,
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.800]   it all happens to be breweries and gin distilleries.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.900]   And so this thing has come about
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.680]   where it's like the unofficial name for it
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.880]   is called the Bermondsey Beer Mile.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.880]   And on Saturdays, these breweries open up
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.200]   and they let people come in and do tastings
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.040]   or just get a pint or try the gin.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.160]   What people do is they make a Saturday of it
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.480]   and they hop around to all the different distilleries
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.340]   and breweries and try all the different drinks.
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:41.600]   And it can get a little bit messy, obviously,
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.040]   depending on how quickly you do it.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.880]   You can also pair that with a visit to Maltby Street Market,
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.440]   which is literally right there.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.660]   And you can get food
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:53.560]   and they have really good independent food.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.900]   They have probably the most diverse food vendors
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.600]   of all the markets in London.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.080]   I love doing that Bermondsey Beer Mile.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:01.920]   It's really fun.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.040]   And I feel like it gets skipped over so much
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.440]   because there's no official website for it.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.140]   There's someone who's made an unofficial one,
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:09.360]   but it's pretty easy to find.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.200]   You just navigate to Maltby Street Market
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.320]   and then you'll see all of the breweries and distilleries.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.780]   I love recommending that.
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.920]   But I don't think that many people take me up on it, sadly.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.400]   But it's almost good though, so it's fine.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.360]   - I don't know if we'll do the full drinking mile,
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.520]   but I'm like a sucker for street food, food market,
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.360]   anything like that.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.480]   Favorite stall?
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.360]   - I mean, I had an amazing banh mi sandwich, so Vietnamese.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.760]   I don't remember the name of the stall.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.960]   They do kind of change them out sometimes too,
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.340]   which is nice 'cause then everyone can try different things.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.040]   But I think probably that banh mi
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.520]   is a favorite I've had so far.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.340]   - Okay. - It's good.
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:44.180]   - I will look for it.
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.160]   - And then just for a little fun, a smaller one too.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.560]   We were talking about Shortage before
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.920]   and I mentioned that it's like the most famous area
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.200]   in London for street art.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.160]   So if you wanna go street art spotting, you can do that.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.320]   A fun little thing you can do while you're doing that
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:00.320]   is there's a bunch of tiny 3D broccolis
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.680]   scattered around the Brick Lane area.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:07.480]   So you can go and spot all of the little broccolis.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.460]   And the broccolis were put there,
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.240]   I think it was about 15 years ago,
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.920]   by this artist, Adrian Boswell.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.320]   And he actually has a gallery there
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.040]   and like broccolis are his thing.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.360]   So you can end up spotting all the broccolis
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.600]   and then go to his gallery
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.280]   and see what the deal is in there too.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.560]   So that's kind of a fun thing.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.960]   But it's one of those things where I had never noticed that.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.120]   And then a couple of years ago,
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.720]   somebody pointed it out to me and I was like,
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:30.920]   "Oh my God, that's so cool."
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.200]   In all of my research,
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.280]   I've never heard anyone talk about that before.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.840]   - I feel like my daughter would love
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.640]   a walk around looking for broccolis.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.520]   So that's a great one.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.360]   - Perfect.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.280]   And they're like colorful.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.040]   And so yeah, they're great for kids too.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.200]   - We're talking about food a lot
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.480]   and it just happens to be noon in San Francisco.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.520]   So I'm already getting hungry.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:51.000]   But I think the reason that we travel is often for food.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.640]   So one of the challenges is it's so easy
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.480]   if you're going to Malaysia,
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.400]   I know the kind of food I wanna go get.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.240]   But when I think of London,
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.080]   it's like, gosh,
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.960]   I've been told the best Indian food in the world
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.440]   outside of India is in London.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.040]   So we're like, okay, we got a little list there.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.880]   I don't even know how to ask this question.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.240]   Like, where should we be eating?
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.160]   Like, there's just so many options.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.960]   Are there a couple cuisines or a couple restaurants?
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.840]   I'm sure you could have a list of a thousand.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.660]   I'm sure the itinerary I was looking at
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:16.460]   probably has the list of a thousand.
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:19.080]   But what are just a few restaurants that are must go to?
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.280]   They don't have to be the most popular.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.960]   They don't have to be the most expensive.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:24.040]   Ideally, they're not the ones that you have to plan
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.280]   two months in advance to get a table.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.120]   - This is a hard one
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.860]   because there's just so many good places.
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:31.720]   Also, I think what's interesting about London,
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.000]   in my personal opinion,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.200]   is that you don't have to spend a lot of money
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.400]   to have a really, really good food experience.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.620]   I actually find that the mid-range restaurants
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:43.680]   are my favorites.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.700]   We did talk about a couple of them that I love already.
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.000]   So we did the Barbary, we talked about Bao.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.600]   There's an Italian that's called Campania and Jones,
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.680]   and it's in a tiny little place off of Columbia Road,
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.240]   which, this is East London,
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.280]   and Columbia Road is quite famous
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.160]   for being this very beautiful, picturesque street
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.480]   that has all independent shops on it.
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.280]   And on Sundays, it has a world-famous flower market,
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.680]   which people love to go visit.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.600]   You can pick up flowers,
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.000]   or you can just walk around and see the chaos
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.760]   that kind of ensues with it.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.640]   It's very fun.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.120]   So just off of that is Campania and Jones,
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:20.080]   and they do regional Italian dishes
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.180]   from Campania, obviously.
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.400]   And the food here is amazing.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.420]   It can be tricky to get reservations,
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.120]   but if you can do a weekday
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.400]   and do it like five o'clock when they open,
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.560]   then, or do a later one, like 9.30, then it is doable.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.040]   If anyone does end up going there,
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.840]   there's a starter that's called Nudie,
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.080]   and it comes with sage butter.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.180]   It was like one of the best things I've ever had.
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.100]   It's so nice.
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:43.940]   It's really good.
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:45.220]   I was with friends and we were eating it,
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.300]   and we all just stopped talking,
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.400]   which is a lot for me and my friends,
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.320]   'cause we were all just like, "Oh my God, this is amazing."
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.160]   It's kind of like Italian dumplings.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.000]   So good.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.560]   So I love Indian.
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.080]   I also love Sri Lankan.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.680]   I have been to Sri Lanka before,
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.400]   and my interest just has been piqued.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.360]   And we have some really good Sri Lankan restaurants here.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.040]   One of my favorites is called Paradise,
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.800]   and it's right in Soho, so it's very central London.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.160]   It's a modern take on Sri Lankan food.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.440]   So they do really great small dishes.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.300]   You just order a bunch of them and everybody shares.
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:18.700]   They do this chickpea curry, which is so good.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.040]   And they do amazing cocktails as well.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.220]   All the good places you do have to reserve.
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.220]   That's just kind of how it is.
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.100]   But I did, the other day, go there
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.040]   and managed to, only a couple days ahead,
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:30.460]   get a 5.30 booking for four people.
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:31.860]   So it is doable.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.780]   Go on a Monday or a Tuesday if you can,
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.420]   and go early, and that works well.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.340]   And then finally, I'm gonna give one more Italian.
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:39.980]   - Give one more Indian, 'cause I just want--
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:40.820]   - One more Indian.
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:45.060]   So Dishoom is the most popular Indian place in London.
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:47.980]   It's a little bit more of a modern take on Indian.
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:50.460]   They've got four or five locations now.
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.580]   Obviously, I can't speak to how incredibly authentic it is,
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.980]   'cause I am not from India.
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:57.780]   But it's really popular because they do
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:01.100]   really, really good food at affordable prices.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:04.220]   The staff are amazing, and the decor,
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:08.260]   it's supposed to be kind of like a small restaurant
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:09.800]   that you might see in Bombay.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.500]   So the decor is really interesting.
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.940]   And kid-friendly, works for everyone.
[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:16.700]   It's one of my favorite places to go for breakfast.
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:17.540]   - Ooh.
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:18.380]   - Yeah, they do really good breakfast.
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:19.200]   - I don't think I've had it.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.020]   I mean, I've been to India, so I've had Indian breakfast,
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:24.300]   but I don't know if I've had like a westernized version
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:25.220]   of an Indian breakfast.
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:26.500]   - It's a British version.
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.940]   They kind of like combine Indian food
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:31.920]   with what would be considered like a British breakfast,
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.020]   but it's really good.
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.820]   And that's also if you struggle to get in,
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.820]   because they don't really take reservations
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.520]   at most of the locations, especially for dinner.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.400]   So either try to reserve for lunch,
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.520]   or go for breakfast if you can't get for lunch either.
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:49.240]   But some of the locations have really long lines,
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.320]   and people wait like an hour and a half.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.120]   I don't really think you should do that for anything,
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.000]   in my opinion.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.480]   There's ways we can get around that.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.280]   So try to reserve at lunchtime,
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.640]   go during the week at lunchtime, or go for breakfast.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.960]   - Are walk-ins a thing?
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.480]   In a lot of Japan, it's like,
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.560]   no, we fully book our tables,
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.360]   you can't necessarily walk in.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.700]   What about for us, who have two young kids,
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.460]   and like eating dinner at five o'clock is the norm?
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:12.300]   - That's doable.
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.020]   So we have a really big range.
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:16.820]   So some places will be reservations,
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:18.540]   and if they're booked up, they're booked up.
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.380]   Some places will have a mix of,
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:22.980]   they'll reserve half of it for walk-ins,
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:24.540]   and half of it for reservations.
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.780]   And then some places are walk-ins only.
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.060]   And for every budget, that varies.
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:31.180]   So it's not like if it's a budget restaurant,
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:32.260]   it's always walk-in.
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:35.060]   They sometimes will do reservations as well.
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:36.920]   If you're trying to find something
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.360]   that's like an easy walk-in,
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.720]   and you're kind of like, we've had a long day,
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.380]   I don't want to do too much research,
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.660]   pizza is really good here.
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:46.120]   There's a lot of places that do good Italian pizza
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.000]   for very affordable, and they do kids menus as well.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.120]   Like there's Pizza Pilgrims and Franco Manca.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.720]   Those are two different places.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.320]   They're fantastic, really easy.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.200]   You'll be able to get in, no problem.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.360]   - And you had one more Italian.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.600]   - Oh yes, I went here last night.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.320]   So it's fresh on the mind right now.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.560]   And it's in the guides as well,
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.400]   so you'll see it in there.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.860]   So it's called Padella,
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:09.160]   and they do basically simple pasta dishes.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.120]   And the word Padella comes from the Italian word
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.860]   that is, I forget exactly what the Italian word is,
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:17.440]   but it's how they actually make the pasta here,
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.320]   which is they finish it off in a pan.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:22.880]   Very simple, but really, really good, and also affordable.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:26.320]   This is a walk-in place, which if you go at 5.30,
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.960]   you're golden, you will be able to get in, no problem.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.360]   Otherwise, people queue up,
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.520]   or they have like a queuing system
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.600]   where they can text you when your table's ready.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:38.240]   If you go to Padella, my recommendations are
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.680]   to start with the burrata and order bread on the side,
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:44.000]   'cause the burrata there is so beautiful.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.600]   And then I always order the cacio e pepe.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.440]   It's the best cacio e pepe I've had in London.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.160]   It's not too cheesy, it's just really nice.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.080]   So those are always my recommendations,
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.360]   and I love going there.
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.240]   - This is awesome.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.960]   What about just general dining etiquette?
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.640]   Are meals slow, are meals fast?
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:01.880]   Is there something you need to know
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.120]   to get the attention of the wait staff,
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.520]   tipping, all this stuff?
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.000]   - So things are generally a bit slower
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.440]   than say if we're comparing to the US.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.680]   Also, every place is very understaffed right now.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:17.280]   So just kind of pack your patience pants when you come,
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.720]   because I mean, Chris, you're coming very soon,
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.520]   and it's a very, very busy time of year.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.480]   So things are just generally slower,
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.920]   but it's probably gonna continue like that
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.320]   for the next year or so.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.560]   Patience, definitely.
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:31.200]   - So you probably will have to ask for the server,
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.720]   unless you're in a more high-end place,
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.680]   but you might have to a few times raise your hand
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:35.880]   and be like, "Can we get some more water?
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:36.720]   "Can we get this?"
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.560]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.440]   And you definitely will have to ask for the bill.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.720]   And then do you want me to go through tipping
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:42.560]   for restaurants?
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.200]   - Yeah, wherever it applies, beyond restaurants.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.040]   - Okay, perfect.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.400]   So for restaurants in London,
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.000]   generally what happens is you will get the bill,
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.800]   and on the bill it will say optional service charge,
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.880]   and that's generally 12 1/2%
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:57.640]   that's been added onto your bill.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.320]   If you've had really bad service,
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.440]   you can ask for that to be removed.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.920]   Generally, people just end up paying it,
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.480]   even if they weren't super happy.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.480]   But once you've paid that service charge,
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.840]   you don't have to tip anything additional on top of that,
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.720]   and that service charge usually gets distributed
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.240]   between front of house and back of house.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.280]   So it doesn't only go to your server,
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.880]   it just gets put into the pool,
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.800]   and it goes to people in the kitchen as well.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.200]   In terms of tipping for other things,
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.240]   we're not a huge tipping culture here.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.760]   If you're at the hotel
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.000]   and your bags have been carried for you,
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.440]   you could tip, but you won't make anyone upset if you don't.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.360]   But of course, no one's gonna be upset
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:35.800]   about some extra money.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.680]   For taxis and things like that,
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:40.000]   you can round up to the next pound,
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.360]   or if you had someone who was really great
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:43.400]   and you had a long journey from the airport or something,
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.120]   you can give an extra couple of pounds.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.720]   But it's not extremely expected.
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:49.480]   I'm in my very British mode now.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.400]   What else do people usually tip on?
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.720]   (laughs)
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.120]   - I don't know, you'd get a drink at a bar,
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.160]   and you leave a couple of bucks.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:59.880]   - So if you go up to the bar and you're ordering yourself,
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.920]   so someone's not come to your table,
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.680]   then you do not have to tip.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:07.160]   You can, so sometimes people will leave a pound coin,
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.880]   sometimes a bar will have a jar where you can leave tips.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.680]   There's also this thing where you can say,
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.920]   "Oh, can I buy you one as well?" to the bartender,
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:19.560]   and then they will basically charge you for another drink,
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:22.480]   and then that money will go into a pot
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:24.280]   for everyone at the end of the night.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.400]   Sometimes it's a little bit dodgy
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.280]   if they actually get that, so if you do wanna tip,
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.520]   I would just say, "Leave a pound coin or two,"
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:31.920]   and that's gonna be the best option,
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.040]   but you don't have to.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.720]   I never tip at the bar.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:36.600]   Occasionally, if I've had someone really good,
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.760]   I'll pop something into if they have a tip jar,
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.480]   but it's definitely for sure not expected at all,
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.880]   and there will be no service charge added onto your bill
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.120]   if you order at the bar.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.560]   If you got table service,
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.840]   then service charge will probably be added,
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.920]   and if it's not, then you can leave
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.040]   around 10% if you'd like.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.440]   - So while we're on the topic of drinking at a bar,
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.120]   it might not be as relevant to our trip,
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.640]   but I wanna talk a little bit about nightlife
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.360]   because I feel like London is well-known for it.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.600]   Let's talk about what people should be doing at night
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.060]   who aren't in the situation we are
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:08.600]   with two kids, two and under.
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:09.560]   What's nightlife like?
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:10.400]   Where should people go?
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.040]   What should people be doing?
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.280]   - So the biggest areas for nightlife in London
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:18.080]   are generally Soho and Shoreditch.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:21.280]   So Soho's the very center of London.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:22.580]   It's very eclectic.
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:26.440]   It's also where the majority of the LGBTQ+ clubs
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.120]   and bars are, so anyone who's looking for that,
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.400]   Soho is your place for that.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.720]   And then Shoreditch is a little bit more artsy-ish,
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:37.240]   but also very popular for all different types of people
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.360]   who wanna go out.
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:41.740]   Both areas have both cheap and cheerful drinking.
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:43.800]   That's very rowdy and crowded.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:47.040]   They've got the cocktail bars, wine bars,
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.580]   and then both also have clubs.
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:51.920]   Not gonna lie, clubs are not really my thing anymore,
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:54.080]   but I can give a couple of recommendations
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.100]   off the top of my head.
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:58.320]   So in Soho, there's a club called Freedom,
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.640]   which is quite popular.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.840]   They've got a pretty standard upstairs,
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:02.880]   and then down in the basement,
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:05.520]   they've got DJs and a dance floor.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:06.520]   And then for Shoreditch,
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.960]   we had a really famous place there that just got shut,
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:12.520]   but actually, you can just walk around
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:15.480]   and follow the crowds and hear the music,
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.080]   and then you can find places that way.
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.520]   So it's pretty easy.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:19.480]   - Awesome.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:21.320]   And then what time do things close?
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.080]   Does transportation still run?
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:26.600]   - Transportation generally stops at midnight
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:27.840]   when we talk about the tube.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.520]   If you are out past midnight, there are a couple of options.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:32.920]   There are night buses.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.640]   They have an N in front of the number,
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:37.520]   and so if you're using CityMapper or Google Maps
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.560]   and you're trying to get back to your hotel,
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:42.560]   you might see N87, and that will be a night bus,
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:43.880]   and those run all night.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:46.200]   There are also some night tubes,
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.520]   which run all night as well on Friday and Saturday nights,
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.080]   so Google Maps might be like, "Oh, go on this line,"
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.680]   and that's because it's running all night.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.040]   Both of those are generally pretty safe options,
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.320]   but also, of course, you can get taxis.
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:00.480]   So you can either use Uber or FreeNow
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.000]   if you wanna call a taxi,
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   or if you see a black cab,
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.160]   which we're quite famous for our black cabs here,
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.840]   and it's got a light on,
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.000]   that means that it's free and available,
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.440]   so you can put your hand out and call it,
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:13.080]   and they'll pull over and take you.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.120]   - Do one of those apps also call,
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:15.960]   like if you're like,
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.520]   "I wanna take the London black cab experience,"
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.460]   which I've heard actually for kids is easy
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:21.560]   'cause you could roll a stroller in and set it down,
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:22.760]   and it's not so crazy.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:26.840]   - Yes, both Uber and FreeNow call black cabs.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:29.200]   I know Uber does, I'm pretty sure FreeNow does,
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.920]   and yes, I 100% agree.
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:32.720]   Also, anybody who might be traveling
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:34.480]   with someone with a wheelchair,
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.320]   the black cabs are the best option
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.560]   because the seats fold up,
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:38.920]   so they can accommodate wheelchairs.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.320]   So wheelchairs, buggies,
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.880]   which is the British term strollers, things like that,
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.760]   also, if you just have a lot of bags too,
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.040]   they're best for that.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:49.600]   And then in terms of when the actual nightlife closes,
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.160]   so generally, pubs will only stay open
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.280]   'til about 11, 11.30.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.880]   Bars will stay open 'til about 2, 2.30,
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:59.360]   and then the clubs, a lot of them shut at four,
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.040]   but also a lot of them go a lot later than four,
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:04.740]   so depending on which one you decide to go to.
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:07.580]   - I can assure you that I am more likely
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:10.440]   to be waking up at four than still awake at four.
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.520]   So that makes sense.
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:14.600]   I feel like we're planning on doing a lot more
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.160]   public transit than taxis.
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:17.960]   What about the airport getting in?
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:19.040]   Any tips there?
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:21.540]   - We do have six different airports here in London.
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:24.040]   Most people who are flying from the U.S.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.400]   or just doing the big, long-haul flights
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.800]   will fly probably into Heathrow Airport.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.300]   That's our main airport and our biggest one.
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:34.640]   That is technically still kind of London,
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.720]   but it's actually not really,
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.160]   so it is quite far west of the city,
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.240]   but it's very easy to get into Central.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.120]   Of course, you can take a taxi or an Uber
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:42.940]   if you want to,
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:45.320]   but we have lots of really good public transport options,
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:48.720]   with the main couple being the Elizabeth Line,
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:52.320]   which only just launched a few months ago back in May,
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.040]   and that is basically like a tube line,
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:59.120]   and it can actually get you into Paddington Station.
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.920]   It can get you into Central London.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.920]   It also can get you to East London
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.700]   to Liverpool Street Station,
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:09.400]   and it only costs £12.70 at the moment, which is great.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.900]   There's also the Heathrow Express,
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.500]   which gets into Paddington,
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.560]   and it's faster than the Elizabeth Line.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.520]   It only takes about 16 minutes, I think it is,
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:21.040]   but it's also £25 per adult,
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.160]   although kids under 16 go free with an adult.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.280]   It also doesn't really make sense
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.420]   to take the Heathrow Express,
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:29.920]   'cause you might not be staying anywhere near Paddington,
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.160]   so your best bet really is to use City Mapper or Google Maps
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.520]   and navigate from Heathrow to your hotel
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.820]   and see which options are saying for you,
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:41.920]   but also make sure you adjust for your arrival time,
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.920]   because if it's really early or really late,
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:49.280]   then the availability drastically reduces.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.680]   So then you might actually get stuck just taking a taxi
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.120]   or a very, very long night bus.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.080]   - We were talking about nightlife.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.000]   I know the London theater scene is pretty big.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.640]   In New York, my wife and I hit up a lot of Broadway shows.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.240]   We did the Rush stuff to get discounts on tickets.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.340]   We did all the kind of cool, crazy theater,
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.280]   immersive stuff like Sleep No More.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.760]   Anything stand out in those areas?
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.680]   - Yes, so the people who have done Sleep No More,
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.440]   so Punch Drunk, they recently have opened
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.560]   a similar to Sleep No More show
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.760]   called The Burnt City here in London,
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.760]   and I just went last week and it was awesome.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.480]   Highly, highly recommend it.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.880]   For people who don't know what that is,
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.200]   it's like immersive theater.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.440]   First of all, if you're a viewer, you have to wear a mask.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.000]   You always have to keep this mask on,
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   and you go into what's like this huge set.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.440]   - And we don't mean like a COVID mask.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.920]   We're talking like face mask.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.760]   - Exactly.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.560]   It kind of looks like the scream mask a little bit.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.080]   Not as quite as scary, I think.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.520]   And then what you do is you go into what is like
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.600]   basically a massive movie set
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.440]   that has multiple different rooms
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.880]   and all these different props,
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.920]   and you see live actors
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.200]   that are acting out different scenarios.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.000]   And sometimes they interact, sometimes they split ways,
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.280]   and you follow all of these people around
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.760]   and follow their stories.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.480]   And the details are amazing.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.840]   Like even the smells of the room are different.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.280]   Chris, I know I'm preaching to the choir here.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.240]   You've done all this already,
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:13.280]   but it was a really amazing theatrical experience.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.600]   They're running until April, I think, at the moment.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.440]   So if you're in London before April, 2023,
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.680]   definitely check that out.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.040]   But if you wanna do something a little bit more traditional
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.520]   in the London theater scene,
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:27.080]   there is the longest running theater show of all time
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.000]   here in London,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.840]   which is called Agatha Christie's "The Mousetrap."
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:32.680]   And it's been on for 70 years.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.560]   So this is the 70-year anniversary.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.000]   So it's actually quite special
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.920]   if you end up getting like,
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.120]   I guess it's only a few people will be able to get there.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.600]   Before, it's a 71st year, but still.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:46.760]   It is like a linchpin of London theater,
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.920]   and it's very kind of old school.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:53.440]   And it very much represents British whodunit theater,
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.920]   which is a little bit like over the top,
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.680]   but it's really fun and it's really cool.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.440]   It's just definitely like a very London experience.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.880]   So I would highly recommend people get tickets to that.
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.400]   And you can actually get like 15 pound tickets for that,
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.760]   even if you book in advance,
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.080]   if you just go for the really high up seats,
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.360]   but they also do some last minute deals as well,
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.640]   which you can get through TKTS,
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.760]   or it's also called Official London Theater.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.720]   - Wow, okay.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.320]   I feel like this is a masterclass in London,
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.160]   which was the goal.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.560]   We talked, I think, about most of the things
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.520]   people need to plan out in advance.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.600]   So I just wanna recap,
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.440]   like make your reservations at restaurants
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.920]   if you wanna go to hotspots
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.800]   and you wanna eat in prime time.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.680]   Any tickets for things,
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.840]   especially during peak season tourist attractions,
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.640]   any other things that people really need to make sure
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.440]   they figure out before they get there?
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.320]   - If you're doing peak season,
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.080]   anything that you can book in advance is a good idea.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.640]   'Cause also ever since COVID,
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:49.040]   a lot of the major attractions are now having timed entry.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.520]   Not all of them stick to it,
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:53.080]   but they will sell out for a certain time.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.880]   So if you've got a pretty strict schedule
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.240]   that you wanna stick to,
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.880]   then at least give yourself a couple of days ahead of time
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:03.480]   to book the tickets so you don't have to worry about like,
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.160]   oh, well now we didn't get the time that we wanted,
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.320]   so we're gonna have to run back
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.800]   and do this and do that, blah, blah, blah.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.280]   I would say in 2023,
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.080]   anyone who's visiting tourism
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.640]   has really come back with a vengeance.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:17.960]   And we're already seeing availability of hotels really low
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.040]   for even like the end of next year.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:24.080]   So I would definitely recommend anyone coming next year
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.920]   to book hotel as quickly as possible.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:29.280]   You can always do something that you can cancel,
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.680]   but it would just be good to have something
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.480]   just in case you don't find anything else
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.920]   at the price that you're looking for.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.360]   So just get it done, do it in advance.
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.400]   - Any favorites amongst the hotels
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.260]   that fall in that category of like,
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.960]   you might not find them on the major sites,
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.320]   you might overlook it 'cause it seems like it
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.720]   is this random property?
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.000]   - Yeah, so there's one place I really like,
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.320]   again, in East London, it's called Mama Shelter.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.600]   I think it's a Parisian brand
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.760]   'cause they've got a few places in France.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.160]   - And LA.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.800]   - Oh, that's right, they've got the one in LA, yeah.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.760]   - I helped our au pair book a room there like six months ago
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.280]   so and she said it was really cool.
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.240]   - Yeah, they've got a really nice rooftop at that one,
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.080]   it's really nice.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:10.200]   The one here, I think gets overlooked sometimes
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.760]   because it's a little bit out of the way
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.520]   if you wanna do only the main attractions,
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.920]   but it's actually really well located
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.200]   if you wanna do some of the more local stuff
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.040]   in East London.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.400]   For example, it's not far from Broadway Market,
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.520]   which is this Saturday market that's quite famous now,
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.760]   lots of great stalls selling food and jewelry
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.960]   and artisan pieces and things like that.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.440]   Also walkable in about 20 minutes to Shoreditch
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:36.160]   or there's a bus that will get you there even quicker.
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.880]   And I would say it's on the higher range of budget hotels,
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:43.400]   but the staff are amazing, it's really colorful.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.880]   They do karaoke nights, they've got a gym there.
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.760]   And if you book in advance,
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.080]   you can get a pretty good deal there.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.440]   So that's probably one of my favorite recommendations
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.560]   for hotels.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.480]   - Anything on the next tier up, like the mid range?
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.560]   - The mid range, so I really liked the Henrietta Hotel.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.640]   It's more luxury.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.440]   The Henrietta Hotel is right in Covent Garden.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:05.280]   It is a small boutique hotel that is French inspired
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.280]   and really beautiful decor.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.120]   You can't get any better on the location.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.440]   You just walk out the front door,
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.520]   you're in Covent Garden, it's amazing.
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.360]   And the rooms are beautiful and they're big
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:16.040]   and the bathrooms are amazing.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.920]   And then I have a really special luxury
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.480]   high-end recommendation.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.440]   We talked about the Shangri-La earlier.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:26.200]   That hotel is the highest hotel in London, obviously,
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.040]   'cause it's in the tallest building in Western Europe.
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.800]   And it is super special too,
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.480]   because they have an indoor pool,
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:37.760]   which is the highest hotel pool in Western Europe,
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.240]   but probably a lot of other parts of Europe as well.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.720]   So it's got floor to ceiling windows
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.040]   and you're just swimming around,
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.120]   looking down onto London and across the skyline.
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.620]   It's a pretty special experience.
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:50.460]   I recommend that one.
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:53.440]   We filmed a video in one of their suites there.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.320]   It was like the coolest experience.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.920]   It was awesome.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:57.760]   - There are gonna be a lot of links
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.080]   in the show notes to anything you mentioned.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.920]   Send me all those links also.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.760]   For anyone who's new and hasn't heard,
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.000]   we have a hotel booking service at All The Hacks
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.120]   for like those five-star hotels.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.200]   Can hook you up with usually an upgrade,
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.640]   a property credit, late check-in, early check-out,
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.240]   free breakfast, all that stuff.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.840]   So you just go to allthehacks.com/upgrades
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.440]   and you can see that.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.160]   A couple other hotel things.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.920]   So one, this is new for me, normally we stay at hotels.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.320]   And we're never really the Airbnb type.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.240]   And then we started traveling with a family
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.960]   and we were like, okay, we got two adults,
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.560]   two kids and an au pair.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.680]   We were looking at hotels.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.240]   One of the challenges in Europe
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.600]   is that a lot of hotels have capacity limits on rooms.
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.840]   I do know that if you are booking a chain,
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:42.200]   whether it's Hyatt or Accor or Marriott or Hilton,
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:45.000]   I think almost all of them have a program in Europe,
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.720]   including some of the hotels in London
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.040]   where you get 50% off the second room.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.000]   So definitely inquire.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.240]   It's not just if you book two rooms,
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.000]   but if you book two rooms and your kids are coming,
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.760]   they give you a deal for that second room.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.680]   That's true in a lot of other places.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:01.620]   And then we booked an Airbnb and I didn't know this,
[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.800]   but you can negotiate Airbnbs.
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.960]   And so we saw a place, we're planning it pretty last minute.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.120]   And we were like, hey, you have six days free.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.920]   We're gonna be there for those exact six days you have free.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.520]   We're coming in a week.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.720]   Your place is a little nicer
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:16.920]   than some of the places we're looking at
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:17.880]   and it's a little more expensive.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.280]   If you could bring it down 25%, we'd book it.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.900]   And we did that for London.
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:23.140]   We're also going to Paris
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:26.200]   and both places brought the price down about 20%
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:27.160]   and we booked it right away.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.560]   And so we were able to save 20%.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.720]   Normally, I think the idea of staying at a hotel
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:31.680]   where you got free breakfast
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.100]   and there's a lot more things figured out was easier.
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:36.400]   But it turns out if you're two adults,
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.920]   two kids and an au pair,
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.080]   we just couldn't find a hotel setup that worked,
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.400]   especially over the holidays,
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.840]   where we would be able to have a place
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:43.920]   that we could hang out
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.440]   while the kids are sleeping in the rooms.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.800]   For the next little bit, it's gonna be hard for us.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.240]   - Can I give a recommendation
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:52.200]   for anyone who is looking for something like that
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:55.520]   and wants to do almost like a service department?
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.480]   - I don't even know what that means,
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.480]   but of course you can.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:59.320]   - It's like an apart hotel, I would say.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.920]   So there's this brand here in London
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.880]   called the Cheval Residences.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:05.240]   You can get pretty good deals there
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.080]   if you book in advance.
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.840]   So you just have to kind of like play it out.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:12.840]   But they've got one property that overlooks Tower Bridge
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.920]   and they have apartments.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.080]   You can get like two bedroom.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.920]   I think they have three bedroom as well.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.520]   And they're great with kids
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:22.760]   because they can provide anything you might need,
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.760]   like cribs, high chairs.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.880]   You can accommodate stuff if you wanna bring your pets.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.120]   Anything you basically need, they can give it to you.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.160]   And then this place is extra special
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.840]   because if you get one of the Riverside places,
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.600]   you wake up and you go on your little balcony
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.520]   and overlook Tower Bridge.
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.360]   It's amazing.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:42.800]   Personally for us, we try to dissuade people from Airbnb
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.160]   just because of the ethical side of it in London.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.160]   We're having a really bad housing crisis here.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:50.180]   So I usually try to push people to apart hotels
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:53.360]   and with families who need like the multiple rooms
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:54.960]   off of the living area,
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.440]   Cheval usually is like a really good option for that.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.400]   And it's really nice.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:04.840]   - Well, I apologize for contributing to your London problems.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.680]   - It's okay.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:06.600]   It's a tricky one.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.860]   You're not the only people who have struggled with that.
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:11.520]   And that's part of where Airbnb has flourished
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.360]   is for stuff like that.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.660]   So it's not to shame you or anything,
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:15.360]   but I try to give alternatives.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.440]   - And on the topic of kids,
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.660]   what's the vibe of bringing your kids around?
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:20.280]   People are annoyed by it.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.400]   Are they cool?
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:22.240]   What should we be thinking?
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.320]   Can you give my wife breastfeed in public?
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.720]   I know London's a little conservative.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.320]   - She can definitely breastfeed in public.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.320]   That's totally fine.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.200]   You know, I don't have kids,
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.760]   so I can't like fully speak for families
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.760]   who are going out in the world all the time
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:34.920]   in London with children.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.240]   Most of the time though,
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:39.100]   as long as the kids are fairly well-behaved
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:43.000]   and they're feeling okay, it's pretty doable,
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.120]   especially during the day.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.300]   Like you can take the kids anywhere during the day.
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.800]   All restaurants will take them.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.840]   They'll accommodate them.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.560]   All of the sites and everything, obviously.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.080]   And like we talked about pubs,
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.840]   you can take the kids to the pubs during the day as well.
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:58.040]   So generally the reception is good.
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.840]   And I have been told by parent friends
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.160]   that the reception is better in London
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.760]   than like New York and some of the other major cities
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.120]   that they've been in.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:09.120]   - Well, I am incredibly excited for this trip.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.760]   I have one last thing before we wrap.
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.800]   We're not gonna put this in the show notes.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.800]   You've already given a lot of great recommendations,
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.480]   but is there one like best kept secret
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.140]   that you were like, I don't really want anyone to know
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:21.960]   that this restaurant is here, it's my favorite,
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.440]   it's not crowded yet or bar or something
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.320]   that we can leave right at the end of the episode
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.380]   only for the people that are still here?
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:29.520]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.920]   There's a cocktail bar that's called Lounge Bohemia
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.480]   and it is in Shoreditch.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.080]   I had passed it a million times.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.560]   It's just like a very random door.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.120]   I would say it's speakeasy vibes.
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:47.200]   I'd pass it a million times over my nine, 10 years here
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.800]   and someone eventually was like,
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.640]   "Oh, you've never been there.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.480]   "You should go try it."
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.320]   And I was like, "Okay."
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.200]   And I randomly went in there one day
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:57.120]   and it's this tiny, tiny little basement bar
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.080]   that has like 10 seats
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.360]   and they do very experimental cocktails.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:08.760]   Basically the guy who runs it who ironically does not drink.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:11.400]   So his wife tests all the cocktails for him
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.880]   but he runs this bar as like a tester
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:18.280]   for the work that he does for like corporate events
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.640]   and things like that.
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.400]   And he gets hard to do these like crazy, crazy,
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:25.000]   huge special events, really high end.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.600]   But you can go to Lounge Bohemia
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.560]   and you can do a tasting menu
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.800]   and it's I believe five different cocktails
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.720]   that are like off the wall.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:38.040]   Like one of the cocktails I had,
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.800]   it was called a Canadian breakfast
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.320]   and they brought out this little tray
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:47.240]   that had a little pan of blueberry pancakes
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.880]   and then they lit a fire and like cooked the pancakes
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.880]   and then you mixed up the jam
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.480]   and that was like part of the drink
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:57.720]   and then you put the pancakes in the drink.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.240]   It's just crazy stuff like that.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.400]   One of the cocktails was called Winnie the Pooh
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.600]   and it has an actual bee on the side of it.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.160]   I'm vegetarian so I made sure that no bees were hurt
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.400]   in the making of this cocktail.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.560]   They're residual bees from, I forget what he was,
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:12.600]   he said it was exactly,
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.600]   that would have just gone to waste anyway actually.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:18.000]   But it's an actual bee that sits on the side of the drink
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.760]   and you can eat it.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.640]   So it's like off the wall, crazy, crazy stuff.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.640]   Because it's so small, you do need to book ahead
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:30.000]   but if you're like a cocktail connoisseur
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.240]   who really likes off the wall, crazy stuff,
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.040]   that's like the best place to go.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.240]   - I feel like you just described me.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:37.320]   I'm like, I love crazy, weird cocktail.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:40.200]   The only twist that would make it like hit every mark for me
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.960]   is if it was also a spicy cocktail.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.040]   But I'm sure there is one there that meets that criteria.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.640]   So. - Yes, definitely.
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.720]   - Okay, so I've been fortunate to peruse
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:51.800]   a ton of your content but where can everyone here go
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.400]   to plan their next trip
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.760]   and get all the stuff you're putting out?
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:59.200]   - So everything is under the name Love & London.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:02.320]   We have over 300 YouTube videos at this point
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:05.720]   talking about how to take the tube, where to eat,
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:07.960]   things like that, mistakes not to make.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.080]   We also have a website.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:13.160]   We've got Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest and email lists.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.800]   So there's tons of free content
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:18.000]   and then we've got a few of our paid guides
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.560]   like the itineraries that we talked about
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.440]   which are all linked on the website.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.400]   - And there's a one-on-one guide that's also free
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.360]   that I'll link to in the show notes, which was great.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.880]   Like just kind of high level overview.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.480]   One thing that I think is the like crown jewel
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.240]   of the content that you sell
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.640]   is so much of my trip planning
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.740]   is usually done in Google Maps.
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:38.400]   And we're just really far behind on this trip
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.160]   because we planned it a week ago.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:43.040]   And in the guide, it was like, click here, boom,
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.440]   here is your Google Map.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.480]   And I was like, what?
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:49.520]   So I now have this like better than I normally would lay out
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:51.400]   like with icons of this is a restaurant,
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.240]   this is a bar, that kind of stuff.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:58.240]   And I think that that is undersold on your website
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:01.000]   because I think you could just sell
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.520]   for maybe even the same price, the Google Map of it.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.600]   So that was my favorite feature
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.840]   is that now I have Google Maps loaded on my phone
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.640]   where I'm like, when we're out and about,
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.720]   we know what we're doing and we could find cool spots.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.600]   So thank you for putting those in there.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:14.440]   - Yeah, of course.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.940]   - Make sure everyone else knows about them.
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:18.000]   - Cool, I added that 'cause I was like,
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.800]   I feel like when I get stuff like this,
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.840]   I'm always just adding it to Google Maps anyway.
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.020]   So I'm like, why don't I just do it for them?
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:25.960]   So it made sense.
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:29.200]   Also, we do have something for your listeners.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.060]   We do have a special discount that can be used
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.660]   in the Love in London shop,
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:36.540]   which is where you can buy all of our digital travel guides.
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:40.020]   So we will put a little discount code
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:44.220]   for 10% off the entire shop in the show notes
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:45.860]   or we'll put it somewhere.
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:46.860]   - Yeah, we'll put it in the show notes.
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:48.100]   Yeah, we'll put it in the show notes
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.580]   so you can find that and everybody can check that out.
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:51.660]   Thank you for doing that.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.500]   And even more, thank you for being here.
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.020]   I'm so excited about this trip
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:57.040]   and we have a lot of stuff to figure out.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.040]   - Good, no, it's great.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:01.120]   Thank you so much for having me, I appreciate it.
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.020]   - I wish I could say
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.680]   that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day,
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.280]   but the reality is that I am definitely not.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.160]   So I love having an easy way
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:11.380]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:14.240]   which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.120]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.360]   for this episode.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.360]   I started taking it because I wanted to see
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.680]   what all the hype was about
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:23.800]   and I've kept it in my daily routine for months.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.160]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:29.320]   add a few ice cubes, it tastes so good when it's cold,
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.520]   and I head to my office feeling focused
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.880]   and energized for the day,
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.640]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:39.020]   I also love that it's made from 75 high-quality vitamins,
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:40.480]   minerals, and superfoods
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.320]   and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:45.780]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals,
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.480]   or artificial anything.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.240]   To make giving it a try easy,
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.760]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.680]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.080]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:03.080]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:07.120]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:09.160]   to take ownership over your health
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:12.200]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.720]   In today's internet age,
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.720]   people's personal information is being shared online
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.320]   with the click of a button without their consent
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.400]   and it happens all the time.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.040]   But you can tackle this problem
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.920]   thanks to Delete Me from Abine
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.800]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.240]   for this episode.
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.520]   When I used to Google myself,
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:33.080]   I would find hundreds of detailed profiles
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.600]   sharing my cell phone number, address, email,
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.040]   family members, and a lot more.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.480]   At first, I actually tried to remove it all myself,
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:43.280]   which you can do, but after at least 10 hours,
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:46.360]   I signed up for Delete Me and it was so much easier.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:48.220]   Their software and team of experts
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:51.140]   will not just find and remove your personal information
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:53.600]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.360]   but they'll continuously scan for new data
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:59.400]   that shows up and get that removed as well.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.560]   On average, Delete Me finds and removes

[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:45.080]   Okay, we just got back from our trip last night
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.720]   and I wanna do a quick recap
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:48.200]   of some of the awesome highlights,
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:50.400]   things we did, share some stories,
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:53.120]   as well as talk to you about how to get the best deals
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:54.600]   on your trip to London,
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:57.840]   especially when it comes to using your points on flights.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:01.500]   So, first off, I just have to say the trip was awesome,
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:04.280]   but wow, doing a trip like that with kids
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.280]   is so much different.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.800]   This isn't the first time we've traveled with kids,
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.940]   but our other trips have been to stay with family
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:13.960]   or go to the beach and not to explore a city.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.520]   So, I've been saying that there's this whole parenting
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.000]   episode on the horizon that I wanna do with Amy,
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.420]   and now that this trip is over,
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:22.240]   we're gonna try to get that done soon
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:25.360]   and we'll talk all about what it's like to travel with kids
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.120]   because it is very different.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.920]   So, stay tuned for that,
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:31.840]   and until then, let me talk about London.
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:35.360]   First off, it was so amazing to be there in the winter.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:39.100]   I don't think any season does the holidays like London.
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.160]   There are holiday decorations everywhere
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:44.560]   and strung lights above every other street downtown.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:47.000]   It really felt like a magical place,
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.920]   and I'm pretty sure another holiday trip
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.380]   will be there in our future.
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:52.280]   I'll run through a bunch of the things we did,
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.920]   and I'll try not to repeat anything
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.640]   Jess and I already discussed.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.720]   First off, we ended up staying at an Airbnb
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.960]   because with two kids that go to bed early
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.360]   and an au pair with us,
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:05.160]   it was gonna be two to three times the price to do a hotel,
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.400]   and while we definitely missed
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.400]   some of the amenities of a hotel,
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.200]   the ability to do laundry, have a place to hang out
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.360]   while the kids were asleep,
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.440]   and just generally having more space
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:17.240]   outweighed what a hotel had to offer for this trip.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:20.920]   That said, we certainly had quite the Airbnb experience.
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:24.220]   First off, I learned all about Airbnb negotiating,
[01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:26.000]   which I didn't realize was a thing
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.160]   until I just tried it myself.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.620]   Since we were booking last minute,
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:31.920]   I figured why not reach out to the more expensive,
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:34.600]   nicer place and see if they would offer a discount
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.600]   of 20 to 25%.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.120]   Sure enough, it worked,
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:41.040]   and I actually since have talked to a few hosts
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:44.760]   who've told me that anywhere from 20 to 50%
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:47.200]   of the people staying with them try to negotiate,
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.800]   and they often make special offers.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.880]   So if you're booking an Airbnb,
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.520]   definitely ask if you can get a deal
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.120]   and you might get rewarded.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.440]   We actually spent a week in Paris before London.
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:00.120]   I won't cover that in this episode,
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:02.540]   but we ended up getting a deal at both places.
[01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:04.520]   The person in London actually first said
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:07.560]   they'd only give us a deal if we booked off Airbnb
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:10.480]   and wired the money, but I didn't wanna take that risk.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:12.920]   I didn't wanna lose the Airbnb protections,
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:15.200]   which became very important.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.520]   So we ended up settling on a discount a little bit less,
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:21.560]   closer to 15%, but it ended up being the best move.
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.000]   So when we got to London,
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.240]   we checked into what we thought
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:26.200]   was gonna be an incredible place.
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:29.100]   It was in an amazing location near Paddington Station
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:30.040]   and Hyde Park.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.180]   It had great reviews,
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:35.200]   but it was pretty downhill from there.
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:38.400]   We checked in and it was almost 100 degrees upstairs
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.280]   in all the bedrooms, and the radiators were all so hot
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.640]   that you would burn yourself if you touch them,
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.720]   which is hard to explain to a toddler
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.040]   who loves to run around and touch everything.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.400]   So we tried to open the windows to cool it down,
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:54.720]   and in one bedroom, the windows were actually screwed shut,
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:58.680]   and the other bedroom had zero windows and zero ventilation.
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.960]   The carpets upstairs were also stained a bit.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.540]   The dishes weren't that clean.
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:05.180]   Some of the glasses in the cabinets had lipstick on them,
[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:07.180]   and then there was just this smell
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:09.260]   that was really hard to put your finger on
[01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:11.420]   because they had those little fragrance diffusers
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:14.020]   in every single room of the house trying to cover it up.
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:16.180]   The funny thing was that any one of those issues
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:18.280]   probably wasn't a big enough issue
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.300]   to send a message to the host about,
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:23.300]   but the next day we realized that the downstairs area,
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:25.180]   which was the living room and the kitchen,
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:26.980]   could not be heated.
[01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:29.060]   It was one of the coldest times ever.
[01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:31.220]   In fact, when we showed up, there was snow
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:32.840]   all over the place.
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:36.340]   So when we go to the thermostat and it says it's 86,
[01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:38.920]   but it actually feels like it's closer to 60,
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:41.760]   and there wasn't a single way to get the heat kicked in,
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:43.880]   it wasn't the most comfortable time.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.580]   So I didn't actually know what to do
[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:46.860]   in a situation like this.
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:49.420]   If it were a hotel, I'd just ask for a new room,
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:52.420]   ask for a partial refund, or get some bonus points,
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:55.260]   but for an Airbnb, it wasn't that clear.
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:57.180]   I didn't necessarily want them to send a cleaner
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:58.940]   to wash a handful of dishes.
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.380]   I didn't really think they were gonna be able
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:02.700]   to clean the carpets, and obviously,
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:04.740]   if they could fix the heat, that would be great,
[01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:06.820]   but I messaged them and they didn't seem
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:09.420]   the most responsive to that single issue.
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:12.480]   So I called Airbnb and asked them what I should do,
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:13.820]   and they were very underwhelming.
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:15.820]   They basically said, "Oh, well, we can call the host
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:17.220]   "and tell them about all the issues,"
[01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:18.660]   and I said, "Well, hold off.
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.300]   "Let me send a message to the host."
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.060]   So I wrote a long message to the host
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.900]   that detailed out all the issues,
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:26.220]   and I said, "Hey, let me know what you think
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:28.180]   "we should do about this."
[01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:30.200]   After that, I responded to Airbnb and said,
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:31.620]   "Hey, I'd reached out to the host,
[01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:33.160]   "so if you wanna connect with them as well,
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.220]   "you're welcome to, because I thought it would be good
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:37.380]   "to reach out to the host first."
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:38.940]   Well, it didn't go that well,
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:41.460]   because despite that I had emailed the host first,
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:43.480]   as soon as they heard from Airbnb,
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:45.780]   they sent me a message that they were very uncomfortable
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:48.240]   with the fact that I contacted Airbnb support
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.780]   before letting him resolve all the issues,
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:52.260]   and that he was no longer comfortable
[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:53.660]   with us staying in the home,
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:55.140]   and he would prefer that I checked out
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:56.580]   and found a new place to stay.
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:58.220]   So, the silver lining in this,
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:01.100]   which was a very frustrating and stressful experience,
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:04.100]   was that I got to put Airbnb's air cover protection
[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.180]   to the test.
[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:08.340]   Specifically, their get what you booked guarantee,
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:11.220]   which actually says, "If at any time during your stay,
[01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:12.980]   "your listing isn't as advertised,
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:15.100]   "for example, the refrigerator stops working
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.060]   "and your host can't easily fix it,
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:19.440]   "or it has fewer bedrooms than listed,
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.100]   "you'll have three days to report it,
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:23.540]   "and we'll find you a similar or better home,
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:24.760]   "or we'll refund you."
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.300]   So my biggest concern reading that,
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:28.620]   and all the subsequent terms around it,
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:30.200]   is that it wasn't very clear
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.660]   whether they would find you the bigger or similar home,
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:34.940]   or refund you, and in our case,
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:37.000]   a refund wouldn't have been very helpful,
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.420]   because there weren't a lot of places that we could book.
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:41.500]   Actually, there were pretty much none
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.180]   that were a similar size, quality,
[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:44.980]   and location at that price.
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:47.860]   So, I was a bit worried when the Airbnb support rep
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:49.700]   started sending me suggestions of places
[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:51.100]   they could help us rebook,
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:54.180]   because we had booked a nice three-bedroom place,
[01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:56.780]   and all of their suggestions were studios,
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:00.100]   or one bedrooms with nowhere near enough room.
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:02.940]   However, when I sent them the three-bedroom place
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:05.600]   that I found that had all the same amenities,
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:09.140]   was centrally located, had a crib, had laundry in the unit,
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:11.720]   they actually created a coupon for me
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:14.620]   that brought the price down by 50%,
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:16.700]   so we didn't have to pay any extra.
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:18.980]   So, two days into our six-night stay,
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.660]   we moved into an amazing place,
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:22.260]   and wow, was it an upgrade
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:24.060]   from the previous place we stayed at.
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:26.700]   It was in an incredible location in Covent Garden,
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:29.100]   and it was such a nice place.
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:30.660]   Funny enough, we had a similar issue
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:32.000]   with the heat going out,
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.420]   but this host had a very different attitude,
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:38.220]   and had six heaters delivered before the kids' next nap time,
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:39.780]   and scheduled an emergency plumber
[01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:42.160]   to get things fixed within 24 hours.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.480]   But the real highlight was the Harry Potter-themed kids' room.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:47.380]   I really can't describe how cool it was,
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:50.220]   so if you're curious, check out the link in the show notes.
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:52.260]   It had a train-themed bunk bed,
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:55.700]   a custom bookshelf that looked like a bunch of suitcases,
[01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:58.500]   a hollow tree with a reading area inside it,
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.780]   and a mini castle on one wall.
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:03.880]   I definitely have some inspiration for a future kids' room,
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:05.100]   but if you're ever in London,
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:08.260]   and this place is in your budget, I highly recommend it.
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:10.980]   It was discounted 35% because it was last minute,
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:13.600]   and then Airbnb covered half of the rest,
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:16.660]   so you probably won't get it for almost 70% off,
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:18.100]   but I will say that it was amazing,
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:20.500]   and we would love to stay there again.
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.380]   And even if that place isn't the right fit,
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:25.580]   I definitely recommend staying in the Covent Garden area.
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:28.060]   It was so central to so many things,
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:30.180]   and especially when you have kids,
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:32.260]   it means you don't lose all those short,
[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:34.780]   precious hours between naps on the train.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:37.260]   Okay, so that was maybe more than you asked for,
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:38.660]   but I thought it was worth sharing
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.940]   because one of my biggest fears with Airbnb
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:42.260]   is that you'll get stuck in a place
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:44.820]   that doesn't quite match the photos or the reviews,
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:46.740]   and you won't have a good alternative.
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.500]   Well, I now feel a lot better
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:51.780]   having put the air cover policy to the test.
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:53.060]   That said, going forward,
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:56.980]   I will put an even higher emphasis on reading those reviews,
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:58.840]   and once the kids are a bit older,
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:01.500]   I think hotels will definitely be back on the table,
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:03.480]   at least for trips in cities.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:05.220]   As for the rest of our time in London,
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.000]   let me share some highlights.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.700]   When it comes with transportation,
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:11.460]   being able to use Apple Pay or a tap-to-pay credit card
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:14.700]   to ride the Tube or a bus was so great.
[01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:16.020]   Coming off the heels of Paris,
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:17.740]   where we were carrying around 10 packs
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:20.620]   of paper Metro tickets that got demagnetized
[01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:22.700]   by being too close to our cell phones,
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:24.980]   it was so convenient and easy.
[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:27.020]   I did take a few Ubers for meetings,
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:28.840]   but if you wanna order a London cab,
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:31.940]   the app Free Now was what everyone said to use
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:33.540]   and was so easy.
[01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:35.260]   In fact, with an early morning flight
[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:37.340]   and a new Airbnb that wasn't that close
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.840]   to the Heathrow trains,
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:40.900]   we opted for a cab to get to the airport.
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:43.380]   Leaving at 6 a.m., it only took 40 minutes,
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:46.780]   and it was 73 pounds versus 40 pounds
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:50.660]   on the Elizabeth Line or 75 pounds on the Heathrow Express.
[01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:52.440]   Also, speaking of paying for things,
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:54.820]   there might be somewhere you need cash in London,
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:56.060]   but I never found it.
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:59.060]   Every restaurant, food stall, Christmas market vendor,
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:02.180]   and convenience store had a tap-to-pay credit card terminal
[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:06.300]   that made the cash I took from the ATM completely useless,
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:08.500]   though given the current exchange rate,
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.700]   those 200 pounds might be worth a lot more
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:11.820]   next time we visit.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:14.020]   As for activities, I'll review a few things.
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:16.380]   First, the London Transport Museum.
[01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:18.180]   Our daughter absolutely loved it,
[01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:20.420]   so if you have kids, I'd recommend it,
[01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:23.340]   but as someone who's pretty fascinated by transportation,
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.260]   I was a little underwhelmed.
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:27.580]   Hamleys, which is a gigantic toy store,
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:29.380]   was similarly loved by my daughter
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:31.220]   and even fun for the adults,
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.620]   but if you're going during the holidays
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:35.780]   and you wanna see Santa, you do need a reservation.
[01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:37.860]   We also checked out the Natural History Museum,
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:39.660]   which was really awesome.
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:41.780]   I don't think we had the time to do it justice,
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:45.260]   but it's a free museum and it was really impressive.
[01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:46.540]   We also went around the corner
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:48.860]   to do a science-themed afternoon tea
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:51.900]   at the Ampersand Hotel, which was so much fun,
[01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:53.740]   and while they're pretty expensive,
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:56.360]   I think that if we had planned things a little more,
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:58.900]   we might've even done a second afternoon tea,
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.780]   and despite the kids' theme,
[01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:04.900]   Amy, Marta, our au pair, and I all really enjoyed it as well.
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:07.660]   As for food, I have a few recommendations.
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:10.920]   It is hard to put anything higher on the list than Dishoom,
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:14.020]   which has a few amazing Indian restaurants in London
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:16.900]   with fantastic bars, delicious chai,
[01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:19.260]   and ridiculously good food.
[01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:21.680]   Specifically, I would definitely check out
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:25.520]   the House Black Doll, the Chicken Ruby, and the Sali Bhoti.
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:27.740]   They were so delicious.
[01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:30.460]   In fact, Dishoom was so good for dinner
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:33.660]   that we literally came back the next morning for breakfast,
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:36.940]   where you should not skip out on the double bacon naan roll,
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:40.460]   and then we came back again for breakfast a few days later.
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:43.980]   It is just so good, so definitely check it out.
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:45.060]   We didn't have a reservation
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.500]   any of the three times we went,
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.020]   but if you wanna go without waiting at dinnertime,
[01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:50.780]   I definitely suggest making one.
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:52.500]   We also went to Borough Market one day
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:55.800]   and ate all kinds of delicious food from the food vendors.
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:58.820]   If you find yourself on the northwest side of Hyde Park,
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:01.820]   Norma's Malaysian restaurant was amazing,
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:03.860]   and the Mitre Lancaster Gate Pub
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:06.180]   was a perfect spot for a pub dinner.
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:07.700]   Amy and I did have one dinner out
[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:09.780]   without the kids at Ave Mario,
[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:13.100]   which was such a fun place for a dinner with great food,
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:15.540]   but the Silk Handkerchiefs pasta dish
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:19.220]   I had down the street at Bancon the night before
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:22.860]   might've been one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had.
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:24.620]   Amy wasn't feeling great that night,
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:26.380]   so I had a solo dinner at the bar,
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:29.100]   and it was so good that I wish we had one more night
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:30.960]   so I could take her back.
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:33.420]   Finally, that same night, I snuck out on my own
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:36.660]   to check out Opium, the cocktail bar that Jess recommended,
[01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:40.180]   and it was awesome, definitely suggest heading there.
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:42.100]   I also tried to go to the Barbary,
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:45.440]   but they had zero room for walk-ins, so that didn't happen,
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.860]   but the Seven Dials Market around the corner
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:49.920]   is a fantastic alternative.
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:51.840]   It's like an indoor street market
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.700]   with a couple dozen food vendors
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:56.620]   with cuisines from every corner of the globe.
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:58.820]   My favorites were the bao from Yum Bun
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.420]   and the chai from Chai Guys,
[01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:03.520]   but I didn't get to try as many things as I wanted.
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:05.820]   So I think that covers my London recap,
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:08.020]   and if you're not excited about a trip to London
[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:09.540]   at this point, I'm really not sure
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:10.980]   why you're still listening,
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:12.440]   but I think you should be excited
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:13.900]   because it was so much fun,
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:15.940]   and I'm already looking forward to going back,
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:18.180]   and we literally just got home yesterday.
[01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:21.460]   So as for getting there, let's talk about flights.
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:24.860]   You can get to London from 33 different cities in the US,
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:27.340]   and almost all of those flights are to Heathrow,
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:29.180]   though a few of them are to Gatwick,
[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:30.860]   so if you're searching on Google Flights,
[01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:33.940]   make sure to put both airports as your destination,
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:36.380]   and those flights are across seven different carriers,
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:39.460]   but if you're willing to change planes in Canada or Europe,
[01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:42.180]   then you could probably add another two dozen airlines
[01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:43.420]   to that list.
[01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:45.500]   So what are the tactics?
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.300]   Because our dates were pretty specific,
[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:49.940]   I started doing my search on point.me,
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:51.500]   which, as I've said in the past,
[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:54.060]   is $1 for your first month on the standard plan
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:55.980]   if you use the code ALLTHEHACKS,
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:58.140]   but they actually sent me an email for the holidays
[01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:01.720]   saying that the next 25 people that wanna give it a try
[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:05.060]   can use ALLTHEHACKS for a free 24-hour pass.
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:07.740]   Now, if your dates aren't as flexible,
[01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:10.740]   I do tend to like searching on the airline websites more
[01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:13.600]   or using a tool called Seatspy,
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:14.900]   which lets you look at a calendar
[01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:17.780]   to look at more dates at once to try to find the best deals,
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:19.960]   but here's the summary for London,
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.900]   and this applies to Europe a little bit as well.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:25.060]   First, while British Airways and Virgin Atlantic
[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:26.500]   are great airlines,
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.740]   the taxes on their award flights can be so expensive.
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:33.160]   For business class, we're talking over $1,000 round trip
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:35.360]   per person just in taxes.
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.880]   It is a lot less in economy
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.600]   where you can actually find really great deals.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.740]   For example, on Virgin, you can get to London from the US
[01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:47.080]   for 12,500 to 15,000 points per person each way,
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:48.400]   so if you're doing economy,
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.640]   it could be worth checking out Virgin or British Airways.
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:53.420]   All that said, if you wanna fly business
[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:55.760]   and Virgin or British Airways are the only options,
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:58.640]   even with taxes at $1,500 a person,
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.220]   it's probably gonna be a better deal
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:02.860]   than paying for business class with cash.
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:04.300]   It's just not gonna be as good a deal
[01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:06.460]   as what you might find with the following options,
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:07.540]   which is what we did.
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.980]   I'll start with American, which is a great option,
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:12.020]   and it's a built transfer partner,
[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:13.540]   with round trip awards costing
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:17.180]   as little as 25 to 30,000 points each way in economy
[01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:19.780]   and 57,500 in business,
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:22.580]   and as long as you're booking on American planes
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:24.900]   and not British Airways, which is one of their partners,
[01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:27.300]   the taxes on their flights is pretty reasonable.
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:29.840]   For Star Alliance, you'll probably be flying on United
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:31.700]   unless you're changing planes in Europe,
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:35.320]   but you can book on any of the Star Alliance carriers.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:36.480]   If you book on United,
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:39.600]   it can be as low as 30,000 miles each way in economy,
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:43.380]   45,000 in premium economy, and 60,000 in business,
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:46.760]   but that same 60,000 point flight in business on United
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:49.440]   can actually be booked with Turkish Air,
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.720]   which is a built or Capital One transfer partner
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.720]   for 45,000 points.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:55.880]   In fact, that is exactly what we did.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:58.400]   I found four seats available in business
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:01.320]   for 60,000 points each way on United,
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:03.080]   and then set up a Turkish Air account
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:04.640]   and called them to book it.
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:05.840]   The other great thing about Turkish
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.280]   is you can actually book the award
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:08.680]   before you transfer the points,
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:11.600]   so you can be confident you're getting exactly what you want.
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:14.560]   It's a bit frustrating because you have to book on the phone,
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.000]   which is a bit of a pain,
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.320]   but I ended up saving about 60,000 points
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:19.360]   on those four tickets,
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.640]   so it was definitely worth the phone call.
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.300]   Also, no matter where you book that United flight,
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:26.280]   the taxes and fees are pretty reasonable
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:28.440]   at a few hundred dollars a person in business
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:29.800]   and even less in economy.
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:31.380]   The last option, and one of my favorites,
[01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:34.240]   is booking with Air France or KLM's Flying Blue,
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.760]   which happens to be a transfer partner
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:38.880]   of Chase, Amex, Cap One, Citi, and Built,
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:40.360]   so chances are you probably have a way
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.360]   to get your points to their program.
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:45.000]   On top of that, they have great availability to Europe,
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.780]   and both the miles needed and the taxes and fees
[01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:49.080]   are pretty reasonable,
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:51.720]   not to mention they frequently have transfer bonuses
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:53.320]   when you move miles over.
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:54.300]   For flights to Europe,
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:57.520]   it's gonna be as little as 25,000 points each way in economy
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.900]   and 55,000 in business.
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:01.920]   For our trip, the exact flights we wanted,
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.420]   which were nonstop from SFO to Paris in business,
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:09.100]   were actually 75,000 points plus $195 in taxes.
[01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:12.460]   However, since there was a 25% transfer bonus to Amex,
[01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:16.280]   we only needed 60,000 Amex points per person to do it,
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:20.500]   so we booked SFO to Paris nonstop on Air France
[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:23.700]   for 60,000 Amex points that we transferred to Air France
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:27.180]   and paid $195 per person in taxes and fees,
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:28.460]   and then to get home,
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:32.060]   we booked London to SF nonstop on United in business
[01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:34.080]   for 45,000 Capital One points
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:35.860]   that we transferred to Turkish Air
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:39.400]   plus $302 per person in taxes and fees.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.860]   So we booked four tickets, but per passenger,
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:46.400]   it was 105,000 points plus $500 in taxes
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:50.280]   to fly nonstop business class round trip to Europe.
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:53.660]   And when I looked at booking those flights nonstop
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:58.380]   in business with cash, it was about $7,000 per person,
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:02.000]   which means a value of a little over 6 cents per point,
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.660]   which is pretty damn good.
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:07.220]   One other thing to share is about bringing a lap infant.
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:09.140]   While on domestic flights, they're free,
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:12.260]   it is a totally different situation internationally.
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:15.740]   Depending on the airline, the cost can vary widely.
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:18.340]   For some airlines, it's a fixed number of miles,
[01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:21.220]   and for others, you have to pay 10 to 25%
[01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:24.100]   of the full fare cost of that business class ticket.
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:27.860]   So that's the $7,000 ticket that we never would have bought.
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:29.260]   On Air France, it was the latter
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:32.340]   at 10% of a full fare business ticket.
[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:37.340]   So we actually had to pay $643, which seems crazy,
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:40.620]   but it almost seemed crazier to spend the miles
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:42.400]   and the dollars to get a six-month-old,
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.340]   her own seat in business class.
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:45.860]   For booking the United flight,
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:48.240]   the cost of her seat was actually very different
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:50.100]   depending on how we booked it.
[01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:53.140]   If we'd done it on United, it would've been 10% of the fare,
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.440]   but it was capped at $250.
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:57.020]   Had we booked it on Air Canada,
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:59.380]   it would've just been 2,500 miles,
[01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:02.100]   but on Turkish, it was 10% of the adult miles,
[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:06.380]   so 4,500 miles in our case, plus taxes and fees,
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:08.220]   which for us was $88.
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:10.100]   Also note that most of these sites
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:12.760]   don't make it easy to book a lap infant online,
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:16.540]   so we had to call Air France and Turkish to do it manually.
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:19.740]   And fun hack, as soon as I found the availability
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:22.820]   I wanted on Air France, I wanted to book it quickly,
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:25.180]   but it was too late for the US reservations office
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:28.580]   to be open, and it was too early for the one in France.
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:30.220]   So I used Google Voice,
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:32.660]   and I called the Tokyo Air France office
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:33.940]   because it was open,
[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:36.900]   and we were able to get things booked right then.
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:39.700]   But this hack isn't just for when offices are closed
[01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:41.060]   and you need to make a booking.
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:45.220]   It is also great for when lines are busy in the US.
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:48.260]   So when there's major weather issues or delays in the US
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:50.460]   and calling United, American, or Delta
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:52.780]   has you stuck on long wait times,
[01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:55.260]   try calling the office in London, Tokyo,
[01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:57.260]   or any other country around the world,
[01:37:57.260 --> 01:37:59.700]   and you can usually get through right away.
[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:01.660]   Just make sure to use a service like Google Voice
[01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:03.380]   so the call isn't that expensive.
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:04.420]   Okay, so that's flights,
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:06.740]   but I do wanna briefly talk about booking hotels
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:09.800]   with points, even though we stayed at an Airbnb.
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:11.960]   The short version is that there are so many options
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:14.080]   at every price point that I feel good
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.900]   you can find something with your points,
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:18.740]   but because there are so many hotels in London
[01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:20.380]   and prices are competitive,
[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:22.500]   you might actually be better off saving your points
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:24.620]   for flights and just paying cash.
[01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:26.140]   However, if you do wanna use points,
[01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:27.480]   I'll share a few things.
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:30.620]   First, if you already have your points in a hotel program,
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:32.180]   then you'll probably just be using those
[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:33.500]   and searching from their site,
[01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:35.360]   and you probably are pretty familiar.
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.580]   If not, I think the only real way
[01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:39.020]   to get a good deal in London,
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:41.540]   at least on the luxury side of the spectrum,
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:44.660]   is to transfer Chase or BuiltPoints and bill with Hyatt.
[01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:48.340]   So I would start just searching straight on the Hyatt site.
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:50.740]   However, if you want a great map
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:53.560]   of all the points hotels options in London,
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.020]   I'll put it in the show notes.
[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:56.380]   I think it's a little out of date,
[01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:58.020]   but it's a good starting point.
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:38:59.660]   And I'll also put a link in the show notes
[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:01.180]   to a few articles I liked
[01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:02.960]   that specifically went through a bunch
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:06.300]   of London hotel options at different points budgets.
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:07.580]   And if you're booking for a family,
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:09.400]   you should know that a lot of hotels
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:11.920]   have max capacity limits in Europe.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:14.520]   Sometimes it's two, sometimes it's three people.
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:16.480]   So definitely make sure that when you're searching,
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:19.620]   you put the right number of guests in your search.
[01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:21.380]   In general, some of the best points options
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:23.280]   for families are Club Carlson,
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:25.480]   which lets you book premium or bigger rooms
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:27.000]   for not too many points.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.320]   Marriott, Hilton, and IHG are the most likely
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:32.720]   to have rooms with three plus person capacity.
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:33.940]   And some of the Hyatt hotels,
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:35.640]   like the Churchill and the Andaz,
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:37.560]   have some large rooms or suites
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:40.560]   that you can book for points that have larger capacities.
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.960]   Finally, if you're not gonna use points, two tips.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:46.840]   One, first, if you're looking for luxury hotels,
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:47.760]   definitely check out
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:50.340]   the All The Hacks Luxury Upgrade Program.
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:53.440]   You can find it at allthehacks.com/upgrade,
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:55.060]   where through a partnership I set up,
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:57.680]   we can get you free upgrades, free breakfast,
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:39:59.880]   late checkout, and a property credit
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:01.680]   at hotels in London like the Connaught,
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:04.680]   the Ham Yard, the Four Seasons, and dozens more.
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:05.520]   And this, by the way,
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:09.280]   applies to almost any other luxury hotel in the world.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.620]   Second, check out @hotel on Instagram and send them a DM.
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:17.040]   They sometimes have ridiculously good deals on hotels
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.220]   because of the fact that requiring you to DM them
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:22.580]   makes their access private,
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:24.280]   which means they can offer rates better
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:26.100]   than what you see on hotel websites
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:27.900]   or sites like booking.com.
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:29.360]   (upbeat music)
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:31.920]   Hopefully that helps you with hotels on your trip.
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:34.520]   And I think that covers everything for this episode.
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:37.640]   I am so curious to hear what you all think about this one,
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:39.240]   because I've never done a city
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:41.600]   or country-specific travel episode.
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:44.480]   So I would love any or all feedback
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:46.520]   so I know whether to keep doing them,
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:48.120]   what cities to prioritize,
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:51.120]   or if there's anything else I could do to make them better.
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:53.840]   Finally, happy holidays to everyone.
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:55.520]   I hope you have a wonderful time
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.720]   celebrating the holiday season with your families.
