[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.600]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.040]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.160]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.440]   and one of the areas I love optimizing the most is travel.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.800]   I've been to 60 plus countries,
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.920]   and on every trip I love meeting locals,
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.360]   trying to understand their culture,
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.240]   having authentic experiences,
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.840]   and most of all, I love finding a way to eat
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.060]   all the best foods a place has to offer.
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.200]   So I thought it'd be fun to introduce a new type of episode
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.960]   where I bring in a local expert in another country
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.640]   to share all the hacks for visiting their city.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.160]   I was originally gonna start with Japan
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.780]   because it just opened, I have the perfect person in mind,
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.480]   and it's probably my favorite travel destination in the world
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.800]   but that episode will be next
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.840]   because after my episode with Bill Perkins,
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.760]   which is amazing if you haven't checked it out,
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.000]   I started talking with Amy
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.500]   about how we could start optimizing
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.560]   for more net fulfillment in our lives.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.040]   And so we actually decided to book
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.120]   a last minute trip to London on less than two weeks notice
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.500]   and ended up getting a ridiculous deal with points,
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.600]   which I will talk about at the end of this episode.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.920]   So with a trip to London on the horizon,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.360]   I reached out to Jessica Dante,
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.200]   who not only has been living there for almost a decade,
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.280]   but runs the Love in London YouTube channel,
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.960]   which has over 20 million views
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.240]   and she knows so much about London.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.880]   We're gonna get into why you should visit,
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.280]   what you should do, what mistakes to avoid,
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.820]   and get all of Jess's secret spots to visit
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.600]   to have an incredible trip.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.320]   And then after talking to Jess,
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.360]   I'm gonna break down exactly how I booked my trip
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.440]   and give you an overview of the best way
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.360]   you can be using your points and your miles
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.480]   and even scoring some deals on a trip to London.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.980]   So let's get into it right after this.
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.400]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.920]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.160]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.540]   as you build your wealth.
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.840]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.680]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.840]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.360]   finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.360]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.760]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.720]   I've loved being a part of the community
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.040]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.160]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.520]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.240]   Now, the majority of Longangle members
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.040]   are first generation wealth,
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.120]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.260]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.600]   and learn from each other
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.200]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.480]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.820]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.240]   Like I said, I'm a member
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.400]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.360]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.840]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.280]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.640]   to your children's education,
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.940]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.400]   So many of these conversations
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.600]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.280]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.140]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.320]   I encourage you to check out Longangle
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.400]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.640]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.040]   And if you choose to apply,
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.000]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.060]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.800]   Jess, thank you for joining
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.360]   the first travel destination episode of all the hacks.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.280]   Amazing, thanks for having me.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   Really happy that London is the first.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.220]   I'm not gonna lie, I think I'm a little biased,
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.120]   but I think it's maybe the best in my opinion.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.960]   It depends on who you ask.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.800]   It's not just you.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.120]   So someone shared me this list from afar,
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.960]   the website and magazine afar.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.280]   There was the 10 best cities and London was number one.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.120]   And there was another study on the best cities
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.200]   and London was number one.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.280]   It just came out also for 2023.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.660]   And then I looked at travel and leisures,
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.440]   best destinations for 2023 and London's on that list.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.200]   So I was like, wow, so London's the number one city.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.000]   It wasn't even just to live or to travel.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.480]   It was just the number one city on two lists.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.080]   So I think I wanna ask you, why do you love London?
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.520]   What is it about London that makes it such an amazing city?
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.360]   Oh my gosh, well, there's so many things,
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.640]   but I think a couple of the top things are,
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   I love how diverse that the city is.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.920]   So that goes from the people that live here
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.160]   to the architecture, to the types of cuisines
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.980]   that you can try here.
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.520]   You just meet so many different people
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.160]   with so many different backgrounds.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.120]   You can eat so much amazing food.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.760]   And you can experience so many different things,
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.960]   no matter what your interest is or what your budget is.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.880]   There's just basically something for everyone,
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.240]   whether you live here or you just come to visit.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.160]   So I love that.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.640]   And as someone who works telling people
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.040]   what to do in London, I don't wanna ever get bored.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.860]   And I never will because there's so much to experience.
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.120]   It's always changing too.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.720]   So I'm gonna be here for like 30 years
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.960]   and there's still gonna be more for me to check out.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.200]   And I'll be like, I haven't been there yet.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.720]   Gotta go check that out and see if it's good or not.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.080]   - Is there something that sets it apart
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.080]   from other major metros that of course have diversity,
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.640]   have lots of restaurants, have lots of things to do?
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.800]   - Yeah, so I think London is a really interesting in-between
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.280]   in my opinion of like New York and the rest of Europe.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.160]   So I'm originally from New York.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.800]   I'm from Long Island, but I've spent time in New York.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.120]   Obviously I have friends who live there
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.160]   and New York City is go, go, go, right?
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.360]   Which I love, I love that energy.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.520]   And it's really intense.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.480]   And then very generally speaking,
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.440]   a lot of parts of mainland Europe are a lot more relaxed
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.680]   when it comes to working culture.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.440]   Basically all of the culture,
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.200]   it's seen as like a lot more relaxed and liberal.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.040]   Whereas London's kind of like in the middle.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.040]   So it's a really good balance for me.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.040]   And I think like a couple of good examples of that
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.980]   is our work-life balance is better here.
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.320]   So people are a bit better than say in New York
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.120]   about like actually leaving work at six o'clock,
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.800]   mainly 'cause people wanna get to the pub,
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.040]   which I'm totally down for.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.560]   I think that's a great motivation,
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.800]   if that's your motivation.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.680]   Something that's also really unique about London
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.000]   that as someone who lives here,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.280]   I really feel is like super important
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.040]   is that we have so much green space here.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.560]   So compared to my time in New York and other major cities,
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.920]   London's really spread out
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.480]   and you're really actually never that far
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.800]   from a beautiful public free green space that you can enjoy.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.960]   And I think that works actually for tourists as well.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.360]   And it's one of the beautiful things you can experience
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.920]   when you come to visit London too.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.800]   - So we have green spaces, we have going to a pub.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.680]   Are there a few other like top London experiences for you?
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.880]   Not for anyone else, just for you.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.160]   - Yeah, so I love Sunday roast.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.040]   Do you know what Sunday roast is?
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.860]   - No. - Okay.
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.600]   So it's a British tradition of,
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.760]   obviously it happens on Sundays where you go to the pub
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.060]   and on the menu only on Sundays,
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.120]   they have this special roast menu
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.960]   and you choose from different types of meat.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.860]   So it's usually chicken, pork, beef,
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.280]   and sometimes a couple other ones
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.080]   or loads of places do vegetarian,
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.880]   which is where I usually go for and also vegan.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.640]   And then basically from the Americans,
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.120]   I always kind of equate it to,
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.160]   they bring this plate out
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.080]   and it's not dissimilar to Thanksgiving food.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.720]   It's kind of like you can have Thanksgiving
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.840]   like every Sunday.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.480]   It's a plate that has roast vegetables on it.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.220]   There's really good potatoes.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.580]   They do gravy.
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.580]   There's this kind of like a pastry
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.460]   that's called Yorkshire pudding,
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.580]   which is like so yummy.
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.620]   And you use that to soak up the gravy.
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.940]   And sometimes there's cauliflower cheese.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.420]   And it's just like a really nice tradition
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.980]   where you gather up your family
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.220]   or you gather up your friends
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.700]   and you're like, let's go for a Sunday roast.
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.380]   And you just go to the local pub
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.100]   and sit and you eat Sunday roast.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.780]   And if you wanna have a pint of beer,
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.820]   you can do that too.
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.260]   So that's one of my favorite things.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.300]   I always tell people to make sure you get to a pub
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.640]   on a Sunday and experience that.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.200]   - What sounds like one thing that is uniquely London
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.560]   is that the pub is something
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.760]   that you could do with your family.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.760]   I'm thinking as someone flying overseas
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.180]   with a two-year-old and a six-month-old,
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.160]   I'm like, oh, you know,
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.780]   we're not really gonna have the same trip we used to.
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.620]   It sounds like in London,
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.000]   I could just go to the pub with my kids
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.840]   and we could have a beer.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.680]   - You can, yeah.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.560]   So pubs are very family-friendly,
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.840]   especially on the weekends.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.360]   They're not as friendly in very central London.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.960]   So around like the really main touristy areas.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.960]   But for example, one of my favorite areas
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.480]   that I tell people to go to for pub experience
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.600]   is Notting Hill.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.880]   And you'll always on a weekend go to the pubs
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.880]   in Notting Hill and see families there.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.220]   And they've got little kids, they've got teenagers,
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.940]   and it's like a family thing.
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.800]   Sometimes it's big groups of families that will go.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.600]   And it's very normal.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.920]   They cater to kids.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.720]   So it's like nothing out of the ordinary.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.680]   And it's a really nice daytime weekend experience
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.640]   for families.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.460]   - Awesome.
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.920]   So while I'm actually planning a trip to London,
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.800]   we've already booked flights and where we're staying,
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.320]   I'm gonna assume most people aren't.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.460]   So I wanna start this and just talk about
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.040]   all the awesome things there are to do,
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.160]   get people excited.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.880]   And then at the end, we can wrap up
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.000]   and talk about things like hotels, flights,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.440]   transportation, that kind of stuff.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.560]   What's the vibe of people in London?
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.640]   Is it easy to meet people?
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.480]   Are they friendly?
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.000]   What should we know about Londoners?
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.200]   - So Londoners are very nice,
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.240]   but we're a little bit more closed off
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.960]   when it comes to meeting quote unquote outsiders.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.040]   I think it comes from that everyone's just really busy
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.000]   and the British are just a tiny bit more closed off
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.200]   compared to the Americans,
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.360]   which everyone's a little bit more closed off
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.320]   that I think compared to us Americans, right?
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.760]   So that's not a hard feat.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.480]   That being said, if you do end up talking to somebody
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.800]   who lives in London, generally they will be very nice.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.920]   And if you, for example, need like help on the street
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.580]   and you can't figure out where the tube station is,
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.160]   you can stop somebody and they'll be like,
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.000]   "Yeah, yeah, no worries.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.400]   "It's just like down that way."
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.040]   Or they might even walk you.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.760]   But it is a little bit harder to meet people.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.300]   That does change though when alcohol is involved.
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.200]   It's much easier to make friends
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.400]   when everyone's had a couple of pints, so.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.400]   - Is there a type of person you think
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.720]   a trip to London is best for?
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.840]   Is it young, old, single, kids?
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.440]   - Ooh, I don't think so.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.100]   Because there is so much that you can do here,
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.240]   I think that everyone's basically covered.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.960]   I think people that come with kids,
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.200]   maybe it's a little bit harder
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.920]   because if you're trying to use public transportation,
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.960]   it is trickier if you've got a lot of stuff
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.320]   that you're carrying or if you've got strollers.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.960]   That is tricky because a lot of the tube stations
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.160]   don't have escalators or elevators.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.320]   So that's tricky.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.640]   That being said though, if you're staying pretty central
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.500]   and you've got kids,
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.560]   a lot of people end up just walking everywhere.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.400]   So maybe they'll do like an hour walk
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.600]   to get to the first area that they wanna go explore.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.520]   So it is doable.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.920]   And then you save money doing that too.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.860]   There is kind of something for everyone.
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.960]   And then you just kind of have to adjust
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.400]   based on your needs and your budget.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.860]   - That one, we just bought a super compact light stroller
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.440]   that's like one click pop on your shoulder,
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.680]   carry kid down the stairs.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.520]   - Perfect.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.780]   - So we are prepared for running around the city.
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.200]   We don't have one of these giant American bus strollers
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.400]   with us for this trip.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.960]   Is there a best time?
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.440]   And by all means, if I tell you I'm staying somewhere
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.760]   and you're like, that's the worst place to stay
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.320]   or that's the worst time of year to go,
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.400]   don't feel bad about offending me.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.840]   Like this is for everyone else.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.800]   But when would you say someone should plan their trip?
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.160]   - A lot of it will depend on what your budget is.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.000]   And again, not to be like,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.640]   every time of year is great to go.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.760]   But actually the beauty of London is that
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.000]   there's always gonna be a pro of a time
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   that you're gonna visit and there's gonna be a con.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.240]   So for example, you guys are coming very soon.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.600]   So that will be middle to end of December.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.240]   The pro is it's so festive here.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.080]   It is incredibly beautiful.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.200]   There's so many fun Christmasy things to do
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.240]   if that's what you're into.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.840]   There's also like lots of ice skating rinks
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.040]   and there's great shopping.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.920]   The downside of that is that it is cold, of course,
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.020]   and also it is very crowded.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.240]   So like what you guys probably are gonna wanna do
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.640]   is if you wanna do some of the major things
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.400]   like the free museums, like the Natural History Museum,
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.160]   for sure you'll wanna avoid weekends
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.480]   because it is right now just like absolutely rammed
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.400]   with people who come from outside of London,
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.800]   take the train in and take the kids to go do everything.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.080]   So every time a year has a pro and con.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.540]   If you come in January, it's really, really cold,
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.360]   but it's also the quietest time and also the cheapest time.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.840]   If you come in the summer, you're hopefully,
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.200]   fingers crossed, gonna get the best weather.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.760]   You're also gonna get the most sunlight
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.600]   'cause it stays light till almost 10 o'clock,
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.440]   which is really cool.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.880]   But also the prices are highest
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.260]   because it's peak travel season.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.120]   And again, you're gonna see those crowds.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.400]   And if you get a heat wave,
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.680]   we don't deal with heat waves very well here.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.480]   A lot of places do not have air cons.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.480]   So if that's something that you're considering,
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.080]   that would be really tricky for you,
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.520]   then that's probably not gonna be a good time
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.360]   for you to come.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.680]   And then shoulder seasons are always great
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.880]   'cause they've got the mix of the peak and the downtime.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.360]   - So if you wanna deal, avoid the summer.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.120]   I would say avoid Christmas, New Year's, holidays,
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.560]   but we're going like the two weeks before that.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.160]   And we got amazing deals because I think everyone's traveling
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.440]   in the States for Thanksgiving.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.480]   Everyone's traveling around Christmas, New Year's.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.680]   No one's really traveling the first few weeks of December.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.800]   So I think it's a great deal time.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.280]   We'll see how we fare on the weekends.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.480]   Maybe those are our park days
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.960]   to just kind of let the kids run wild.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.800]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.800]   - I have a friend who always was like,
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.920]   you know what, you can go to any city
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.000]   for any amount of time.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.760]   Is it crazy if you live in New York
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.000]   and it's seven hours to go for the weekend?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.040]   Is it crazy to go for a week, two weeks?
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.760]   At what point in time do you say,
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.480]   maybe if you're going that long,
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.520]   check out some other place for a few days?
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.520]   - Yeah, so you can do a weekend.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.280]   So when I first moved over here
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.160]   and I was working at a travel company,
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.040]   this travel company was selling to the British crowd
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.920]   these three day trips to New York.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.640]   And I was like, that is absurd.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.760]   Who would fly all the way to New York for three days?
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.720]   But it is doable.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.640]   It's actually not that far if you really think about it.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.560]   But it is quite a journey.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.280]   So I usually say at least a week
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.860]   is a really good amount of time
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.860]   because you can really dig into some of the areas,
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.580]   not just like the main tourist attractions,
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.340]   but you can also give yourself time
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.160]   and you don't have to feel like you're rushing around
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.000]   because you have three days to see
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.400]   whether it's all the main tourist attractions
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.480]   or you wanna see Shoreditch and you wanna do Notting Hill,
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.640]   but those are really far apart.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.000]   So you're probably not gonna do those in the same day.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.300]   Just gives you some time to take your time
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.680]   and also be a little bit more spontaneous.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.320]   For Love in London, we sell a three day itinerary.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.500]   That's our most popular thing.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.040]   And we also have a six day one,
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.160]   which has actually been really popular as well
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.120]   because most of my audience are people
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.300]   who are coming from the US.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.680]   So they are coming for usually more than three days.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.320]   But a week is a great amount of time.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.960]   And I usually say, if you wanna do day trips,
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.400]   I usually recommend not doing them
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.160]   if you have less than a week
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160]   because there's just so much you can do in London.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.880]   And again, if you're still feeling a bit jet lagged
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.360]   and you've come to London,
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.600]   you've been running, running, running
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.500]   for the first few days,
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.240]   and then you have to hop on a train one day
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.280]   and head out to Bath or Oxford or wherever you wanna go,
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.100]   that's great.
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.800]   But also you might wanna just slow it down a little bit.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.120]   In my opinion, I'm always trying to get people
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.360]   to just be like, okay, there's a lot to do
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.180]   and you can't do it all.
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.960]   So let's try to slow it down and leave some room
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.120]   for if you see a shop that you wanna go into
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.000]   and spend an hour in,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.480]   or you run past a cafe and you're like,
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.080]   let's just sit for an hour and have a nice coffee
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.680]   and just relax, then you can do that.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.400]   - So we're going for, I think six days.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.640]   We're not going anywhere else.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.740]   Our style of travel, though, to be clear,
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.680]   we haven't actually done this with kids,
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.400]   is much more like I wanna get the experience
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.520]   of being in London, living in London.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.320]   So if we miss some of the tourist destinations, that's fine.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.240]   Like London is so central to so many European trips
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.200]   that I'm sure we'll be back in the future.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.220]   So I think we're trying to go on the kind of trip
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.280]   you describe.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.040]   And I went through one of those itineraries you made
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.720]   and I was like, this is exactly what I want.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.360]   I would say maybe I was like, we have two kids,
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.680]   it's probably a little overkill for a two kid trip.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.620]   But some of those things we'll just skip.
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.640]   What about food?
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.440]   You said there's lots of cuisines from all over the world,
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.560]   but would you say London's like a foodie town for drinks?
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.120]   There's pubs, so is it more of a beer crowd?
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.760]   California seems like it's more wine
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.360]   and now cocktails in the city.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.560]   - Yeah, so everything, all of the above.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.040]   So London's amazing.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.720]   You can try any cuisine here from all over the world.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.880]   Something I do see that's a little bit of a mistake
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.440]   from tourists sometimes is that you come to London
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.040]   and you only just wanna have British food,
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.960]   which I'm not saying don't have British food.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.200]   Try fish and chips, bangers and mash, the pie,
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.880]   like totally do that if that's what you wanna do.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.160]   But there's also so many different cuisines,
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.320]   especially if you don't think
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.520]   you're ever gonna get to Malaysia,
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.760]   why don't you try like Malaysian food or Sri Lankan food?
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.160]   And you can really expand your palate
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.200]   and try cuisines that you might not ever get to try again
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.960]   if you're never gonna go to like a major metropolitan city.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.040]   We have a huge foodie scene here, same with drinks.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.080]   So pubs are huge, but also cocktail bars,
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.960]   we've got great wine bars.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.480]   There's drinking for the lower end of the budget
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.920]   and just like rowdy, like more fun, younger crowds.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.280]   Then there's also really fancy speakeasies
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.720]   and really like exclusive cocktail bars.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.920]   Anything you can want, we've got it here.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.200]   This is what's so cool about London
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.080]   is that anything that you want,
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.280]   you're gonna be able to find it.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.400]   You just kinda have to like do a little sifting.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.080]   - So we're gonna get into a lot of these things
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.600]   and I want some real recommendations.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.200]   But you said a mistake is eating just British food.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.480]   I feel like British food has a pretty terrible reputation.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.280]   So I'm like, man, if that's what you're coming to London for
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.680]   you're probably doing it wrong.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.480]   What other mistakes are people making
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.320]   when they're coming to London?
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.440]   - Well, I am gonna caveat that, what you just said actually.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.160]   So British food has gotten much better.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.800]   So you can do really well.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.200]   And if you do wanna have British food,
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.980]   I always say the best place is at pubs
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.200]   because most pubs will have restaurant sections
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.540]   and they'll have like classic pub menus
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.000]   or they'll be more of like a gastro pub
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.960]   and do a modern take on similar British dishes.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.840]   So it is good, but yeah,
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.320]   I just wanted to throw that in there.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.080]   But it's definitely the type of food
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.060]   that you'll get sick of after like eating it
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.880]   three times in a row, for sure, yeah.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.200]   - I watched a few of your videos and one of them was like,
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.640]   if it says it's like truly authentic pub, just like run away.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.000]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.880]   It's one of those things like if you have to say it,
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.280]   you probably aren't.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.720]   So something that I have been seeing with tourists recently
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.960]   is there's a lot of content around
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.120]   when you use public transportation here
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.840]   that you have to get an Oyster card.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.240]   An Oyster card is basically something that you can buy
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.280]   once you get here, where you add your money to it
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.640]   and you use it to tap in and out for the underground system
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.860]   or to use the buses.
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.320]   But then you have to keep topping it up.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.840]   You also have to pay seven pounds for each of the cards
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.320]   and it's non-refundable.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.400]   So instead, I'm just trying to tell people,
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.280]   you can actually use Apple Pay or Google Pay
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.080]   and you don't have to worry about doing the top up.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.200]   And also if you have any credit or debit cards
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.080]   that are contactless, you can use those too.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.080]   And it's much easier and quicker.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.800]   You don't have to wait in the queue to top it up
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.640]   at the station every time you run out of credit.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.360]   So that's something I see quite a lot.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.640]   I also see a lot of people who think
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:54.400]   that you have to spend a ton of money on their hotel
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.000]   to make sure that they're in like a safe area
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.400]   or they're just at a safe property.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.640]   And they end up sticking to some of the big
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.960]   US corporate brands, which is fine.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.800]   Like that's fine.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.920]   And I know everyone's got points and stuff.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.280]   So a lot of people are trying to stick to the Marriotts
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.240]   and this and that, blah, blah, blah.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.240]   That's completely fine.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:15.240]   But we have so many amazing, safe boutique hotel properties
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.160]   that are like so beautiful and interesting
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.280]   and they're small and they're in great areas too,
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.520]   even if they're not in very central London.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.800]   So I would say don't ever discount something
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.520]   that looks like it's a good deal
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.880]   if it just doesn't seem like it's a name
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.960]   that's recognizable to you or it's in an area
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.880]   that you don't necessarily recognize as like Covent Garden
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.160]   or Soho right in the center of London.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.960]   You could end up in a really amazing hotel
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.040]   and also in a cool area.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.200]   - Is there like a good rating site in the UK
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.760]   that's like, oh, I'm looking at this hotel.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.720]   Is it good?
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.360]   Like I don't personally put a lot of faith in TripAdvisor.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.000]   So I'm curious whether it's restaurants or hotels,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.040]   is there a thing?
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.880]   - So for hotels, I personally use booking.com.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.800]   I find that the ratings generally are on point.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.960]   And then obviously you can just book right through booking.com
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.840]   so it's really easy.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.480]   I don't really use TripAdvisor for anything actually anymore.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.640]   And then in terms of food,
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.480]   so we don't have like a Yelp here
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.520]   and TripAdvisor is generally tourists.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.400]   So I would say if you're looking for like
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   what locals think about food or a bar or something like that,
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.640]   probably like Google reviews, which are always,
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.560]   you never really know,
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.440]   but I think that's where like most Londoners would go
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.080]   if they're looking for reviews in a style
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.240]   that's a site like that with like actual reviews from people.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.960]   Otherwise we have websites like
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.080]   the Infatuation is really big here,
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.360]   Time Out, Love and London.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.320]   I don't know if you heard of it,
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.520]   but we talk about food and drink
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.680]   and all the things of course.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.840]   - You briefly said something about safety.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.520]   Is there dangerous parts of London?
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.000]   Should people be concerned at all?
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.520]   I had this one realization where
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.240]   I was reading this Lonely Planet book for New York for fun.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   I think someone we knew was traveling around the States
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.760]   and it was like, New York, make sure you get a money belt
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.400]   and you put all of your money in your money belt
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.240]   and tuck it in your pants.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.240]   And I was like, I've been to New York dozens of times.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.200]   It's never crossed my mind.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.800]   I've lived there, never been a thing.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.920]   Is everyone just always kind of scaring people?
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.920]   So what's the low down there?
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.240]   Are there places to avoid?
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.920]   Are there times a day to avoid?
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.160]   Is the tube rampant with pickpockets?
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.840]   - So there are areas in London that are,
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.640]   relatively speaking, not safe,
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.720]   but they're never where tourists are gonna end up.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.640]   So I always say like, don't worry about the area.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.800]   It's never a place that you would ever go.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.520]   So areas are completely fine.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.560]   In terms of pickpockets and things like that,
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.400]   just like you would in any other city,
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.040]   just keep your stuff close to you.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.680]   Don't have your phone waving around.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.600]   We do have a little bit of a problem at the moment
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.040]   of mopeds going by and grabbing phones out of hands.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.280]   So that's really the main thing.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.600]   But otherwise, just the same rules
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.480]   you would apply to any major city.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.040]   Don't have your pockets open.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.120]   Don't have anything in the back pocket
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.960]   where people can easily take it from you.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.360]   Keep everything zipped up, everything close to you.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.680]   Don't have any valuables out in plain sight.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.320]   But millions of people run around the city every day
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.920]   and have absolutely no problems.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.280]   So it's really nothing to be concerned about.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.920]   And I think in terms of safety at night,
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.640]   generally the only thing I would say
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.960]   is that women on their own.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.280]   So I usually like past 11 o'clock
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.800]   will get an Uber to get home.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.240]   But if I was with somebody else,
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.640]   then we're fine to be on public transport
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.000]   and to walk on our own.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.320]   People can interpret how they want to.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.160]   - So I wanna get a lay of the land.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.760]   And we could spend so long talking about,
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.000]   here's this neighbor, that neighbor.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.440]   But is there generally a way you break up the city
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.080]   and kind of group it into a few major areas?
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.520]   - Yeah, so basically the most popular area
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.480]   that tourists a lot of times only stay in
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.520]   is what's called Central London.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.240]   So this is like the really famous areas
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.840]   like Soho, Covent Garden, Marlabone,
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.000]   the South Bank, Westminster,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.200]   which is where Buckingham Palace,
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.440]   Houses of Parliament, all those places are.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.760]   And it includes a few other areas.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.960]   That's where the majority of the tourist attractions are.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.680]   And it is the dead center of London.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.920]   So that's where even Londoners will go there
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.560]   if we're meeting a friend for dinner
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.440]   and we both live on other parts of the city.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.200]   So that's where a lot of tourists
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.200]   end up doing a lot of stuff.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.360]   There's lots of good restaurants around there
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.520]   and bars and things like that.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.600]   You just have to know where you're going
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.000]   'cause there's also some really not so good stuff there.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.120]   It's like very tourist trappy and kind of gross.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.880]   It's those like authentic pub kind of places
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.000]   that you'll find there.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.040]   Basically the city's broken up into four major areas,
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.240]   simply North London, South London,
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.960]   East London, and West London.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.000]   And in each of those areas,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.080]   there's a few main areas that I would say
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.480]   that tourists are more likely to go to
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.960]   because there's things to do
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.720]   and it's not only just neighborhood-y.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.360]   There's good bars, good restaurants,
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.040]   parks, activities, things like that.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.120]   Personally for me, I live in East London.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.760]   That's my favorite part of the city.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.520]   There's just lots of stuff to do around here
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.640]   and it's fun and beautiful.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.160]   But then West London has Notting Hill
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.880]   and lots of great museums
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.960]   and really interesting things to do there.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.760]   And North and South also have their great things too.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.520]   As Londoners, we have this like really big divide
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.940]   of we self-identify if we're East or West London
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.360]   and we think the other side is terrible.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.520]   We don't know why people live there.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.720]   And then the same with North of the river,
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.520]   which is the River Thames or South of the river.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.400]   And there's this constant battle of
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.160]   why would you live on the other side?
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.160]   It's so boring there.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.600]   And it's just always been like that.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.800]   - Let's highlight a couple neighborhoods
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.480]   where you're like, these are just really cool spots.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.400]   Whether you stay there,
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.540]   you spend an afternoon or a morning there,
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:39.640]   what would you put on your list
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.200]   of three or four awesome neighborhoods in London?
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.320]   - Okay, so--
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.440]   - Not all in East London.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.880]   I know you think it's the coolest place ever.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.100]   - Okay, fine, fine.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.660]   So I've said Notting Hill a lot.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.460]   I think that's a really famous one.
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.340]   So I might not spend too much time on that.
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.820]   But Notting Hill is really beautiful area.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.020]   And it's one of the few areas of London
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.660]   where even though it's quite popular with tourists,
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:03.180]   it still has a really interesting local vibe
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.980]   where neighbors actually say hello to each other.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.780]   People pass by each other on the streets.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.860]   It's a really lovely community area.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.660]   And that's why the pub scene around there is so great.
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.000]   And that's why I always recommend people
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.300]   to go do pub hopping around there
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.300]   for like a nice relaxed afternoon.
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.460]   It's not like a crazy, let's get drunk pub kind of area.
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.780]   But if we skip on past Notting Hill,
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.140]   in North London, there's an area called Hampstead.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.380]   The main thing there is this park called Hampstead Heath.
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:33.220]   And it's this beautiful big park that has viewpoints.
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.060]   There's swimming ponds that people go to in the summer.
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.220]   There's Kenwood House.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.020]   Have you ever seen the movie Notting Hill, actually, Chris?
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.260]   - I'm not sure if I have.
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.100]   - Okay, okay.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.620]   - When you say it, I'm like,
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.420]   of course it's a movie, I remember it.
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.580]   But now I'm like, have I?
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:47.900]   I don't know.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:48.740]   - That's okay.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.740]   Well, if you do watch it,
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.460]   and I'm sure there will be people listening
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.300]   that have seen it,
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.500]   Kenwood House is featured in the movie
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.540]   in towards the end when she's filming this like
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.340]   Victorian film and Hugh Grant's like listening to her speak.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.580]   And it's a whole thing.
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.880]   You'll have to watch it at some point.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.180]   So the house that's featured in that is in Hampstead Heath.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.540]   So people like go to Hampstead Heath
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.780]   to see this beautiful Victorian house,
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.900]   which actually is also a little museum
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.460]   that has art and other things that you can see in there.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.660]   So that's a really good jumping off point.
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.060]   Really great to take kids there
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.220]   because they can run around, see the wildlife.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.700]   They can see people swimming.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.220]   They can go swimming, not right now,
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.060]   but a little too cold.
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:26.900]   - Probably not on this trip.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.220]   - Yeah, not this trip, not this trip.
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.740]   And then you can go into Hampstead Village,
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.020]   which has really great cafes, bars, restaurants,
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.540]   and it's super family friendly.
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.660]   It's also this really just beautiful area
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.820]   with like multi-million pound houses.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.300]   A lot of celebrities live around here,
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.260]   and there's a lot of historical value.
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.420]   So that's Hampstead.
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.580]   Yeah, and then, I mean, it's hard to pick
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.940]   'cause there's so many,
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.840]   and I love to kind of talk a little bit more
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.460]   about the areas that people don't go to as much.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.580]   Like if we go to South London,
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.620]   there's an area that's called Brixton.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.540]   Brixton is super diverse,
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.100]   has really great markets that have been around for ages,
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.460]   and they have vendors selling like all different types
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.500]   of wares, as well as there's little wine bars,
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.820]   there's little shops there.
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.180]   So Brixton is just a really cool, interesting area
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.020]   with lots of things to do down there.
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.740]   If you're gonna stay central though,
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.500]   there's an area that I really like going to
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.900]   that's called Seven Dials.
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.660]   So it's really close to Covent Garden,
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:29.180]   which is one of the most famous areas in Central to go.
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.840]   But Seven Dials is basically seven streets
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.060]   that converge onto each other,
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.820]   and there's a sundial in the middle of it.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.420]   That's obviously where the name comes from.
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.780]   And down these streets, there are,
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.940]   there's some not independent places,
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.780]   but there's also lots of great independent cafes
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.740]   and restaurants.
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.140]   There's a couple of pubs in the area,
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.900]   and there's a really great indoor food market
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.380]   called Seven Dials Food Market, which I highly recommend.
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.820]   And then there's also this hidden little courtyard
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.820]   that's called Neal's Yard, which you can go into.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.900]   It's the home of Neal's Yard Remedies,
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.700]   which is quite a famous skincare brand.
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:09.540]   And in there, you'll find this fantastic wine bar
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.700]   called CVS, and also one of my favorite restaurants
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.660]   in London called The Barberie.
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.060]   And now they have a new place next door
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.460]   called The Barberie next door,
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:22.220]   and they do food that's inspired by the Barberie Coast.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.100]   And it's so good, really, really good.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.080]   It's one of those ways I'm like,
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.320]   I don't really love telling people about this,
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.420]   but I don't want to gatekeep.
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.800]   So yeah, really yummy food there,
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.380]   but it's a really cute, colorful little courtyard.
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.460]   And so it looks really nice in photos as well.
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.780]   And you can sit there, have a glass of wine,
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.020]   have some food, have a coffee, it's great.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.660]   And then I am gonna circle over to East London.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:45.580]   It is my favorite.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.060]   There's an area called Shortage.
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.420]   This is probably the most popular area of East London.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.300]   And it is very eclectic.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.420]   It is the area that's the most popular for street art.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.720]   So if you are really interested in seeing street art,
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.900]   this is where you're gonna do it.
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.460]   You can either walk around on your own and easily find it,
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.100]   or there's loads of really affordable
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.500]   or free street art tours that you can do.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:12.500]   This is also where a lot of creative agencies are based,
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.300]   a lot of artistic agencies.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.500]   So a lot of the people that are in this area,
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.140]   even during the week, are very creative.
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.620]   So you always kind of feel that vibe while you're there.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.780]   And of course, you're gonna have good cafes,
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.980]   good coffee, fantastic restaurants.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.200]   I come to this area a lot to eat.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.100]   One of the restaurants that I love is called Bao,
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.900]   and they do Taiwanese bao buns.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.180]   And in Shortage, they have a noodle shop,
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.940]   which is really good.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.180]   So highly recommend going there.
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:44.780]   And for cafes, Attendant Cafe is really good.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.300]   They do really nice coffee.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.460]   And probably the most popular cafe around this area
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.100]   at the moment is a place called Jolene.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:57.500]   And there is basically always a line outside the door,
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.900]   especially on the weekends,
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.940]   but the coffee here is just fantastic.
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.700]   And they do great pastries as well.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.460]   So if you want coffee, that's a good spot to go.
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.100]   - I wish I could say that I'm eating
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.220]   a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.820]   but the reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.700]   So I love having an easy way
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.940]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.780]   which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens,
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.660]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:22.900]   for this episode.
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.920]   I started taking it because I wanted to see
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.220]   what all the hype was about,
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:29.340]   and I've kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.700]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.060]   add a few ice cubes.
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.860]   It tastes so good when it's cold,
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.060]   and I head to my office feeling focused
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.420]   and energized for the day,
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.180]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.580]   I also love that it's made from 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.100]   minerals, and superfoods,
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.860]   and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.320]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals,
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.020]   or artificial anything.
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.780]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.320]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.240]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.620]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.140]   All you have to do is visit
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.820]   allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.660]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.700]   to take ownership over your health
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.740]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.500]   So I am quite comfortable right now,
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.060]   which is actually true almost every day,
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.420]   and that's thanks to Viore,
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.340]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.520]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.400]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.760]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all,
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.520]   and it's so freaking comfortable,
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.320]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.540]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.400]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.640]   unless you're wearing Viore,
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.440]   in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.240]   And it's not just for men.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.040]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.680]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.160]   I think I have three pairs,
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.220]   and they are probably the most comfortable pants
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.280]   I've ever owned.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.180]   Their products can be used for just about any activity,
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.620]   whether it's running, training, or yoga.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.120]   They're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.040]   or their MetaPants can even work for a night out.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.080]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness,
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.580]   and for all the Hacks listeners,
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.360]   they are offering 20% off your first purchase,
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:20.200]   as well as free shipping and returns on US orders over $75.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.400]   So you should definitely check them out
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.560]   at allthehacks.com/viore,
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.400]   or in the link in the show notes.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:32.400]   Again, go to allthehacks.com/viore,
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.680]   and get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.600]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.000]   I kinda got a little bit of lay of the land.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Obviously, I'm gonna have to walk around.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.580]   You talked earlier about how you have
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.800]   these awesome itineraries.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.260]   So I've been going through the three-day,
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.600]   because I was like, "Well, I don't wanna plan too much,
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.280]   "so let's take the three-day, spread it out over six-day."
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.320]   What do you think things people should be
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.560]   really trying to do on their trip?
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.120]   I'm sure someone could find a list.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.600]   Best attractions in London.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.360]   We don't need to go through everything,
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.960]   but what are the highlights of an itinerary?
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.840]   - Of course, everybody wants to go see
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.280]   the Houses of Parliament, and Big Ben,
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.360]   and Westminster Bridge.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.140]   So I think do whatever the sites
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.760]   that you're really interested in,
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.240]   make sure you do them, because I get it.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.000]   You're in London, and you've seen these things on TV
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.220]   and in movies for years, so make sure you do that.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.860]   For me, I'm always trying to think of an interesting way
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.480]   to see something, so I think a good example is,
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.080]   everyone knows the Tower of London.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.200]   So the Tower of London, it's been around
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.600]   for like 1,000 years, and it's still in this place.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.120]   And you can go and have tours there.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.800]   They're very family-friendly.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.100]   But you can also do something that's quite interesting,
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.120]   which is called the Ceremony of the Keys.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.380]   And what this is, it's a tradition
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.960]   that's been happening for 700 years.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.400]   And they've done it every single day for 700 years,
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.880]   except I think there's one day during one of the wars
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.480]   that they had to stop doing it.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.400]   You got tickets for it, and you basically watch
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.880]   this tradition of where they exchange the keys
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.320]   when they're kind of like closing up the tower at night.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.440]   And it's never been recorded.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.680]   You're not allowed to film it.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.080]   You're not allowed to take pictures.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.640]   And I think it's a really interesting, different way
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.920]   to experience this really popular tourist attractions.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.560]   And it's very hard to get tickets,
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.000]   but it's definitely doable.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.580]   And the tickets are only five pounds,
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.280]   whereas it's usually, I think, about 25 pounds
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.500]   for adults to get in at normal times of the day.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.160]   So I think that's really cool.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.320]   In terms of viewpoints, so a lot of people
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.840]   like to do the London Eye, which that's cool.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.400]   The first time I ever came to London,
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.480]   I did the London Eye as well.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.040]   I thought it was great.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.360]   It is a bit of a steep price for the tickets.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.320]   So if you still wanna do some kind of viewpoint,
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.720]   but maybe you don't need to do the London Eye,
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.120]   you could go to this place called the Sky Garden,
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.740]   which is completely free to visit.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:52.400]   And it's actually higher up than the London Eye.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.560]   It's basically this garden in the sky.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.520]   You take a lift all the way up to the top of the building.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.400]   That's called the Walkie Talkie building,
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.040]   'cause it looks like a walkie talkie.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.920]   And there's all this plant life that you walk around,
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.940]   but there's also these amazing views
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.840]   over the London skyline.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.440]   It's pretty cool and a lot cheaper, obviously.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.680]   - I know you're like the spokesperson
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.280]   for London on YouTube in my mind,
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.400]   but don't be afraid to be like,
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.440]   "Dude, it's just not worth it."
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.520]   Don't waste your time there.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.000]   I know you've said that about Leicester Square, but...
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.740]   - Yeah, Leicester Square is for sure the number one thing
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.320]   that I'm like, "Avoid it at all costs."
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.040]   Like I even will walk around it
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.980]   if I'm just navigating to get somewhere else in the city.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.760]   Basically, Leicester Square is this part of central London
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:40.520]   where it's just lined with like McDonald's, Burger King.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.360]   There's a couple of casinos.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.880]   There's a couple of movie theaters.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.840]   There's the M&M store,
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.360]   which I have so much disdain for the M&M store.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.380]   I just don't understand.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.200]   And there's always such a line to get into it.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.240]   The Lego store.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.360]   For some reason, there's so much stuff out there
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.680]   saying to go see Leicester Square.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.000]   I'm like, "There's nothing here."
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.240]   It's not upkept very well.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.840]   And so I always say to avoid that.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.560]   And instead, you could actually go just one block over
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.600]   and you're in Chinatown, which is amazing.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.880]   We have a small Chinatown in London, but really good food.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.620]   There's some hidden bars there
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.960]   and just a really interesting place to walk around.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.040]   So I'm always like, "Skip Leicester Square."
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.940]   Instead, go to Chinatown, it's literally one block over.
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.300]   - Do you have a favorite hidden bar?
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.500]   - So in Chinatown, there's one that's called Opium
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.100]   and it's a green door that is unmarked
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.940]   and you go up the stairs and there's three different rooms
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:31.580]   and the cocktails are really good.
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.660]   They're like super unique and different
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.740]   and they're all like Oriental themed.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.340]   So super interesting.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.460]   And they serve food there as well,
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.420]   but the cocktails, go for the cocktails.
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.580]   Hard to pick a favorite hidden bar,
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.820]   but I actually went to a really good one last night
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.980]   called Nightjar.
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:49.740]   There's two different locations and it's Prohibition themed.
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.860]   So you go like down the stairs,
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.220]   the menu is like themed with different parts
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.660]   of the Prohibition and the war.
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:00.300]   And the servers are dressed up like they're old timey
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.580]   and the service is amazing and the cocktails are really cool.
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.660]   - And are these the kind of places
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.600]   where you need to make a reservation?
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.500]   How does that typically work?
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.260]   - Yes, especially recently, London,
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.420]   you have to make reservations to get into places,
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.680]   especially the ones that are quite popular,
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.380]   even if they are kind of under the radar,
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.660]   people still find out about them
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.820]   'cause Londoners love under the radar stuff.
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.980]   Anytime you can make a reservation,
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.900]   I highly, highly recommend it.
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.620]   'Cause also a lot of places in London are just very small,
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.460]   so they have very little covers.
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.500]   So if 10 people show up,
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.040]   that might cover the whole restaurant.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.180]   So anytime you can make a reservation for sure,
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:39.300]   or go very early or very late and you might be okay.
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.100]   - It's funny, I'm like such an optimizer
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.100]   and normally I'm like, okay,
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.720]   I'm gonna research all this stuff.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.300]   And then I was like looking through your three-day itinerary
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.580]   I was like, well, this is pretty good,
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:47.420]   you just put it together.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.500]   So for me, I was like,
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.020]   normally I would wanna go through all this
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.420]   and I was like, why don't we just use this?
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.940]   Like, why don't we just, this is our new playbook
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.180]   and save us a lot of time.
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.660]   So I appreciate that.
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.500]   Any other must-see things that people need to do
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.340]   when they're here for a short trip?
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.620]   I wanna see the city
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.940]   as it is normally seen by people who live here.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.380]   And I imagine you don't spend every weekend at the Tate.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.020]   - No, exactly.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.460]   And the thing is too,
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.280]   personally, my mindset for what I do is that
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.320]   there's not really any must-sees
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.000]   because it completely depends on what you're interested in.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.520]   So like some people might say,
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.240]   you have to go to the National Portrait Gallery,
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.520]   but if you're not into portrait art,
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.520]   even though it's free to go into,
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.880]   don't waste your time there.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.720]   Find art that you like or skip art altogether.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.360]   The Tate Modern's not gonna be interesting to you
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.840]   if you're not interested in modern art.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.240]   So I'm trying to give people like the permission.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.040]   Don't feel like you have to do something
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.860]   because someone has said like,
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.020]   you have to do the London Eye.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:44.860]   You don't have to.
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:45.860]   There's so many things you can do.
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.180]   Just do whatever's gonna work for you.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.100]   And also your budget
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.540]   because some of this stuff's really pricey.
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:53.380]   So if you're gonna take the four of you on the London Eye,
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:56.240]   that's gonna cost you like 100 pounds,
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.260]   then is that really gonna feel worth it
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:59.460]   if you weren't really that interested?
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.420]   - Are there deals for some of these things
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.780]   that I should know about going in,
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.740]   like book it in advance or buy it from this guy
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.660]   who works down this alley in the street?
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.720]   - Oh yeah, definitely.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.100]   If you wanna do like the main attractions,
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.340]   I always tell people to look into the London Pass,
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.780]   which is, it's got like 150
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.740]   of the biggest attractions on this pass.
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:21.100]   And you get a two day pass, a three day pass,
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.140]   a six day pass, whatever you choose.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.620]   And the tickets are included in the price that you pay.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.500]   And if it works with what you wanna see,
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.380]   you can save a lot of money with that.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.240]   You just have to plan and do some math
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.400]   to make sure that it all adds up.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.060]   Because if you're mostly wanting to see stuff
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.340]   that has low ticket prices,
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:41.700]   then it's probably not gonna be worth it.
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.020]   But if you're going to the big things
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.700]   with big ticket prices, it does end up saving,
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.380]   especially if you've got four of you, five of you,
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.180]   'cause they have kids passes as well.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:53.040]   It actually can end up saving you like hundreds of dollars.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.260]   It's actually kind of crazy.
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.920]   So the London Pass, we do have something on our website
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.860]   where it helps people understand
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.100]   if it's gonna work for them or not before they buy it.
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.700]   So if you just Google London Pass on our site,
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.540]   that's helpful.
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.940]   - I'll link to that page on the show notes.
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:06.780]   - Perfect.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.260]   So on the timeline of the Sunday roast
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:09.220]   that we were talking about,
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:13.340]   another British tradition here is called afternoon tea.
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.780]   And I personally love afternoon tea.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.820]   It's mostly hotels that will put on afternoon tea.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.700]   Some restaurants do it as well.
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.160]   Around like one o'clock, two o'clock,
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.180]   you'll go to this hotel that you've booked
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.500]   and they bring out your selection of tea.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.620]   You get to choose if you want tea or coffee.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:29.900]   If you go really high end,
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.100]   they'll have like extra special tea
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:36.180]   that's been flown in from Sri Lanka or India or wherever.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.300]   It's like really a beautiful experience.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:42.780]   And then you get a bunch of different types of treats.
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.500]   So we'll start with little finger sandwiches
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.940]   of various variety of different kinds.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.420]   Then you'll also get scones, which, oh, I love scones.
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.420]   Scones kind of resemble crumpets,
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.300]   but they're a lot nicer than crumpets in my opinion.
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.980]   And you eat those with jam and cream.
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:03.980]   And then the final tier is the sweet treats.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.220]   So the really nice places, this is where like they shine.
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:10.580]   They do these little pieces of artwork
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:14.540]   that you eat for your lunch/breakfast,
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.020]   whatever time you ended up going.
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.460]   And it's a really lovely experience.
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.700]   A lot of people in London will do it
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.700]   as like a special occasion for someone's birthday
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.740]   or for bridal showers and things like that.
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.940]   It's very British and it's lovely.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:27.900]   It's really lovely.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.820]   One of the places that I always recommend
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.260]   if you want like a very classic,
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:35.340]   traditional afternoon tea experience is Fortnum & Mason,
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:37.300]   which is a department store.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.340]   And they've got a beautiful tea room,
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:41.340]   which I think the queen actually opened it up
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.180]   if I remember correctly.
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.900]   Yeah, it's very classic.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.900]   They've got like the classical music playing.
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.380]   Somebody's playing piano.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.700]   You can get champagne if you want champagne.
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.980]   So I recommend either there,
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.940]   or if you want something really special with amazing views,
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.860]   there is the Shard,
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.420]   which is the tallest building in Western Europe.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.820]   And there's the Shangri-La Hotel,
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:03.860]   which is in the Shard.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.500]   And their restaurant Ting does a sky high afternoon tea,
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.580]   which they like pull out all the stops.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.700]   It's an amazing experience.
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.620]   - This is also something that as we did some research,
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.180]   it's like not everywhere,
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.100]   but many places are pretty kid-friendly
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.180]   and even sometimes like kid themed.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:20.700]   So it looked pretty cool
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.380]   as something we could do with the kids.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.380]   - Also, if you want another recommendation
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.580]   for a kid-friendly tea at the One Aldwych Hotel,
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:31.500]   they do a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory themed tea,
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.300]   which is really great for the adults as well,
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.740]   but the kids love it too.
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.980]   So it's like really cute.
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.420]   - So I have a random question,
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:40.700]   but very specific to tea.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.700]   So we looked at this one.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.100]   It seems like make reservations for most of these places,
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.380]   but I was looking at the menu
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.700]   and I guess either it's an entire meal.
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.820]   It looks like it's enough food
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.940]   that like you're skipping lunch that day.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.820]   Or I was like, well, our daughter usually naps.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.420]   So like one, what if we went at three o'clock?
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:57.220]   I don't want to ruin dinner.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.980]   Would it be poor form to go
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:01.300]   and just get like one or two for four people?
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.980]   Or do you need to order one for every person?
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.460]   - It's a bit different with kids.
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:05.980]   If you've got like really little ones,
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.540]   then you don't have to order ones for them,
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:08.820]   obviously, if they're not going to eat it,
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.900]   but you usually do order one for each person.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:12.860]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.180]   - I was looking for like a little deal.
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.220]   I was like, if we just want a little snack here and there.
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:17.060]   - I know.
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:18.020]   Well, the kids' ones are cheaper.
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.580]   So they're like significantly cheaper.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:20.420]   So that's good.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.060]   But actually a lot of people ask me that.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.500]   So that's a good question.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.380]   - Whenever my wife and I do like a tasting menu,
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.500]   we're like, can we just do wine for one of us?
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.340]   Because like, we don't need six glasses of wine.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:31.460]   So we'll just do the tasty menu with wine.
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.700]   And one person doesn't do the wine,
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:33.540]   but then we just share it.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.020]   So little things like that.
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:37.020]   Afternoon tea, any other cool experiences?
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:40.380]   Even if they're small, like I'll say in New York City,
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.780]   one of my favorite things to tell people to do is,
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.460]   if you're downtown, take the six train
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:48.460]   at the end of the line and just ride it south
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:50.260]   till it turns around and comes back north.
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:52.060]   And you loop through City Hall Station,
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.580]   which is a closed station.
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.460]   It's like many, many years old.
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.300]   It's really cool.
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.940]   It was like the shining star of the subway system,
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:43:59.780]   but it's not open.
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.180]   And you can like once or twice a year get a tour there.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.940]   But if you just ride the six train,
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.500]   it actually says, I think it's Brooklyn Bridge.
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.740]   It's like, you're on a downtown six train,
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.800]   next stop, Brooklyn Bridge, uptown.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.220]   And you could like ride this cool loop.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.820]   There's always these like kind of cool, random, weird things
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.100]   that would never make an average tourist list.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.580]   In San Francisco, there was this thing
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:20.980]   for anyone who did it, you'll know exactly what I mean.
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:23.460]   Unfortunately, it's closed, called the Jejune Institute.
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.700]   And you like went to this office building,
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.260]   and you just went up to the 30th floor,
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.940]   you knocked on a door, the door opened,
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.420]   you went into a room and you like watched a weird video,
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:32.460]   and there was an envelope,
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.060]   and then you would go on like a scavenger hunt.
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:36.140]   And I'm like, I have no idea how this works.
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.580]   Like you put a $20 in a slot, but there were no people.
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:39.420]   It was the weirdest thing.
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.500]   It wasn't an escape room, 'cause there was no escaping,
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.140]   but it kind of had that vibe.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.780]   And it was the coolest thing ever,
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.300]   but not on any tourist guide.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.220]   So any of those kind of like cool experiences
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.260]   that you might do on the weekends with friends,
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.860]   that would maybe it would make one of your guides,
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.740]   but it's definitely not in the average guide.
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.060]   - Okay, so I'll give you two,
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.260]   'cause I'll give you a little one,
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.460]   but then let me give you a bit of a bigger one
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.900]   that you can spend an afternoon.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:05.300]   So there is this area in London called Bermondsey,
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.220]   and running through Bermondsey,
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.180]   because it's very close to London Bridge Station,
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.060]   which is one of the biggest stations in London.
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:14.060]   There are elevated railway tracks,
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:16.060]   and then underneath the railway tracks
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:19.180]   are businesses that are in the arches.
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.380]   Because they're small spaces,
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.860]   they're all very small businesses that are very independent.
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:28.300]   And in one specific area of Bermondsey under these arches,
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:32.820]   it all happens to be breweries and gin distilleries.
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.900]   And so this thing has come about
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.660]   where it's like the unofficial name for it
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.900]   is called the Bermondsey Beer Mile.
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.940]   And on Saturdays, these breweries open up
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.260]   and they let people come in and do tastings
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.100]   or just get a pint or try the gin.
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.220]   What people do is they make a Saturday of it
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.540]   and they hop around to all the different distilleries
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.380]   and breweries and try all the different drinks.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.620]   And it can get a little bit messy, obviously,
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.060]   depending on how quickly you do it.
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.920]   You can also pair that with a visit to Maltby Street Market,
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.460]   which is literally right there.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:07.660]   And you can get food,
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:10.560]   and they have really good independent food.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.900]   They have probably the most diverse food vendors
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.620]   of all the markets in London.
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.100]   I love doing that Bermondsey Beer Mile.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:18.940]   It's really fun.
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:21.060]   And I feel like it gets skipped over so much
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.460]   because there's no official website for it.
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.140]   There's someone who's made an unofficial one,
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.380]   but it's pretty easy to find.
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:29.200]   You just navigate to Maltby Street Market,
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.340]   and then you'll see all of the breweries and distilleries.
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.780]   I love recommending that.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.900]   But I don't think that many people take me up on it, sadly,
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.380]   but it's almost good though, so it's fine.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.340]   - I don't know if we'll do the full drinking mile,
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:43.540]   but I'm like a sucker for street food, food market,
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:44.380]   anything like that.
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.500]   Favorite stall?
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.460]   - I mean, I had an amazing banh mi sandwich.
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:49.340]   So Vietnamese.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:50.740]   I don't remember the name of the stall.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.960]   They do kind of change them out sometimes too,
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.320]   which is nice 'cause then everyone can try different things.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.020]   But I think probably that banh mi
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:59.500]   is a favorite I've had so far.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.340]   - Okay. - It's good.
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.160]   - I will look for it.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.140]   - And then just for a little fun, a smaller one too.
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.540]   We were talking about Shoreditch before,
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.320]   and I mentioned that it's the most famous area in London
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.160]   for street art.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.140]   So if you wanna go street art spotting, you can do that.
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.300]   A fun little thing you can do while you're doing that
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:17.300]   is there's a bunch of tiny 3D broccolis
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.660]   scattered around the Brick Lane area.
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:24.420]   So you can go and spot all of the little broccolis.
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:26.420]   And the broccolis were put there,
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:28.220]   I think it was about 15 years ago,
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.900]   by this artist, Adrian Boswell.
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.300]   And he actually has a gallery there,
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.000]   and like broccolis are his thing.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.300]   So you can end up spotting all the broccolis
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.580]   and then go to his gallery
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:39.260]   and see what the deal is in there too.
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.540]   So that's kind of a fun thing.
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.940]   But it's one of those things where I had never noticed that.
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:45.100]   And then a couple of years ago,
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.700]   somebody pointed it out to me and I was like,
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:47.900]   "Oh my God, that's so cool."
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:49.180]   In all of my research,
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.260]   I've never heard anyone talk about that before.
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.780]   - I feel like my daughter would love a walk around
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:54.620]   looking for broccolis.
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:55.500]   So that's a great one.
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.340]   - Perfect.
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.260]   And they're like colorful.
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:58.980]   And so yeah, they're great for kids too.
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.140]   - We're talking about food a lot.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.420]   And it just happens to be noon in San Francisco.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:03.480]   So I'm already getting hungry.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:07.980]   But I think the reason that we travel is often for food.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.600]   So one of the challenges is it's so easy
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.460]   if you're going to Malaysia,
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.380]   I know the kind of food I wanna go get.
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:14.940]   But when I think of London, it's like,
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:16.940]   I've been told the best Indian food in the world
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:18.400]   outside of India is in London.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.020]   So we're like, "Okay, we got a little list there."
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:21.820]   I don't even know how to ask this question.
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.180]   Like, where should we be eating?
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.140]   Like, there's just so many options.
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.920]   Are there a couple cuisines or a couple restaurants?
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.800]   I'm sure you could have a list of a thousand.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.620]   I'm sure the itinerary I was looking at
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.420]   probably has the list of a thousand.
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:36.060]   But what are just a few restaurants that are must go to?
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:37.260]   They don't have to be the most popular.
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.940]   They don't have to be the most expensive.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.020]   Ideally, they're not the ones that you have to plan
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.260]   two months in advance to get a table.
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:46.860]   This is a hard one because there's just so many good places.
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.740]   Also, I think what's interesting about London,
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.700]   in my personal opinion, is that you don't have to
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.140]   spend a lot of money to have a really,
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:56.420]   really good food experience.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.620]   I actually find that the mid-range restaurants
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:00.680]   are my favorites.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.700]   We did talk about a couple of them that I love already.
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.020]   So we did the Barbary, we talked about Bao.
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.620]   There's an Italian that's called Campagna and Jones,
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:12.700]   and it's in a tiny little place off of Columbia Road,
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.220]   which this is East London, and Columbia Road
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:18.140]   is quite famous for being this very beautiful,
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:21.460]   picturesque street that has all independent shops on it.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:24.280]   And on Sundays, it has a world-famous flower market,
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.700]   which people love to go visit.
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.700]   You can pick up flowers, or you can just walk around
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.780]   and see the chaos that kind of ensues with it.
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:31.660]   It's very fun.
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:34.140]   So just off of that is Campagna and Jones,
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:37.100]   and they do regional Italian dishes
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:39.220]   from Campagna, obviously.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.420]   And the food here is amazing.
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.440]   It can be tricky to get reservations,
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:46.580]   but if you can do a weekday and do it like five o'clock
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:50.060]   when they open, or do a later one, like 9.30,
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:51.560]   then it is doable.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.060]   If anyone does end up going there,
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.860]   there's a starter that's called Gnudi,
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:57.100]   and it comes with sage butter.
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:59.180]   It was like one of the best things I've ever had.
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:00.100]   It's so nice.
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:00.940]   It's really good.
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.260]   I was with friends and we were eating it,
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.300]   and we all just stopped talking,
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:05.420]   which is a lot for me and my friends,
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.340]   'cause we were all just like, "Oh my God, this is amazing."
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.180]   It's kind of like Italian dumplings.
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:10.020]   So good.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.580]   So I love Indian.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.100]   I also love Sri Lankan.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:14.700]   I have been to Sri Lanka before,
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.420]   and my interest just has been piqued.
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:19.380]   And we have some really good Sri Lankan restaurants here.
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.060]   One of my favorites is called Paradise,
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.820]   and it's right in Soho, so it's very central London.
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.180]   It's a modern take on Sri Lankan food.
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:29.460]   So they do really great small dishes.
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:32.300]   You just order a bunch of them and everybody shares.
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:35.700]   They do this chickpea curry, which is so good.
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.060]   And they do amazing cocktails as well.
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.240]   All the good places you do have to reserve.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.220]   That's just kind of how it is.
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.060]   But I did the other day go there
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:45.020]   and managed to only a couple of days ahead
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:47.460]   get a 5.30 booking for four people.
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.860]   So it is doable.
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:50.740]   Go on a Monday or a Tuesday if you can,
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:53.420]   and go early, and that works well.
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.300]   And then finally, I'm gonna give one more Italian.
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.980]   - Give one more Indian, 'cause I just want one Indian.
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:57.820]   - One more Indian.
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:02.020]   So Dishoom is the most popular Indian place in London.
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:04.960]   It's a little bit more of a modern take on Indian.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.460]   They've got four or five locations now.
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:10.540]   Obviously, I can't speak to how incredibly authentic it is,
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.980]   'cause I am not from India.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:13.660]   But it's really popular
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:16.620]   because they do really, really good food
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:18.120]   at affordable prices.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.500]   The staff are amazing.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:23.580]   And the decor, it's supposed to be kind of like
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.820]   a small restaurant that you might see in Bombay.
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.540]   So the decor is really interesting.
[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:30.940]   And kid-friendly, works for everyone.
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:33.700]   It's one of my favorite places to go for breakfast.
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:34.540]   - Ooh. - Yeah.
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:35.860]   They do really good breakfast. - I don't think I've had it.
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:38.060]   I mean, I've been to India, so I've had Indian breakfast.
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:41.300]   But I don't know if I've had like a westernized version
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:42.260]   of an Indian breakfast.
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:43.540]   - It's a British version.
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.940]   They kind of like combine Indian food
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.940]   with what would be considered like a British breakfast.
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:50.020]   But it's really good.
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:52.840]   And that's also if you struggle to get in,
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:54.820]   because they don't really take reservations
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:57.520]   at most of the locations, especially for dinner.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.420]   So either try to reserve for lunch,
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:02.520]   or go for breakfast if you can't get for lunch either.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.260]   But some of the locations have really long lines,
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.340]   and people wait like an hour and a half.
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:10.140]   I don't really think you should do that for anything,
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:11.020]   in my opinion.
[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:12.480]   There's ways we can get around that.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.300]   So try to reserve at lunchtime,
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.660]   go during the week at lunchtime, or go for breakfast.
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:18.980]   - Are walk-ins a thing?
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:20.380]   In a lot of Japan, it's like,
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:21.500]   "No, we fully book our tables.
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.360]   "You can't necessarily walk in."
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.740]   What about for us, who have two young kids,
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:28.500]   and like eating dinner at five o'clock is the norm?
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:29.340]   - That's doable.
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:31.060]   So we have a really big range.
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.860]   So some places will be reservations,
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:35.580]   and if they're booked up, they're booked up.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.420]   Some places will have a mix of,
[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:40.020]   they'll reserve half of it for walk-ins,
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.580]   and half of it for reservations.
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:43.820]   And then some places are walk-ins only.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.120]   And for every budget, that varies.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.220]   So it's not like if it's a budget restaurant,
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:49.320]   it's always walk-in.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.100]   They sometimes will do reservations as well.
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.980]   If you're trying to find something
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:55.420]   that's like an easy walk-in,
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:57.680]   and you're kind of like, "We've had a long day.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.420]   "I don't want to do too much research."
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.700]   Pizza is really good here.
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:03.180]   There's a lot of places that do good Italian pizza
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:06.060]   for very affordable, and they do kids menus as well.
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:09.180]   Like there's Pizza Pilgrims and Franco Manca.
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:10.780]   Those are two different places.
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:12.380]   They're fantastic, really easy.
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:14.220]   You'll be able to get in, no problem.
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.420]   - And you had one more Italian.
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:16.640]   - Oh yes, I went here last night.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.380]   So it's fresh on the mind right now.
[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:21.360]   And it's in the guides as well, so you'll see it in there.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.860]   So it's called Padella,
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:26.180]   and they do basically simple pasta dishes.
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:29.140]   And the word Padella comes from the Italian word
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:31.860]   that is, I forget exactly what the Italian word is,
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.460]   but it's how they actually make the pasta here,
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:36.320]   which is they finish it off in a pan.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.900]   Very simple, but really, really good, and also affordable.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.300]   This is a walk-in place, which if you go at 5.30,
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.980]   you're golden, you will be able to get in, no problem.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.380]   Otherwise, people queue up,
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:49.540]   or they have like a queuing system
[00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:51.620]   where they can text you when your table's ready.
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:55.260]   If you go to Padella, my recommendations are
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.700]   to start with the burrata and order bread on the side,
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:01.020]   'cause the burrata there is so beautiful.
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.660]   And then I always order the cacio e pepe.
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:07.500]   It's the best cacio e pepe I've had in London.
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:10.180]   It's not too cheesy, it's just really nice.
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.100]   So those are always my recommendations,
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:13.380]   and I love going there.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:14.300]   - This is awesome.
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:15.980]   What about just general dining etiquette?
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:17.680]   Are meals slow, are meals fast?
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:18.900]   Is there something you need to know
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.140]   to get the attention of the wait staff,
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:22.540]   tipping, all this stuff?
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:25.020]   - So things are generally a bit slower
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.460]   than say if we're comparing to the US.
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:29.700]   Also, every place is very understaffed right now.
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:34.300]   So just kind of pack your patience pants when you come,
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:36.740]   because, I mean, Chris, you're coming very soon,
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:38.540]   and it's a very, very busy time of year.
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:40.460]   So things are just generally slower,
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:41.940]   but it's probably gonna continue like that
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.300]   for the next year or so.
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.580]   Patience, definitely.
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:48.200]   So you probably will have to ask for the server,
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.700]   unless you're in a more high-end place,
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.660]   but you might have to a few times raise your hand
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:52.900]   and be like, "Can we get some more water?
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:53.740]   "Can we get this?"
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:54.560]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.460]   And you definitely will have to ask for the bill.
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:58.740]   And then do you want me to go through tipping
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:54:59.580]   for restaurants?
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.220]   - Wherever it applies, beyond restaurants.
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:03.060]   - Okay, perfect.
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:05.400]   So for restaurants in London,
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:08.020]   generally what happens is you will get the bill,
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:10.820]   and on the bill it will say optional service charge.
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:14.660]   And that's generally 12.5% that's been added onto your bill.
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.360]   If you've had really bad service,
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.500]   you can ask for that to be removed.
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.960]   Generally, people just end up paying it,
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.500]   even if they weren't super happy.
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:25.500]   But once you've paid that service charge,
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.900]   you don't have to tip anything additional on top of that.
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.780]   And that service charge usually gets distributed
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:32.300]   between front of house and back of house.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.300]   So it doesn't only go to your server,
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:35.940]   it just gets put into the pool,
[00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:37.840]   and it goes to people in the kitchen as well.
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:40.240]   In terms of tipping for other things,
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.280]   we're not a huge tipping culture here.
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.780]   If you're at the hotel
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:46.020]   and your bags have been carried for you,
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:49.440]   you could tip, but you won't make anyone upset if you don't.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.340]   But of course, no one's gonna be upset
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:52.780]   about some extra money.
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:54.700]   For taxis and things like that,
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:57.020]   you can round up to the next pound,
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:58.340]   or if you had someone who was really great
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:00.380]   and you had a long journey from the airport or something,
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:02.140]   you can give an extra couple of pounds.
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:04.740]   But it's not extremely expected.
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:06.500]   I'm in my very British mode now.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.420]   What else do people usually tip on?
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:09.740]   (laughs)
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:11.100]   - I don't know, you'd get a drink at a bar,
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.140]   or you leave a couple bucks. - Oh, yes, okay.
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:16.900]   So if you go up to the bar and you're ordering yourself,
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:18.920]   so someone's not come to your table,
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:20.700]   then you do not have to tip.
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:24.180]   You can, so sometimes people will leave a pound coin,
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:26.780]   sometimes a bar will have a jar
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:27.900]   where you can leave tips.
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.700]   There's also this thing where you can say,
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.940]   "Oh, can I buy you one as well?" to the bartender,
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:36.540]   and then they will basically charge you for another drink,
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:39.460]   and then that money will go into a pot
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.260]   for everyone at the end of the night.
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.380]   Sometimes it's a little bit dodgy
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:44.260]   if they actually get that, so if you do wanna tip,
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:46.500]   I would just say, "Leave a pound coin or two,"
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:48.920]   and that's gonna be the best option.
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.020]   But you don't have to.
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.740]   I never tip at the bar.
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.580]   Occasionally, if I've had someone really good,
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:55.780]   I'll pop something into, if they have a tip jar.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:58.500]   But it's definitely for sure not expected at all,
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.860]   and there will be no service charge added onto your bill
[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:03.100]   if you order at the bar.
[00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:04.580]   If you got table service,
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:06.860]   then service charge will probably be added,
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:09.940]   and if it's not, then you can leave around 10%
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:11.020]   if you'd like.
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:13.440]   - So while we're on the topic of drinking at a bar,
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.140]   it might not be as relevant to our trip,
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:17.640]   but I wanna talk a little bit about nightlife,
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.380]   because I feel like London is well-known for it.
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:22.580]   Let's talk about what people should be doing at night
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:24.060]   who aren't in the situation we are
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:25.620]   with two kids, two and under.
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:26.580]   What's nightlife like?
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:27.420]   Where should people go?
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:29.060]   What should people be doing?
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:32.260]   - So the biggest areas for nightlife in London
[00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:35.100]   are generally Soho and Shoreditch.
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:38.280]   So Soho's the very center of London.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.580]   It's very eclectic.
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:43.440]   It's also where the majority of the LGBTQ+ clubs
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.140]   and bars are, so anyone who's looking for that,
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:48.420]   Soho is your place for that.
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:51.740]   And then Shoreditch is a little bit more artsy-ish,
[00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:54.260]   but also very popular for all different types of people
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:55.380]   who wanna go out.
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:58.740]   Both areas have both cheap and cheerful drinking.
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:00.780]   That's very rowdy and crowded.
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:04.040]   They've got the cocktail bars, wine bars,
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:06.580]   and then both also have clubs.
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:08.940]   Not gonna lie, clubs are not really my thing anymore,
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:11.100]   but I can give a couple of recommendations
[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:12.120]   off the top of my head.
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:15.340]   So in Soho, there's a club called Freedom,
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.660]   which is quite popular.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.860]   They've got a pretty standard upstairs,
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:19.900]   and then down in the basement,
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.540]   they've got DJs and a dance floor.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.540]   And then for Shoreditch,
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:26.980]   we had a really famous place there that just got shut,
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.520]   but actually, you can just walk around
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.500]   and follow the crowds and hear the music,
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.100]   and then you can find places that way.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.540]   So it's pretty easy.
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:36.480]   - Awesome.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.340]   And then what time do things close?
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:40.060]   Does transportation still run?
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:43.620]   - Transportation generally stops at midnight
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:44.840]   when we talk about the tube.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:48.520]   If you are out past midnight, there are a couple of options.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:49.940]   There are night buses.
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:51.640]   They have an N in front of the number,
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:54.500]   and so if you're using CityMapper or Google Maps
[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:56.580]   and you're trying to get back to your hotel,
[00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:59.540]   you might see N87, and that will be a night bus,
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:00.860]   and those run all night.
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.180]   There are also some night tubes,
[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:06.540]   which run all night as well on Friday and Saturday nights.
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:09.080]   So Google Maps might be like, oh, go on this line,
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.700]   and that's because it's running all night.
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:13.020]   Both of those are generally pretty safe options,
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:15.340]   but also, of course, you can get taxis.
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.460]   So you can either use Uber or FreeNow
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:18.980]   if you wanna call a taxi,
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:21.000]   or if you see a Black Cab,
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.160]   which we're quite famous for our Black Cabs here,
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.840]   and it's got a light on,
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.000]   that means that it's free and available,
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.440]   so you can put your hand out and call it,
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.080]   and they'll pull over and take you.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.120]   - Do one of those apps also call,
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:32.960]   like if you're like,
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.520]   I wanna take the London Black Cab experience,
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:36.480]   which I've heard actually for kids is easy
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.560]   'cause you could roll a stroller in and set it down,
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:39.800]   and it's not so crazy.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:43.860]   - Yes, both Uber and FreeNow call Black Cabs.
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:46.200]   I know Uber does, I'm pretty sure FreeNow does,
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:47.960]   and yes, I 100% agree.
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.740]   Also, anybody who might be traveling
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:51.500]   with someone with a wheelchair,
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:53.340]   the Black Cabs are the best option
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:54.580]   because the seats fold up
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:55.940]   so they can accommodate wheelchairs.
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:57.340]   So wheelchairs, buggies,
[00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:59.900]   which is the British term strollers, things like that.
[00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.780]   Also, if you just have a lot of bags, too,
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:03.060]   they're best for that.
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:06.620]   And then in terms of when the actual nightlife closes,
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:09.180]   so generally, pubs will only stay open
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.300]   'til about 11, 11.30.
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.860]   Bars will stay open 'til about 2, 2.30,
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.380]   and then the clubs, a lot of them shut at four,
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:19.040]   but also a lot of them go a lot later than four.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.760]   So depending on which one you decide to go to.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:22.860]   (laughs)
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.600]   - I can assure you that I am more likely
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.400]   to be waking up at four than still awake at four.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.520]   - Same. - So that makes sense.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.200]   I feel like we're planning on doing
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.160]   a lot more public transit than taxis.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.960]   What about the airport getting in?
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.040]   Any tips there?
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.560]   - We do have six different airports here in London.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.080]   Most people who are flying from the US
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.400]   or just doing the big, long-haul flights
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.800]   will fly probably into Heathrow Airport.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:48.320]   That's our main airport and our biggest one.
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.640]   That is technically still kind of London,
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.740]   but it's actually not really.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.160]   So it is quite far west of the city,
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.260]   but it's very easy to get into central.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.760]   Of course, you can take a taxi or an Uber if you want to,
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.320]   but we have lots of really good public transport options
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.720]   with the main couple being the Elizabeth Line,
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:09.320]   which only just launched a few months ago back in May.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.040]   And that is basically like a tube line,
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.120]   and it can actually get you into Paddington Station.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.920]   It can get you into central London.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.920]   It also can get you to east London
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.680]   to Liverpool Street Station.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.400]   And it only costs 12 pounds 70 at the moment, which is great.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.880]   There's also the Heathrow Express,
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.480]   which gets into Paddington,
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.560]   and it's faster than the Elizabeth Line.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:34.500]   It only takes about 16 minutes, I think it is,
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:38.020]   but it's also 25 pounds per adult,
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:41.160]   although kids under 16 go free with an adult.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.800]   It also doesn't really make sense to take
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.680]   the Heathrow Express 'cause you might not be staying
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.960]   anywhere near Paddington.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.160]   So your best bet really is to use CityMapper or Google Maps
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.520]   and navigate from Heathrow to your hotel
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.840]   and see which options are saying for you,
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.920]   but also make sure you adjust for your arrival time
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.920]   because if it's really early or really late,
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:06.280]   then the availability drastically reduces.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.680]   So then you might actually get stuck just taking a taxi
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.120]   or a very, very long night bus.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.080]   - We were talking about nightlife.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.000]   I know the London theater scene is pretty big.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.640]   In New York, my wife and I hit up a lot of Broadway shows.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.240]   We did the rush stuff to get discounts on tickets.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.360]   We did all the kind of cool, crazy theater,
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.280]   immersive stuff like "Sleep No More."
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.760]   Anything stand out in those areas?
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.680]   - Yes, so the people who have done "Sleep No More,"
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.440]   so "Punch Drunk," they recently have opened
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.560]   a similar to "Sleep No More" show
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.760]   called "The Burnt City" here in London.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.760]   And I just went last week and it was awesome.
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.480]   Highly, highly recommend it.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.880]   For people who don't know what that is,
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.200]   it's like immersive theater.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.440]   First of all, if you're a viewer, you have to wear a mask.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.000]   You always have to keep this mask on.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.080]   And you go into what's like this huge set.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.440]   - And we don't mean like a COVID mask.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.920]   We're talking like face mask.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.040]   - Exactly, it kind of looks like the scream mask
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.080]   a little bit, not as quite as scary, I think.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.520]   And then what you do is you go into what is like
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.600]   basically a massive movie set
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.440]   that has multiple different rooms
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.880]   and all these different props,
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.840]   and you see live actors that are acting out
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.200]   different scenarios.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.000]   And sometimes they interact, sometimes they split ways,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.280]   and you follow all of these people around
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.760]   and follow their stories.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.480]   And the details are amazing.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.840]   Like even the smells of the room are different.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.280]   Chris, I know I'm preaching to the choir here.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.240]   You've done all this already,
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.280]   but it was a really amazing theatrical experience.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.600]   They're running until April, I think, at the moment.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.440]   So if you're in London before April, 2023,
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.680]   definitely check that out.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.040]   But if you wanna do something a little bit more traditional
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.560]   in the London theater scene,
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:44.080]   there is the longest running theater show of all time
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.000]   here in London,
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.840]   which is called Agatha Christie's "The Mousetrap."
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.680]   And it's been on for 70 years.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.600]   So this is the 70 year anniversary.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.960]   So it's actually quite special if you end up getting like,
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.160]   I guess it's only a few people will be able to get there.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.640]   Before, it's a 71st year, but still.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.800]   It is like a linchpin of London theater.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.920]   And it's very kind of old school.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:10.440]   And it very much represents British whodunit theater,
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.960]   which is a little bit like over the top,
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.160]   but it's really fun.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.680]   And it's really cool.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.440]   It's just definitely like a very London experience.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.880]   So I would highly recommend people get tickets to that.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.440]   And you can actually get like 15 pound tickets for that,
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.800]   even if you book in advance,
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.120]   if you just go for the really high up seats.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.360]   But they also do some last minute deals as well,
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.640]   which you can get through TKTS,
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.760]   or it's also called Official London Theater.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:35.720]   - Wow, okay.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.320]   I feel like this is a masterclass in London,
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.160]   which was the goal.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.560]   We talked, I think about most of the things
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.560]   people need to plan out in advance.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.600]   So I just wanna recap,
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.440]   like make your reservations at restaurants.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.920]   If you wanna go to hotspots
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.800]   and you wanna eat in prime time,
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.680]   any tickets for things,
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.840]   especially during peak season tourist attractions,
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.640]   any other things that people really need to make sure
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.440]   they figure out before they get there?
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.320]   - If you're doing peak season,
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.080]   anything that you can book in advance is a good idea.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.640]   'Cause also ever since COVID,
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.040]   a lot of the major attractions are now having timed entry.
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.520]   Not all of them stick to it,
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:10.080]   but they will sell out for a certain time.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.880]   So if you've got a pretty strict schedule
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.240]   that you wanna stick to,
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.880]   then at least give yourself a couple of days ahead of time
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.040]   to book the tickets.
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.480]   So you don't have to worry about like,
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.160]   oh, well now we didn't get the time that we wanted.
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.340]   So we're gonna have to run back
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.800]   and do this and do that, blah, blah, blah.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.280]   I would say in 2023,
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.080]   anyone who's visiting tourism
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.640]   has really come back with a vengeance.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:34.960]   And we're already seeing availability of hotels really low
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.040]   for even like the end of next year.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.100]   So I would definitely recommend anyone coming next year
[01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:43.960]   to book hotel as quickly as possible.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.280]   You can always do something that you can cancel,
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.680]   but it would just be good to have something
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.480]   just in case you don't find anything else
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.920]   at the price that you're looking for.
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.360]   So just get it done, do it in advance.
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.400]   - Any favorites amongst the hotels
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.260]   that fall in that category of like,
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.960]   you might not find them on the major sites,
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.360]   you might overlook it 'cause it seems like it
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.720]   is this random property.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:06.000]   - Yeah, so there's one place I really like,
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.320]   again, in East London, it's called Mama Shelter.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.640]   I think it's a Parisian brand
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.760]   'cause they've got a few places in France.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.960]   So-- - And LA.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.800]   - And oh, that's right, they've got the one in LA, yeah.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.760]   - I helped our au pair book a room there like six months ago
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.280]   so and she said it was really cool.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.240]   - Yeah, they've got a really nice rooftop at that one.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.080]   It's really nice.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:27.200]   The one here, I think gets overlooked sometimes
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.760]   because it's a little bit out of the way
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.520]   if you wanna do only the main attractions
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.920]   but it's actually really well located
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.200]   if you wanna do some of the more local stuff
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.040]   in East London.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.400]   For example, it's not far from Broadway Market
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.520]   which is this Saturday market that's quite famous now.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.800]   Lots of great stalls selling food and jewelry
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.000]   and artisan pieces and things like that.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.480]   Also walkable in about 20 minutes to Shoreditch
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.200]   or there's a bus that will get you there even quicker.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.920]   And I would say it's on the higher range of budget hotels
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.880]   but the staff are amazing.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.440]   It's really colorful.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.760]   They do karaoke nights.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.920]   They've got a gym there.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.820]   And if you book in advance,
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:05.120]   you can get a pretty good deal there.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.480]   So that's probably one of my favorite recommendations
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.600]   for hotels.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.520]   - Anything on the next tier up like the mid range?
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.760]   - The mid range.
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.600]   So I really like the Henrietta Hotel.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:15.680]   It's more luxury.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.500]   The Henrietta Hotel is right in Covent Garden.
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:22.320]   It is a small boutique hotel that is French inspired
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.320]   and really beautiful decor.
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.160]   You can't get any better on the location.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.840]   You just walk out the front door, you're in Covent Garden.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:29.680]   It's amazing.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.360]   And the rooms are beautiful and they're big
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.040]   and the bathrooms are amazing.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.920]   And then I have a really special luxury
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.480]   high-end recommendation.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.440]   We talked about the Shangri-La earlier.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.160]   That hotel is the highest hotel in London, obviously,
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.000]   'cause it's in the tallest building in Western Europe
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   and is super special too because they have an indoor pool
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.720]   which is the highest hotel pool in Western Europe
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.200]   but probably a lot of other parts of Europe as well.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.680]   So it's got floor to ceiling windows
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.960]   and you're just swimming around, looking down onto London
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.080]   and across the skyline.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.600]   It's a pretty special experience.
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:07.440]   I recommend that one.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.400]   We filmed a video in one of their suites there.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.280]   It was like the coolest experience.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.880]   It was awesome.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:14.720]   - There are gonna be a lot of links
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.040]   in the show notes to anything you mentioned.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.880]   Send me all those links also.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.740]   For anyone who's new and hasn't heard,
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:22.000]   we have a hotel booking service at All The Hacks
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.120]   for like those five-star hotels.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:27.240]   Can hook you up with usually an upgrade, a property credit,
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.640]   late check-in, early check-out,
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.240]   free breakfast, all that stuff.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.840]   So you just go to allthehacks.com/upgrades
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.440]   and you can see that.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.200]   A couple other hotel things.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.200]   So one, this is new for me.
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.940]   Normally, we stay at hotels
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:42.320]   and we're never really the Airbnb type.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:44.240]   And then we started traveling with a family
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.960]   and we were like, okay, we got two adults,
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.560]   two kids and an au pair.
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.680]   We were looking at hotels.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.240]   One of the challenges in Europe
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.620]   is that a lot of hotels have capacity limits on rooms.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.840]   I do know that if you are booking a chain,
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.160]   whether it's Hyatt or Accor or Marriott or Hilton,
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.960]   I think almost all of them have a program in Europe,
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.680]   including some of the hotels in London
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.000]   where you get 50% off the second room.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.960]   So definitely inquire.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.200]   It's not just if you book two rooms,
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.000]   but if you book two rooms and your kids are coming,
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.740]   they give you a deal for that second room.
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.640]   That's true in a lot of other places.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.600]   And then we booked an Airbnb and I didn't know this,
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.800]   but you can negotiate Airbnbs.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.920]   And so we saw a place, we're planning it pretty last minute
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.120]   and we were like, hey, you have six days free.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.920]   We're gonna be there for those exact six days you have free.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.480]   We're coming in a week.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:32.720]   Your place is a little nicer
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:33.920]   than some of the places we're looking at
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.840]   and it's a little more expensive.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.240]   If you could bring it down 25%, we'd book it.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.880]   And we did that for London.
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.120]   We're also going to Paris
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:43.160]   and both places brought the price down about 20%
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.160]   and we booked it right away.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.520]   And so we were able to save 20%.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.700]   Normally, I think the idea of staying at a hotel
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:48.680]   where you got free breakfast
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.080]   and there's a lot more things figured out was easier.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.360]   But it turns out if you're two adults,
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:54.880]   two kids in an au pair,
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.040]   we just couldn't find a hotel setup that worked,
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.360]   especially over the holidays,
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.820]   where we would be able to have a place
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:00.920]   that we could hang out
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.400]   while the kids are sleeping in the rooms.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.760]   For the next little bit, it's gonna be hard for us.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.200]   - Can I give a recommendation
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.200]   for anyone who is looking for something like that
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.480]   and wants to do almost like a service department?
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.440]   - I don't even know what that means,
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.440]   but of course you can.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:16.320]   - It's like an apart hotel, I would say.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.900]   So there's this brand here in London
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.840]   called the Cheval Residences.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.040]   You can get pretty good deals there if you book in advance.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.860]   So you just have to kind of like play it out.
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:29.860]   But they've got one property that overlooks Tower Bridge
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:31.920]   and they have apartments.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.080]   You can get like two bedroom.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.920]   I think they have three bedroom as well.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.520]   And they're great with kids
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:39.760]   because they can provide anything you might need,
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.760]   like cribs, high chairs.
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:44.880]   You can accommodate stuff if you wanna bring your pets.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.120]   Anything you basically need, they can give it to you.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:49.160]   And then this place is extra special
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.840]   because if you get one of the Riverside places,
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.600]   you wake up and you go on your little balcony
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.280]   and overlook Tower Bridge, it's amazing.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.800]   Personally for us, we try to dissuade people from Airbnb
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.160]   just because of the ethical side of it in London.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.160]   We're having a really bad housing crisis here.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.200]   So I usually try to push people to apart hotels
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.360]   and with families who need like the multiple rooms
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.960]   off of the living area,
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.480]   Cheval usually is like a really good option for that.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.420]   And it's really nice.
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:20.360]   - Well, I apologize for contributing to your
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.880]   London problems.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.720]   - It's okay.
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:23.600]   It's a tricky one.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.880]   You're not the only people who have struggled that.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:28.520]   And that's part of where Airbnb has flourished
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.360]   is for stuff like that.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.680]   So it's not to shame you or anything,
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.360]   but I try to give alternatives.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.440]   - And on the topic of kids,
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.680]   what's the vibe of bringing your kids around?
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.280]   People are annoyed by it.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:38.400]   Are they cool?
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.240]   What should we be thinking?
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.320]   Can you give my wife breastfeed in public?
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.720]   I know London's a little conservative.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.320]   - She can definitely breastfeed in public.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.320]   That's totally fine.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.200]   You know, I don't have kids.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.760]   So I can't like fully speak for families
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.760]   who are going out in the world all the time
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.920]   in London with children.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.240]   Most of the time though,
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:56.080]   as long as the kids are fairly well-behaved
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.800]   and they're feeling okay,
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.000]   it's pretty doable,
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.120]   especially during the day.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.320]   Like you can take the kids anywhere during the day.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.800]   All restaurants will take them.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.840]   They'll accommodate them.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.560]   All of the sites and everything, obviously.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.080]   And like we've talked about pubs,
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.800]   you can take the kids to the pubs during the day as well.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:15.060]   So generally the reception is good.
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.860]   And I have been told by parent friends
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:19.160]   that the reception is better in London
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.780]   than like New York and some of the other major cities
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:23.120]   that they've been in.
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:26.140]   - Well, I am incredibly excited for this trip.
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:28.780]   I have one last thing before we wrap.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.820]   We're not gonna put this in the show notes.
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:32.800]   You've already given a lot of great recommendations,
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:35.480]   but is there one like best kept secret
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.320]   that you were like,
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:37.160]   I don't really want anyone to know
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.220]   that this restaurant is here.
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:39.060]   It's my favorite.
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.440]   It's not crowded yet or bar or something
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.340]   that we can leave right at the end of the episode
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:45.380]   only for the people that are still here.
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.540]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:51.540]   There's a cocktail bar that's called Lounge Bohemia
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:54.480]   and it is in Shoreditch.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:57.100]   I had passed it a million times.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.580]   It's just like a very random door.
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:01.140]   I would say it's speakeasy vibes.
[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:04.200]   I'd pass it a million times over my nine, 10 years here.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.920]   And someone eventually was like,
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:06.740]   oh, you've never been there.
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:07.580]   You should go try it.
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:08.400]   And I was like, okay.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.220]   And I randomly went in there one day
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:14.140]   and it's this tiny, tiny little basement bar
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:17.100]   that has like 10 seats
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:21.380]   and they do very experimental cocktails.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:23.480]   Basically the guy who runs it,
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.740]   who ironically does not drink.
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.420]   So his wife tests all the cocktails for him,
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:31.900]   but he runs this bar as like a tester
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.300]   for the work that he does for like corporate events
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.660]   and things like that.
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.420]   And he gets hard to do these like crazy, crazy,
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:41.980]   huge special events, really high end.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:44.580]   But you can go to Lounge Bohemia
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:48.540]   and you can do a tasting menu.
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.820]   And it's, I believe, five different cocktails
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:52.700]   that are like off the wall.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.020]   Like one of the cocktails I had,
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:56.780]   it was called a Canadian Breakfast
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:59.320]   and they brought out this little tray
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:04.260]   that had a little pan of blueberry pancakes.
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:07.900]   And then they lit a fire and like cooked the pancakes.
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:10.900]   And then you mixed up the jam
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:12.460]   and that was like part of the drink.
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:14.700]   And then you put the pancakes in the drink.
[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.220]   It's just crazy stuff like that.
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:18.380]   One of the cocktails is called Winnie the Pooh
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:22.540]   and it has an actual bee on the side of it.
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:25.140]   I'm vegetarian, so I made sure that no bees were hurt
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:26.380]   in the making of this cocktail.
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:28.540]   They're residual bees from, I forget what he was.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:29.580]   He said it was exactly,
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:31.580]   that would have just gone to waste anyway, actually.
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:34.980]   But it's an actual bee that sits on the side of the drink
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:36.720]   and you can eat it.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.620]   So it's like off the wall, crazy, crazy stuff.
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:44.620]   Because it's so small, you do need to book ahead.
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:46.960]   But if you're like a cocktail connoisseur
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.220]   who really likes off the wall, crazy stuff,
[01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:51.020]   that's like the best place to go.
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.180]   - I feel like you just described me.
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.260]   I'm like, I love crazy, weird cocktail.
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:57.140]   The only twist that would make it like hit every mark for me
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:58.900]   is if it was also a spicy cocktail.
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.020]   But I'm sure there is one there that meets that criteria.
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:03.620]   So. - Yes, definitely.
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.120]   - Okay, so I've been fortunate
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.460]   to peruse a ton of your content,
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:10.380]   but where can everyone here go to plan their next trip
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:12.740]   and get all the stuff you're putting out?
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:16.180]   - So everything is under the name Love & London.
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:19.300]   We have over 300 YouTube videos at this point
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:21.900]   talking about how to take the tube,
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:24.940]   where to eat, things like that, mistakes not to make.
[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:26.060]   We also have a website.
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:30.140]   We've got Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, and email lists.
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:32.780]   So there's tons of free content.
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:34.980]   And then we've got a few of our paid guides
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:36.540]   like the itineraries that we talked about,
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:38.420]   which are all linked on the website.
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:40.380]   And there's a one-on-one guide that's also free
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:42.320]   that I'll link to in the show notes, which was great,
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.860]   like just kind of high level overview.
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:46.460]   One thing that I think is the like crown jewel
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:48.220]   of the content that you sell
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:50.620]   is so much of my trip planning
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:52.720]   is usually done in Google Maps.
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:55.380]   And we're just really far behind on this trip
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:57.140]   because we planned it a week ago.
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:00.020]   And in the guide, it was like, click here, boom,
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.420]   here is your Google Map.
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:02.460]   And I was like, what?
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:06.500]   So I now have this like better than I normally would layout,
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.380]   like with icons of this is a restaurant,
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:10.260]   this is a bar, that kind of stuff.
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:15.260]   And I think that that is undersold on your website
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:17.980]   because I think you could just sell
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:20.540]   for maybe even the same price, the Google Map of it.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:22.580]   So that was my favorite feature
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.820]   is that now I have Google Maps loaded on my phone
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:26.620]   where I'm like, when we're out and about,
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:28.700]   we know what we're doing and we could find cool spots.
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.580]   So thank you for putting those in there.
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:31.420]   - Yeah, of course.
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.940]   - Make sure everyone else knows about them.
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:34.980]   - Cool, I added that 'cause I was like,
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:36.800]   I feel like when I get stuff like this,
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.820]   I'm always just adding it to Google Maps anyway.
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:42.020]   So I'm like, why don't I just do it for them?
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:42.940]   So it made sense.
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:46.180]   Also, we do have something for your listeners.
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:49.020]   We do have a special discount that can be used
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.620]   in the Love in London shop,
[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:53.500]   which is where you can buy all of our digital travel guides.
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.980]   So we will put a little discount code
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:01.180]   for 10% off the entire shop in the show notes
[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:02.820]   or we'll put it somewhere.
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:03.820]   - Yeah, we'll put it in the show notes.
[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:04.660]   - Perfect. - Yeah, we'll put
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:05.920]   in the show notes so you can find that
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.540]   and everybody can check that out.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.620]   Thank you for doing that.
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:10.460]   And even more, thank you for being here.
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:12.020]   I'm so excited about this trip
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:14.020]   and we have a lot of stuff to figure out.
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:15.020]   - Good, no, it's great.
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:16.120]   Thank you so much for having me.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:17.100]   I appreciate it.
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.620]   - In today's internet age,
[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:22.620]   people's personal information is being shared online
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:25.220]   with the click of a button without their consent
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.320]   and it happens all the time.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.940]   But you can tackle this problem
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:30.840]   thanks to Delete Me from Abine
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.700]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.140]   for this episode.
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:35.420]   When I used to Google myself,
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:38.000]   I would find hundreds of detailed profiles
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.520]   sharing my cell phone number, address, email,
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.940]   family members, and a lot more.
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:45.380]   At first, I actually tried to remove it all myself,
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:48.180]   which you can do, but after at least 10 hours,
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:51.260]   I signed up for Delete Me and it was so much easier.
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:53.120]   Their software and team of experts
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.020]   will not just find and remove your personal information
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.480]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:02.180]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:04.300]   and get that removed as well.
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.460]   On average, Delete Me finds and removes
[01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:09.260]   over 2000 pieces of data for a customer
[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.060]   in their first two years.
[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.500]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.380]   from search results on the web,
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:18.540]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:22.520]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:26.680]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:30.620]   If you're still working to get in all your 2022
[01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:32.780]   tax deductions before the 31st,
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:34.660]   here are a few tips from Daffy,
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:37.700]   who sponsored this episode to help you put money aside
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:41.140]   for charity and save on your 2022 taxes.
[01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:43.780]   One, if you're gonna owe taxes in 2022,
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.740]   look to charitable giving now.
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.220]   The charitable donation deduction
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:48.840]   is one of the most generous.
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:52.460]   You can deduct up to 60% of your adjusted gross income.
[01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:55.660]   Two, if you can, donate appreciated stock,
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:58.200]   ETFs, or crypto instead of cash.
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.320]   You not only get the charitable donation deduction
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.440]   for the full fair market value of assets
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:03.780]   held over one year,
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:05.920]   but you will never owe capital gains tax
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.160]   on those investments.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.140]   Three, use a donor advised fund or DAF.
[01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:12.580]   I personally use Daffy and it's amazing.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:16.100]   A DAF is a tax advantaged account that lets you donate now
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:18.660]   and qualify for the tax deduction this year,
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:20.500]   but gives you time and flexibility
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.000]   in distributing the money to charities who need it.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.860]   Also remember, you don't have to own individual stocks
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:27.900]   to take advantage of these tax savings.
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:30.820]   You can contribute ETF shares to a DAF now,
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:32.400]   avoid capital gains tax,
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.640]   and use cash to ensure your portfolio stays balanced.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.740]   To make all your tax deductible donations
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:40.000]   before year end in one place,
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.160]   go to allthehacks.com/daffy.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:46.320]   Plus, for a limited time, if you visit that link,
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:50.180]   you can get a free $25 to give to the charity of your choice.
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:55.180]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/DAFFY.
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:58.800]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.280]   and supporting the show.

[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:18.560]   Okay, we just got back from our trip last night
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.200]   and I wanna do a quick recap
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.520]   of some of the awesome highlights, things we did,
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.800]   share some stories, as well as talk to you
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:28.060]   about how to get the best deals on your trip to London,
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:31.300]   especially when it comes to using your points on flights.
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:34.960]   So, first off, I just have to say the trip was awesome,
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.740]   but wow, doing a trip like that with kids
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.740]   is so much different.
[01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:42.260]   This isn't the first time we've traveled with kids,
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:44.400]   but our other trips have been to stay with family
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.420]   or go to the beach and not to explore a city.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.980]   So I've been saying that there's this whole parenting
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:52.500]   episode on the horizon that I wanna do with Amy,
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:53.900]   and now that this trip is over,
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:55.700]   we're gonna try to get that done soon
[01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.820]   and we'll talk all about what it's like to travel with kids
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:00.580]   because it is very different.
[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:03.420]   So stay tuned for that, and until then,
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:05.300]   let me talk about London.
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:08.820]   First off, it was so amazing to be there in the winter.
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:12.560]   I don't think any season does the holidays like London.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:14.620]   There are holiday decorations everywhere
[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:18.020]   and strung lights above every other street downtown.
[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:20.420]   It really felt like a magical place,
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:22.380]   and I'm pretty sure another holiday trip
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:23.840]   will be there in our future.
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.760]   I'll run through a bunch of the things we did
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.400]   and I'll try not to repeat anything
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.100]   Jess and I already discussed.
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.180]   First off, we ended up staying at an Airbnb
[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:33.460]   because with two kids that go to bed early
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.820]   and an au pair with us,
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:38.620]   it was gonna be two to three times the price to do a hotel.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:40.740]   And while we definitely missed some of the amenities
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:43.380]   of a hotel, the ability to do laundry,
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:45.860]   have a place to hang out while the kids were asleep,
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:47.900]   and just generally having more space
[01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:50.700]   outweighed what a hotel had to offer for this trip.
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:54.400]   That said, we certainly had quite the Airbnb experience.
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:57.680]   First off, I learned all about Airbnb negotiating,
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:59.460]   which I didn't realize was a thing
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:01.640]   until I just tried it myself.
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.080]   Since we were booking last minute,
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.400]   I figured why not reach out to the more expensive,
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.040]   nicer place and see if they would offer a discount
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.060]   of 20 to 25%.
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:11.560]   Sure enough, it worked.
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.480]   And I actually since have talked to a few hosts
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:18.200]   who've told me that anywhere from 20 to 50%
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.620]   of the people staying with them try to negotiate
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:23.220]   and they often make special offers.
[01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:25.300]   So if you're booking an Airbnb,
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:26.940]   definitely ask if you can get a deal
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:28.540]   and you might get rewarded.
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:31.860]   We actually spent a week in Paris before London.
[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:33.540]   I won't cover that in this episode,
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:35.960]   but we ended up getting a deal at both places.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.940]   The person in London actually first said
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:40.980]   they'd only give us a deal if we booked off Airbnb
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:43.900]   and wired the money, but I didn't wanna take that risk.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:46.340]   I didn't wanna lose the Airbnb protections,
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:48.600]   which became very important.
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.220]   So we ended up settling on a discount,
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:53.380]   a little bit less, closer to 15%,
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:54.980]   but it ended up being the best move.
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:56.420]   So when we got to London,
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:57.660]   we checked into what we thought
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:59.640]   was gonna be an incredible place.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.520]   It was in an amazing location near Paddington Station
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.480]   and Hyde Park.
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:05.620]   It had great reviews,
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:08.620]   but it was pretty downhill from there.
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:11.820]   We checked in and it was almost 100 degrees upstairs
[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:15.700]   in all the bedrooms and the radiators were all so hot
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:18.060]   that you would burn yourself if you touch them,
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:20.140]   which is hard to explain to a toddler
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:22.460]   who loves to run around and touch everything.
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:24.820]   So we tried to open the windows to cool it down,
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:28.140]   and in one bedroom, the windows were actually screwed shut,
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:32.100]   and the other bedroom had zero windows and zero ventilation.
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:34.380]   The carpets upstairs were also stained a bit.
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:36.000]   The dishes weren't that clean.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.660]   Some of the glasses in the cabinets had lipstick on them,
[01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.660]   and then there was just this smell
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:42.720]   that was really hard to put your finger on
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:44.880]   because they had those little fragrance diffusers
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.500]   in every single room of the house trying to cover it up.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.660]   The funny thing was that any one of those issues
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:51.740]   probably wasn't a big enough issue
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:53.780]   to send a message to the host about,
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:56.780]   but the next day we realized that the downstairs area,
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:58.640]   which was the living room and the kitchen,
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.440]   could not be heated.
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.540]   It was one of the coldest times ever.
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:03.740]   In fact, when we showed up,
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:06.300]   there was snow all over the place.
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:09.800]   So when we go to the thermostat and it says it's 86,
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:12.380]   but it actually feels like it's closer to 60,
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:15.220]   and there wasn't a single way to get the heat kicked in,
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:17.340]   it wasn't the most comfortable time.
[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:19.040]   So I didn't actually know what to do
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:20.320]   in a situation like this.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.880]   If it were a hotel, I'd just ask for a new room,
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:25.880]   ask for a partial refund, or get some bonus points,
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:28.720]   but for an Airbnb, it wasn't that clear.
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:30.640]   I didn't necessarily want them to send a cleaner
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.400]   to wash a handful of dishes.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.840]   I didn't really think they were gonna be able
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:35.400]   to clean the carpets,
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:37.120]   and obviously if they could fix the heat,
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.180]   that would be great, but I messaged them
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:41.240]   and they didn't seem the most responsive
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.880]   to that single issue.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:45.960]   So I called Airbnb and asked them what I should do,
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.280]   and they were very underwhelming.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:49.280]   They basically said, "Oh, well, we can call the host
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.680]   "and tell them about all the issues."
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:52.120]   And I said, "Well, hold off,
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.760]   "let me send a message to the host."
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.520]   So I wrote a long message to the host
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.280]   that detailed out all the issues,
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.680]   and I said, "Hey, let me know what you think
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.640]   "we should do about this."
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.640]   After that, I responded to Airbnb and said,
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.080]   "Hey, I'd reached out to the host,
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:06.620]   "so if you wanna connect with them as well,
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:08.680]   "you're welcome to, because I thought it would be good
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:10.860]   "to reach out to the host first."
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:12.400]   Well, it didn't go that well,
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.920]   because despite that I had emailed the host first,
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:16.960]   as soon as they heard from Airbnb,
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:19.240]   they sent me a message that they were very uncomfortable
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.720]   with the fact that I contacted Airbnb support
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:24.240]   before letting him resolve all the issues,
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:25.720]   and that he was no longer comfortable
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.080]   with us staying in the home,
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.600]   and he would prefer that I checked out
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:30.060]   and found a new place to stay.
[01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:31.700]   So the silver lining in this,
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:34.560]   which was a very frustrating and stressful experience,
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:37.560]   was that I got to put Airbnb's air cover protection
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:38.640]   to the test.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.820]   Specifically, their get what you booked guarantee,
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:44.700]   which actually says, "If at any time during your stay,
[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:46.460]   "your listing isn't as advertised,
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:48.580]   "for example, the refrigerator stops working
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:50.520]   "and your host can't easily fix it,
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.900]   "or it has fewer bedrooms than listed,
[01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:54.560]   "you'll have three days to report it,
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:57.000]   "and we'll find you a similar or better home,
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.220]   "or we'll refund you."
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:25:59.780]   So my biggest concern reading that,
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:02.080]   and all the subsequent terms around it,
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.660]   is that it wasn't very clear
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:06.100]   whether they would find you the bigger or similar home,
[01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:07.580]   or refund you.
[01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:10.460]   And in our case, a refund wouldn't have been very helpful,
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:12.900]   because there weren't a lot of places that we could book.
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:14.980]   Actually, there were pretty much none
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.380]   that were a similar size, quality, and location
[01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:18.420]   at that price.
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:21.340]   So I was a bit worried when the Airbnb support rep
[01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:23.160]   started sending me suggestions of places
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.580]   they could help us rebook,
[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:27.580]   because we had booked a nice three-bedroom place,
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:30.220]   and all of their suggestions were studios,
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:33.560]   or one bedrooms with nowhere near enough room.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.420]   However, when I sent them the three-bedroom place
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:39.060]   that I found, that had all the same amenities,
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:42.620]   was centrally located, had a crib, had laundry in the unit,
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:45.180]   they actually created a coupon for me
[01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:48.100]   that brought the price down by 50%,
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:50.180]   so we didn't have to pay any extra.
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:52.460]   So two days into our six-night stay,
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:54.140]   we moved into an amazing place,
[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:55.740]   and wow, was it an upgrade
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:57.540]   from the previous place we stayed at.
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:00.140]   It was in an incredible location in Covent Garden,
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:02.540]   and it was such a nice place.
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:04.140]   Funny enough, we had a similar issue
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:05.460]   with the heat going out,
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:07.860]   but this host had a very different attitude,
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:11.620]   and had six heaters delivered before the kids' next nap time
[01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:13.220]   and scheduled an emergency plumber
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:15.620]   to get things fixed within 24 hours.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.940]   But the real highlight was the Harry Potter-themed kids' room.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:20.860]   I really can't describe how cool it was,
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:23.700]   so if you're curious, check out the link in the show notes.
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:25.740]   It had a train-themed bunk bed,
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:29.180]   a custom bookshelf that looked like a bunch of suitcases,
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:31.960]   a hollow tree with a reading area inside it,
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:34.260]   and a mini castle on one wall.
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:37.340]   I definitely have some inspiration for a future kids' room,
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.580]   but if you're ever in London
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:41.700]   and this place is in your budget, I highly recommend it.
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:44.460]   It was discounted 35% because it was last minute,
[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:47.060]   and then Airbnb covered half of the rest,
[01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:50.100]   so you probably won't get it for almost 70% off,
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:51.580]   but I will say that it was amazing,
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:53.940]   and we would love to stay there again.
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:55.820]   And even if that place isn't the right fit,
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:59.020]   I definitely recommend staying in the Covent Garden area.
[01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:01.500]   It was so central to so many things,
[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.620]   and especially when you have kids,
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:06.540]   it means you don't lose all those short, precious hours
[01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:08.220]   between naps on the train.
[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:10.700]   Okay, so that was maybe more than you asked for,
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:12.100]   but I thought it was worth sharing
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:14.380]   because one of my biggest fears with Airbnb
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:15.700]   is that you'll get stuck in a place
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:18.220]   that doesn't quite match the photos or the reviews,
[01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:20.180]   and you won't have a good alternative.
[01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:21.940]   Well, I now feel a lot better
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:25.220]   having put the air cover policy to the test.
[01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:26.500]   That said, going forward,
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:30.420]   I will put an even higher emphasis on reading those reviews,
[01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:32.260]   and once the kids are a bit older,
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:34.900]   I think hotels will definitely be back on the table,
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:36.900]   at least for trips in cities.
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:38.620]   As for the rest of our time in London,
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:40.420]   let me share some highlights.
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:42.100]   When it comes with transportation,
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.860]   being able to use Apple Pay or a tap-to-pay credit card
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:48.100]   to ride the Tube or a bus was so great.
[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:49.420]   Coming off the heels of Paris,
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:51.140]   where we were carrying around 10 packs
[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:54.020]   of paper Metro tickets that got demagnetized
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:56.100]   by being too close to our cell phones,
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:58.380]   it was so convenient and easy.
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:00.420]   I did take a few Ubers for meetings,
[01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:02.260]   but if you wanna order a London cab,
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:05.380]   the app Free Now was what everyone said to use
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.980]   and was so easy.
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.660]   In fact, with an early morning flight
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:10.780]   and a new Airbnb that wasn't that close
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:12.260]   to the Heathrow trains,
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:14.340]   we opted for a cab to get to the airport.
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:16.820]   Leaving at 6 a.m., it only took 40 minutes,
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:21.500]   and it was 73 pounds versus 40 pounds on the Elizabeth Line
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:24.140]   or 75 pounds on the Heathrow Express.
[01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:25.900]   Also, speaking of paying for things,
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:28.260]   there might be somewhere you need cash in London,
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:29.540]   but I never found it.
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:32.500]   Every restaurant, food stall, Christmas market vendor,
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:35.620]   and convenience store had a tap-to-pay credit card terminal
[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:39.740]   that made the cash I took from the ATM completely useless,
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.940]   though given the current exchange rate,
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:44.180]   those 200 pounds might be worth a lot more
[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:45.260]   next time we visit.
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:47.460]   As for activities, I'll review a few things.
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.820]   First, the London Transport Museum.
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:51.620]   Our daughter absolutely loved it,
[01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:53.860]   so if you have kids, I'd recommend it,
[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:56.780]   but as someone who's pretty fascinated by transportation,
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:58.700]   I was a little underwhelmed.
[01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:01.020]   Hamley's, which is a gigantic toy store,
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:02.820]   was similarly loved by my daughter
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:04.660]   and even fun for the adults,
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:06.060]   but if you're going during the holidays
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:09.220]   and you wanna see Santa, you do need a reservation.
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:11.300]   We also checked out the Natural History Museum,
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:13.100]   which was really awesome.
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:15.220]   I don't think we had the time to do it justice,
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:18.700]   but it's a free museum, and it was really impressive.
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:19.980]   We also went around the corner
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.260]   to do a science-themed afternoon tea
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:25.340]   at the Ampersand Hotel, which was so much fun,
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:27.140]   and while they're pretty expensive,
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:29.740]   I think that if we had planned things a little more,
[01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:32.260]   we might've even done a second afternoon tea,
[01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.140]   and despite the kids' theme,
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:36.460]   Amy, Marta, our au pair, and I
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:38.300]   all really enjoyed it as well.
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:41.020]   As for food, I have a few recommendations.
[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:44.300]   It is hard to put anything higher on the list than Dishoom,
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:47.420]   which has a few amazing Indian restaurants in London
[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:50.300]   with fantastic bars, delicious chai,
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:52.660]   and ridiculously good food.
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:55.060]   Specifically, I would definitely check out
[01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:58.900]   the House Black Doll, the Chicken Ruby, and the Sali Boti.
[01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:01.140]   They were so delicious.
[01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:03.860]   In fact, Dishoom was so good for dinner
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:07.060]   that we literally came back the next morning for breakfast,
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:10.340]   where you should not skip out on the double bacon naan roll,
[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:13.860]   and then we came back again for breakfast a few days later.
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:17.380]   It is just so good, so definitely check it out.
[01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:19.900]   We didn't have a reservation any of the three times we went,
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:22.420]   but if you wanna go without waiting at dinnertime,
[01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:24.180]   I definitely suggest making one.
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:25.900]   We also went to Borough Market one day
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:29.220]   and ate all kinds of delicious food from the food vendors.
[01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:32.220]   If you find yourself on the northwest side of Hyde Park,
[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:35.220]   Norma's Malaysian restaurant was amazing,
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:37.260]   and the Mitre Lancaster Gate Pub
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:39.580]   was a perfect spot for a pub dinner.
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:41.100]   Amy and I did have one dinner out
[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:43.180]   without the kids at Ave Mario,
[01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:46.460]   which was such a fun place for a dinner with great food,
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:48.940]   but the Silk Handkerchiefs pasta dish
[01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:52.620]   I had down the street at Bancon the night before
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:56.260]   might have been one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had.
[01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:58.020]   Amy wasn't feeling great that night,
[01:31:58.020 --> 01:31:59.780]   so I had a solo dinner at the bar,
[01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:02.500]   and it was so good that I wish we had one more night
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:04.340]   so I could take her back.
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:06.820]   Finally, that same night, I snuck out on my own
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:10.020]   to check out Opium, the cocktail bar that Jess recommended,
[01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:11.180]   and it was awesome.
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:13.580]   Definitely suggest heading there.
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:15.500]   I also tried to go to the Barbery,
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:18.840]   but they had zero room for walk-ins, so that didn't happen,
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:21.260]   but the Seven Dials Market around the corner
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:23.340]   is a fantastic alternative.
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:25.260]   It's like an indoor street market
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:27.140]   with a couple dozen food vendors
[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:30.060]   with cuisines from every corner of the globe.
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:32.220]   My favorites were the bao from Yum Bun
[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:33.860]   and the chai from Chai Guys,
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:36.940]   but I didn't get to try as many things as I wanted.
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:39.260]   So I think that covers my London recap,
[01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:41.460]   and if you're not excited about a trip to London
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:42.980]   at this point, I'm really not sure
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:44.440]   why you're still listening,
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:45.900]   but I think you should be excited
[01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:47.340]   because it was so much fun,
[01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:49.420]   and I'm already looking forward to going back,
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:51.660]   and we literally just got home yesterday.
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:54.940]   So as for getting there, let's talk about flights.
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:58.300]   You can get to London from 33 different cities in the US,
[01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:00.820]   and almost all of those flights are to Heathrow,
[01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:02.660]   though a few of them are to Gatwick,
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.340]   so if you're searching on Google Flights,
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:07.420]   make sure to put both airports as your destination,
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:09.820]   and those flights are across seven different carriers,
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:12.900]   but if you're willing to change planes in Canada or Europe,
[01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:14.060]   then you could probably add
[01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:16.860]   another two dozen airlines to that list.
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:18.940]   So what are the tactics?
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:20.740]   Because our dates were pretty specific,
[01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:23.380]   I started doing my search on point.me,
[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:24.940]   which, as I've said in the past,
[01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:27.500]   is $1 for your first month on the standard plan
[01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.420]   if you use the code ALLTHEHAX,
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.580]   but they actually sent me an email for the holidays
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:35.140]   saying that the next 25 people that wanna give it a try
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:38.500]   can use ALLTHEHAX for a free 24-hour pass.
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:41.180]   Now, if your dates aren't as flexible,
[01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:44.180]   I do tend to like searching on the airline websites more
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:47.040]   or using a tool called Seat Spy,
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:48.340]   which lets you look at a calendar
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:51.220]   to look at more dates at once to try to find the best deals.
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:53.380]   But here's the summary for London,
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:56.340]   and this applies to Europe a little bit as well.
[01:33:56.340 --> 01:33:58.500]   First, while British Airways and Virgin Atlantic
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:33:59.940]   are great airlines,
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:03.180]   the taxes on their award flights can be so expensive.
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:06.060]   For business class, we're talking over $1,000
[01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:08.800]   round trip per person just in taxes.
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.300]   It is a lot less an economy
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.020]   where you can actually find really great deals.
[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:16.180]   For example, on Virgin, you can get to London from the US
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:20.500]   for 12,500 to 15,000 points per person each way.
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:21.820]   So if you're doing economy,
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:25.060]   it could be worth checking out Virgin or British Airways.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:26.860]   All that said, if you wanna fly business,
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:29.180]   and Virgin or British Airways are the only options,
[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:32.040]   even with taxes at $1,500 a person,
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:33.660]   it's probably gonna be a better deal
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:36.260]   than paying for business class with cash.
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:37.740]   It's just not gonna be as good a deal
[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:39.860]   as what you might find with the following options,
[01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:40.960]   which is what we did.
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:43.420]   I'll start with American, which is a great option,
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:45.460]   and it's a built transfer partner.
[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:48.220]   With round trip awards costing as little as 25
[01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:53.220]   to 30,000 points each way in economy and 57,500 in business,
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:56.020]   and as long as you're booking on American planes
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:58.340]   and not British Airways, which is one of their partners,
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:00.700]   the taxes on their flights is pretty reasonable.
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:03.260]   For Star Alliance, you'll probably be flying on United
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:05.140]   unless you're changing planes in Europe,
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:08.740]   but you can book on any of the Star Alliance carriers.
[01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:09.900]   If you book on United,
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:13.020]   it can be as low as 30,000 miles each way in economy,
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:16.820]   45,000 in premium economy, and 60,000 in business,
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:20.180]   but that same 60,000 point flight in business on United
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:22.880]   can actually be booked with Turkish Air,
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:25.140]   which is a built or Capital One transfer partner
[01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:27.140]   for 45,000 points.
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:29.300]   In fact, that is exactly what we did.
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:31.820]   I found four seats available in business
[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:34.740]   for 60,000 points each way on United,
[01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:36.500]   and then set up a Turkish Air account
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.080]   and called them to book it.
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:39.280]   The other great thing about Turkish
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.700]   is you can actually book the award
[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:42.120]   before you transfer the points,
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:43.500]   so you can be confident you're getting
[01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.020]   exactly what you want.
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.980]   It's a bit frustrating because you have to book on the phone,
[01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:49.420]   which is a bit of a pain,
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:51.740]   but I ended up saving about 60,000 points
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:52.780]   on those four tickets,
[01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:55.060]   so it was definitely worth the phone call.
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:57.720]   Also, no matter where you book that United flight,
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:59.700]   the taxes and fees are pretty reasonable
[01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:01.860]   at a few hundred dollars a person in business
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:03.220]   and even less in economy.
[01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:04.800]   The last option and one of my favorites
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:07.660]   is booking with Air France or KLM's Flying Blue,
[01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:09.780]   which happens to be a transfer partner of Chase,
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:12.320]   Amex, Cap One, Citi, and Built,
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:13.800]   so chances are you probably have a way
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:15.800]   to get your points to their program.
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:18.440]   On top of that, they have great availability to Europe,
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.200]   and both the miles needed and the taxes and fees
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:22.520]   are pretty reasonable,
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:25.160]   not to mention they frequently have transfer bonuses
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.740]   when you move miles over.
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:27.720]   For flights to Europe,
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:30.960]   it's gonna be as little as 25,000 points each way in economy
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:33.340]   and 55,000 in business.
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:35.360]   For our trip, the exact flights we wanted,
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.840]   which were nonstop from SFO to Paris in business,
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:42.520]   were actually 75,000 points plus $195 in taxes.
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:45.900]   However, since there was a 25% transfer bonus to Amex,
[01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:49.700]   we only needed 60,000 Amex points per person to do it.
[01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:53.940]   So we booked SFO to Paris nonstop on Air France
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:57.140]   for 60,000 Amex points that we transferred to Air France
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:00.580]   and paid $195 per person in taxes and fees,
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:01.900]   and then to get home,
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:05.480]   we booked London to SF nonstop on United in business
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:07.500]   for 45,000 Capital One points
[01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.300]   that we transferred to Turkish Air
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:12.840]   plus $302 per person in taxes and fees.
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:15.300]   So we booked four tickets, but per passenger,
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:19.820]   it was 105,000 points plus $500 in taxes
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:23.700]   to fly nonstop business class round trip to Europe.
[01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:27.080]   And when I looked at booking those flights nonstop
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:31.820]   in business with cash, it was about $7,000 per person,
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:35.420]   which means a value of a little over 6 cents per point,
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:37.100]   which is pretty damn good.
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:40.660]   One other thing to share is about bringing a lap infant.
[01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:42.560]   While on domestic flights, they're free,
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:45.680]   it is a totally different situation internationally.
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:49.180]   Depending on the airline, the cost can vary widely.
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:51.780]   For some airlines, it's a fixed number of miles,
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:54.660]   and for others, you have to pay 10 to 25%
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:57.520]   of the full fare cost of that business class ticket.
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:01.280]   So that's the $7,000 ticket that we never would have bought.
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.700]   On Air France, it was the latter,
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:05.780]   at 10% of a full fare business ticket.
[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:10.780]   So we actually had to pay $643, which seems crazy,
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:14.060]   but it almost seemed crazier to spend the miles
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:15.820]   and the dollars to get a six-month-old,
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:17.780]   her own seat in business class.
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:19.280]   For booking the United flight,
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:21.660]   the cost of her seat was actually very different
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:23.540]   depending on how we booked it.
[01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:25.740]   If we'd done it on United, it would have been 10%
[01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:28.860]   of the fare, but it was capped at $250.
[01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:30.460]   Had we booked it on Air Canada,
[01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:32.820]   it would have just been 2,500 miles.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:35.540]   But on Turkish, it was 10% of the adult miles,
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:39.820]   so 4,500 miles in our case, plus taxes and fees,
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:41.660]   which for us was $88.
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:44.300]   Also note that most of these sites don't make it easy
[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:47.580]   to book a Lapinfan online, so we had to call Air France
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:49.960]   and Turkish to do it manually.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:53.180]   And fun hack, as soon as I found the availability
[01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:56.260]   I wanted on Air France, I wanted to book it quickly,
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:58.620]   but it was too late for the U.S. Reservations Office
[01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:02.020]   to be open, and it was too early for the one in France.
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:05.100]   So I used Google Voice, and I called the Tokyo
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:07.300]   Air France office because it was open,
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:10.340]   and we were able to get things booked right then.
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:13.140]   But this hack isn't just for when offices are closed
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:15.820]   and you need to make a booking, it is also great
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:18.660]   for when lines are busy in the U.S.
[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:21.700]   So when there's major weather issues or delays in the U.S.,
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:23.900]   and calling United, American, or Delta
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:26.220]   has you stuck on long wait times,
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:28.700]   try calling the office in London, Tokyo,
[01:39:28.700 --> 01:39:30.740]   or any other country around the world,
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:33.180]   and you can usually get through right away.
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:35.140]   Just make sure to use a service like Google Voice
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:36.860]   so the call isn't that expensive.
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:39.220]   Okay, so that's flights, but I do wanna briefly talk
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:41.060]   about booking hotels with points,
[01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:43.260]   even though we stayed at an Airbnb.
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:45.420]   The short version is that there are so many options
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:47.540]   at every price point that I feel good
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:49.360]   you can find something with your points,
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:52.180]   but because there are so many hotels in London
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:55.220]   and prices are competitive, you might actually be better off
[01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:58.100]   saving your points for flights and just paying cash.
[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:00.940]   However, if you do wanna use points, I'll share a few things.
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:04.100]   First, if you already have your points in a hotel program,
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:05.640]   then you'll probably just be using those
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:06.980]   and searching from their site,
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:08.820]   and you probably are pretty familiar.
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:11.880]   If not, I think the only real way to get a good deal
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:15.020]   in London, at least on the luxury side of the spectrum,
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:18.120]   is to transfer Chase or Bilt points in Bilt with Hyatt.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:21.820]   So I would start just searching straight on the Hyatt site.
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:24.220]   However, if you want a great map
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:27.020]   of all the points hotels options in London,
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:28.500]   I'll put it in the show notes.
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:29.860]   I think it's a little out of date,
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:31.500]   but it's a good starting point.
[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.120]   And I'll also put a link in the show notes
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:35.940]   to a few articles I liked that specifically went through
[01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:39.780]   a bunch of London hotel options at different points budgets.
[01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:41.060]   And if you're booking for a family,
[01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:42.860]   you should know that a lot of hotels
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:45.380]   have max capacity limits in Europe.
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:47.980]   Sometimes it's two, sometimes it's three people.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:49.940]   So definitely make sure that when you're searching,
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:53.100]   you put the right number of guests in your search.
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:55.500]   In general, some of the best points options for families
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:58.180]   are Club Carlson, which lets you book premium
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:00.460]   or bigger rooms for not too many points.
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:03.540]   Marriott, Hilton, and IHG are the most likely to have rooms
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:06.180]   with three plus person capacity.
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:07.400]   And some of the Hyatt hotels,
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:09.120]   like the Churchill and the Andaz,
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.020]   have some large rooms or suites
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:14.020]   that you can book for points that have larger capacities.
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:17.420]   Finally, if you're not gonna use points, two tips.
[01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:20.260]   One, first, if you're looking for luxury hotels,
[01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:22.060]   definitely check out the All The Hacks
[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:23.820]   luxury upgrade program.
[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:26.900]   You can find it at allthehacks.com/upgrade,
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:28.520]   where through a partnership I set up,
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:31.140]   we can get you free upgrades, free breakfast,
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:34.380]   late checkout, and a property credit at hotels in London,
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:36.700]   like the Connett, the Hamyard, the Four Seasons,
[01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:38.020]   and dozens more.
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:38.860]   And this, by the way,
[01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:42.740]   applies to almost any other luxury hotel in the world.
[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:47.100]   Second, check out @hotel on Instagram and send them a DM.
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:50.500]   They sometimes have ridiculously good deals on hotels
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:53.700]   because of the fact that requiring you to DM them
[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:56.060]   makes their access private,
[01:41:56.060 --> 01:41:57.740]   which means they can offer rates better
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:59.580]   than what you see on hotel websites
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:01.100]   or sites like booking.com.
[01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:05.380]   Hopefully that helps you with hotels on your trip,
[01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:08.020]   and I think that covers everything for this episode.
[01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:11.120]   I am so curious to hear what you all think about this one,
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:12.700]   because I've never done a city
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:15.060]   or country-specific travel episode.
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:17.940]   So I would love any or all feedback
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:19.980]   so I know whether to keep doing them,
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:21.580]   what cities to prioritize,
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:24.580]   or if there's anything else I could do to make them better.
[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:27.300]   Finally, happy holidays to everyone.
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:28.980]   I hope you have a wonderful time
[01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:31.180]   celebrating the holiday season with your families.
[01:42:31.180 --> 01:42:34.260]   I am so thankful for all your support this year,
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:35.620]   and I'll see you next week.
[01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:39.240]   (upbeat music)
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:43.060]   (electricity buzzing)
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:45.800]   (birds chirping)
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:56.140]   [ Silence ]
