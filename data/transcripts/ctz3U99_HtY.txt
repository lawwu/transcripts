[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   This week we celebrate Reformation Day, October 31st, the day Martin Luther boldly banged
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.760]   his 95 theses on the church door with nails and a hammer, October 31, 1517. Of course,
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.100]   he more likely glued the document with poster paste and he probably left the decoupage to
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.120]   an assistant actually. So theatrics or not, the date marks the ignition of what would
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.300]   grow into the Protestant Reformation. Last time in episode 1387, we looked at whether
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.260]   or not we should read dead white guys or are they now irrelevant. And as we enter our way
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.080]   closer to Reformation Day this year, we take a look at the legacy of a reformer, John Calvin.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.060]   And to do it, I will share a clip from Pastor John's 1997 biography on John Calvin and his
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.920]   role in shaping the Reformation and our reformed tradition as we know it today. Here's what
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.240]   Pastor John had to say.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.160]   His view of Scripture, which defined the remainder of his ministry, was very high. He said, "We
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:06.160]   owe to the Scripture the same reverence which we owe to God because it proceeded from him
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.920]   alone and has nothing of man mixed with it." His own experience had taught him, "The highest
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.840]   proof of the Scripture derives in general from the fact that God in person speaks in
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.200]   it." Those were the incontrovertible truths for John Calvin. The Scriptures were the voice
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.840]   of God. God vindicates God by bringing us to life by his majestic witness. We see him
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.680]   in his Scriptures and he and they then become authoritative immediately for our lives and
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.720]   what kind of life is born for Calvin. It was a life of invincible constancy in the exposition
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.920]   of Scripture.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.180]   Tracts, institutes, commentaries, commentaries on every New Testament book except Revelation,
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.720]   numerous Old Testament books, but all of it, all of it, including these two books here,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.280]   is exposition of Scripture. Dillenberger says Calvin assumed that his whole theological
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:23.080]   labor was the exposition of Scripture. He wrote at the end of his life, "I have endeavored
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:31.000]   both in my sermons and also in my writings and commentaries to preach the Word purely
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.080]   and chastely and faithfully to interpret his sacred Scriptures." Everything was exposition
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.880]   of Scripture. That was the kind of ministry that was unleashed by his experience. And
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:58.560]   preaching then became the main vehicle. Calvin's preaching was of one kind and it never, ever
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:09.880]   changed. It was sequential, expository preaching through book after book after book. On Sunday
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.440]   morning he always took New Testament, afternoon New Testament, sometimes a Psalm on Sunday,
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:28.440]   during the week three times, always Old Testament. There are only fewer than half a dozen instances
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:36.240]   where he broke pattern for any church year event. So, Don Whitney, if you wonder what
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:45.240]   to do on Christmas, preach on Deuteronomy 29-23 or whatever happens to be next. That's
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:53.140]   what Calvin did. Every Easter, every Christmas he plowed right on through with fewer than
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:01.920]   half a dozen exceptions. Now, to give you an idea, picture this. It's August 25, 1549
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.000]   and he begins a series of messages on the book of Acts. We know this because that was
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.260]   the first time when he had a stenographer who was taking down his sermons. He preached
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.920]   totally without notes and without anything, straight from the Greek and straight from
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.960]   the Hebrew, right there in front of him. He begins Acts on August 25, 1549. He ends Acts
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:32.960]   on Sunday morning in March, 1554. So, from 49 to 54 he's preaching on Acts, straight
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:41.400]   through. And then, after that, he picks up Thessalonians, 46 sermons, Corinthians, 186
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:49.840]   sermons, Pastorals, 86 sermons, Galatians, 43 sermons, Ephesians, 48 sermons, until May
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.120]   of 1558 when he has to quit for half a year because he's sick. As you can well imagine,
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.360]   he might be with the relentless schedule that he's kept. He begins then in 1559, the harmony
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:10.880]   of the Gospels and he dies while he's doing it in 1564. Now, during that time, during
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:18.960]   the week, he's preaching 159 sermons on Job, 200 on Deuteronomy, 353 on Isaiah, 123 on
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.560]   Genesis and so on. The numbers are phenomenal. The point is, this is no accident. He chose
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.240]   to do this. Here's the story that I love that shows how completely self-conscious he is
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:41.120]   in this. On Easter Day, 1538, he's banished out of Geneva that first time, remember? He's
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:50.080]   been preaching for about a year. He's banished for three years to minister in Strasbourg.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:58.680]   They call him back. He comes back in September 1541 and walks into the pulpit and picks up
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:09.080]   at the next verse. And he comments on the fact that he wanted them to know that it was
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:19.840]   just an interlude in his exposition of the Word of God. Why? Why that kind of preaching?
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.640]   Luther didn't do that. Luther preached the Gospel and the Epistle. Spurgeon didn't do
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:34.560]   that. Shamon Spurgeon, maybe or maybe not. Why did he do it this way? Three possible
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:45.480]   reasons. Number one, Calvin believed the lamp of the Word had gone out in Europe. The Word
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:51.480]   had been taken away. Here's what he said. He's confessing his own sin to the Lord. He
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:59.600]   says, "Thy Word, which ought to have shone on all thy people like a lamp, was taken away
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:08.000]   or at least suppressed as to us. And now, O Lord, what remains to a wretch like me but
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.720]   earnestly to supplicate thee not to judge according to my deserts that fearful abandonment
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:24.880]   of thy Word from which in thy wondrous goodness thou hast delivered me?" So you feel in his
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:33.040]   conversion the horror he felt. He saw by the inward testimony of the Holy Spirit the majesty
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:40.040]   of God revealed in the Word and he looked across the church and he said, "What a fearful
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:47.880]   abandonment of the holy precious Word." And his whole life then became, "I am going to
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.760]   lay this Word out every day for the rest of my life. It is so precious." That's reason
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:07.040]   number one. Number two, THL Parker says, "Calvin had a horror of those who preached their own
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:17.240]   ideas in the pulpit." Oh, we need that horror today. He says, "When we enter the pulpit,
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:25.480]   it is not so that we may bring our own dreams and fancies with us." So evidently he believed
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:32.120]   that the best safeguard against bringing my fancies into the pulpit is to systematically
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:40.760]   work my way through God's ordered, inspired, majesty revealing Word. Finally, the third
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:50.160]   reason brings us full circle back to the majesty of God in the Word. He really believed that
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:09:00.520]   when the Word was faithfully exposited, God in His majesty stood forth in the congregation.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:07.640]   Listen to this great exhortation to you from Calvin. "Let the pastors boldly dare all things
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:15.680]   by the Word of God. Let them constrain all the power, glory, excellence of the Word to
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:22.960]   give place to and to obey the divine majesty of this Word. Let them enjoin every one by
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.460]   it from the highest to the lowest. Let them edify the body of Christ. Let them devastate
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:34.120]   Satan's reign. Let them pasture the sheep, kill the wolves, instruct, exhort the rebellious.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:40.760]   Let them bind and loose thunder and lightning if necessary, but let them do all according
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:48.040]   to the Word of God." In other words, the key phrase there is the divine majesty of His
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:56.760]   Word. Calvin believed that if his goal in life was to illustrate the glory of God, and
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:05.560]   if the glory of God is uniquely and self-authenticatingly revealed in the Word of God, then the full
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:14.520]   display of the Word would be the fullest display of the glory. I think that's the way he reasoned.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:20.240]   And my own personal conviction when I ask myself the question, "Can it be done any other
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.520]   way besides preaching? How about just teaching with an overhead? How about small group
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:36.920]   discussions? How about lectures? How about books? How about computer CDs sent to China?"
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.880]   What's to become of preaching? And this is my conviction. I don't know what Calvin would
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:49.040]   say, but I'm a preacher and I have to believe in what I'm doing. And so I want to know why
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:57.160]   I am so drawn to do it. And I believe the answer is nothing will ever replace preaching.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:05.120]   The reason I believe that preaching uniquely, not teaching per se, not reading the Bible
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:12.800]   per se, but preaching to the congregation over a text will always be there is because
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:20.840]   God means for Himself in the fullness of His glory to be extolled and glorified and honored
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:30.760]   and cherished. And something about that event of worship beckons for more than analysis.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:39.520]   It beckons for more than explanation. It beckons for expository exaltation. That's what I like
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:50.920]   to call it. Preaching is the worshipful moment over the Word. It is expository exaltation.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:58.840]   And wherever God-centeredness is alive, wherever the supremacy of God reigns in the hearts
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:07.440]   of a people, something inside will say, "Oh, pastor, do more for us than explain it to
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:16.560]   us. Love it over us. Cherish it over us. Taste it over us. Revel in it over us. Exalt in
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:23.040]   it over us because we need to see it come alive and burn in you." And that is what
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.720]   is called preaching.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:30.200]   Amazing legacy. What a rich tradition we share in the Reformation owing to this man, John
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.480]   Calvin and his ministry from the pulpit. For the full message, see DesiringGod.org and
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:41.080]   look for the title, The Divine Majesty of the Word, John Calvin, the Man and His Preaching,
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.960]   recorded at the 1997 Bethlehem Conference for Pastors.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.080]   And thank you to all the Calvinist preachers out there listening along. Be sure to follow

[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.880]   Next time, we're going to look at the challenges Christians face who have to work on Sundays
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.360]   sometimes. Of course, for the first three centuries of the church, pretty much every
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.840]   Christian had to work on Sunday. So what about doctors, nurses, and first responders who
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.720]   work on Sundays today? What advice would Pastor John have for them? That's next time. I'm
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.480]   your host Tony Rehnke. We'll see you on Friday.
