[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Best-selling author Jerry Bridges passed away today at the age of 86.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.560]   He was not only a friend, he was a big influence on my Christian life, and I know many of you
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.640]   could say the same thing.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.000]   His writings were as wonderful as they were authentic, and I've always had the sense that
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.960]   his books were really the product of the deepest wrestlings that he faced in his own walk with
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960]   the Lord.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.600]   Over the years, I've had the honor to interview Jerry several times, and in the winter of
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.280]   2011, I asked him, looking back over his 60-plus years as a Christian, what were the hard-won
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.360]   lessons that he would want younger believers to take from his life today?
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.360]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.000]   Well, there are probably five significant truths that I would like for a young believer
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.320]   to know.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.920]   Unfortunately, I learned these over a period of a number of years, simply because I was
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.400]   not exposed to the right kind of teaching.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.560]   I'll just take them in the chronological order in which I learned them.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.720]   It doesn't mean that this should be true.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.640]   In fact, if I were going to reverse the chronology, I would certainly do that.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.520]   But the first thing I learned, which really began my walk with the Lord, is that the Bible
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.400]   is meant to be applied specifically in our daily lives, because most people just have
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.040]   the idea that, you know, if I don't murder somebody or don't do these things, I'm okay.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.960]   But I learned that the Bible was meant to be applied in my daily life.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.520]   I was a young officer in the U.S. Navy at the time.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.120]   I was serving under a commanding officer who was not easy to get along with.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.440]   He had almost no people skills.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.160]   And those of us who were younger officers resented him.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.760]   And one day I read 1 Timothy 6, 1, and I'm going to be quoting from the King James Version,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.080]   "Let as many servants as are under the oak count their own masters worthy of all honor,
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.880]   that the name of God and His doctrine be not blasphemed."
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.640]   And immediately I made the application of the principle, "Let a young officer who's
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.280]   serving under a difficult commanding officer count him worthy of all honor.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.800]   For God's sake."
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.960]   So that was a specific application.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.240]   That's what I mean to be very specific and very practical in the application of Scripture.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.280]   Chronologically, the second great truth that I learned was union with Christ, that I am
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.880]   in Christ as the vine and the branches or have that living union.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.880]   So Christ and I have that living union.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.080]   I live in Him, He lives in me, and I depend upon Him for the power to live the Christian
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.080]   life.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.960]   The third significant truth that I learned was the doctrine of election, that I'm a
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.320]   Christian because God chose me from before the foundation of the world.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.160]   And when I was first exposed to that, there was a brand new thought, and I pushed back.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.840]   I thought, "My friend, oh, she's gotten into heresy."
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.520]   But God in His grace opened my eyes to the truth, and I remember very well my reaction
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.880]   as soon as it just sort of hit me all of a sudden.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.000]   And I just dropped to my knees, and I thought of Romans 12, 1, "I appeal to you by the
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.600]   mercies of God to present your bodies as a living sacrifice."
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.960]   And I remember saying, "God, I've done this before, but I've never understood Your mercy,
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.560]   Your grace as I do right now."
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.440]   And so that was it.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.680]   Again, chronologically, the next great truth that I learned was the necessity of preaching
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.400]   the gospel to myself every day, of learning to look to Christ as my righteousness rather
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.040]   than to my own performance.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:09.240]   And then I think the next one, I had in my early Christian life, I'd gone from the extreme,
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.640]   one extreme, what I call self-effort, this is what the Bible says, "Just obey it," to
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.480]   the opposite extreme, "You can't do anything.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.320]   You just trust Jesus to live His life through you."
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.440]   These are two ditches you want to stay out of.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.360]   And after wrestling through both of those, the Lord opened my eyes from the Scriptures
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.640]   to see that what the Bible teaches is what I call dependent responsibility.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.160]   I am responsible to deal with sin.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.240]   I am responsible to grow in the fruit of the Spirit, but I'm dependent on the enabling
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.080]   power of Christ through the Holy Spirit to enable me to do that.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.640]   And then I would say the last significant thing that I would want to say to them, and
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.320]   I'd have to work out the sequence in which I would do this, and it probably would depend
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.160]   on tailoring it to their situation.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.920]   But the last one that I've learned is an increased awareness of our dependence upon the Holy
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:20.160]   Spirit and the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives, both as the one who is the director
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.880]   of our Christian growth.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.800]   Just as an athletic team needs a coach, so we need the Holy Spirit to coach us, to point
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.920]   out our weaknesses, to help us, so He gives us direction.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.600]   Then He works in us Himself.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.480]   The technical term is monergistic, which means He works by Himself apart from our input.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.400]   And then He also works synergistically, which means He enables us to work.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:55.680]   And I would say in the last couple of years of my own life, thinking now 63 years, that
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.520]   an increased awareness in my absolute dependence on and my appreciation for the work of the
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.600]   Holy Spirit has been that.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.760]   So I would say those are the great truths I've learned.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:16.920]   And I see no reason why a new Christian cannot at least begin to learn these right up front.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.260]   There's no point in having to work through 50 years of difficult experience like I had
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.680]   to do, just give it all right up front, in small doses of course, just like you go to
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.640]   school and you're taught to read and then you're taught to count and then you get into
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.500]   fractions and things like that.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:42.360]   So I really think that what I, and I've tried to do this in my books, is to help people
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.280]   to learn some of these great truths early on so they don't have to make all the mistakes
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.280]   that I made.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:56.160]   There's an old, I think it's a German proverb, "Too soon old, too late smart."
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.560]   I think that describes my Christian life.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.720]   But I think it doesn't have to be that way.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.720]   That's right.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.120]   Unless you're German like me, we learn very slowly.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.120]   Yes.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.120]   Well, that is wonderful.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.120]   Thank you for your testimony.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.240]   Thank you for the model that you give this younger generation of a man who is willing
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.640]   to learn all throughout life, willing to grow, willing to preach the gospel to himself every
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.640]   day.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.560]   You're quite a model, and I'm very grateful to God for you.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   Well, it's all by His grace, as you know.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.600]   Paul says, "But by the grace of God, I am what I am."
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:34.360]   That was bestselling author Jerry Bridges talking with me back in the fall of 2011.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.200]   Jerry passed away today at the age of 86.
