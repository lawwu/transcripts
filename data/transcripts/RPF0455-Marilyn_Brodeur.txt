[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.720]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.800]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.880]   Financial freedom often involves figuring out how to integrate the finances and the family life.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.800]   And today I've invited Dr. Marilyn Broderon.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.720]   She is the founder of the Infant Dental Center and she is going to share with us a little bit about her journey to that business.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.960]   Welcome, Marilyn, to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.200]   Hey, Joshua. Thanks for having me. I'm excited to be here.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:14.920]   So you reached out to me after a show that I did, a Q&A show, in which a listener called in and said that she was conflicted over whether or not she should continue her professional education at the master's level,
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.640]   or whether she should put that on hold in order to be able to spend more time with her child.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.840]   And you had some great commentary on that and had, you know, you've worked through that same challenge of decision yourself.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.720]   So I wanted to invite you on to share your story.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.720]   So share with us a little bit about your story, especially as it relates to finances and your family.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.720]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:47.200]   You know, when you were doing that Q&A, I was riding in the, I was driving in my car and I was literally screaming out loud at the girl.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.920]   Like, I was so, I was so, I felt so passionate about this.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:02:03.040]   So, yeah, to answer your question about, you know, finances and family, I don't feel like those need to be mutually exclusive entities.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.720]   Like, you need to, you can only choose one or the other, or you have to sacrifice a lot of family time to have decent finances.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.720]   Like, that doesn't need to be the case.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.720]   So, yeah.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.720]   What did I say that got you so upset?
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.440]   It wasn't anything that you said.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.680]   It was just her way of thinking.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.280]   And I totally see where she's coming from, where she was thinking, you know, it has to be a one or the other.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:43.040]   The Q&A was about a girl who's living in Hawaii and she didn't know, and she couldn't finish her master's program.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.360]   And I was thinking in my head, you have a small child and you live in Hawaii.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.760]   Like, go just live in Hawaii and be with your child and enjoy that time.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.520]   And it's okay to push pause on things and then start back up again.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.480]   So, I actually thought you gave really, really excellent, excellent insights.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.840]   So, tell us your story.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.920]   Have you always felt that family and finances didn't have to be in conflict?
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.840]   You know, I think I always wanted to feel that way, but I wasn't quite sure how to make that work.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.520]   I was always a very precocious child.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.960]   I told people when I was 10 that I wanted to be a neurosurgeon.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:32.720]   And then I had a mid or quarter life crisis when I was 13 and realized that to become a neurosurgeon,
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.480]   you don't have to have so many years of schooling afterwards.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.480]   And I come from a large family.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.240]   I'm the oldest of five kids.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.920]   And I loved living it.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.320]   I loved being a part of my large family.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.040]   And I didn't know how I would be able to make that work, how I would be able to be,
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.440]   how I would be able to have a mom and have this really rewarding family life
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.840]   and also be able to pursue professional things that I was interested in.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.280]   So, that was always something I was thinking about.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.080]   How do I make that balance work?
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.080]   And one of the things that I did was I graduated from high school when I was 17.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.920]   And I got, as soon as I got accepted into college, I promptly got the course catalog
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.280]   and I mapped out my whole college career because I wanted to be able to graduate in three years.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.440]   So, within the parameters and with good course selection, I was able to do that.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.240]   So, I graduated from college when I was 20 and I had also gotten accepted into dental
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.680]   school right upon graduation.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.640]   So, from all my calculations, I was going to be 24 when I graduated from dental school.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.120]   And I did.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:53.280]   So, yeah, my approach was I want to get finished with my schooling as soon as possible so that
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.960]   then I can figure out this work-life balance.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.800]   - What did you do after school?
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:08.080]   - I did a residency program for, you know, unfortunately, I was actually only able to
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:15.600]   do it for nine months because nine months into my residency program, I got disabled.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.280]   So, it was interesting.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:24.560]   We were in a conference and someone was doing a lecture when all of a sudden I felt like
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.000]   I was going to pass out.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.200]   And I wasn't pregnant.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.840]   I was, you know, there was no reason for that to happen.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.760]   It just kind of came on all of a sudden.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.240]   And it actually turned out to be a quite serious medical condition that it wasn't going to
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.280]   affect my lifespan or anything.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.320]   It was just extremely, extremely debilitating.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:51.120]   So, at 25 years old, I found myself disabled and unable to work.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.360]   And I was actually out on disability for about three, four years.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.000]   You know, so it was interesting.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.160]   I was surrounded in this very like hyper competitive environment.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.560]   I was actually a resident at Johns Hopkins Hospital, which, you know, an incredible institution
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.480]   and lots of really incredible smart people.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.440]   And I was in this environment and then all of a sudden everything stopped.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.920]   - Right.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.840]   - And it was a very introspective and almost like a very spiritual time for me because
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.800]   I had to really identify what made me, what made me me, what was actually important.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:41.600]   Because this identity of being a hospital-based practicing dentist, that wasn't something
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.880]   that I was anymore.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.400]   My body physically couldn't do it.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.440]   - Wow.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.960]   So, after a few years, you recovered.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.280]   And is that when you started your specialist practice?
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.800]   - Yeah, yeah, it was.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.560]   So, we figured out all the health stuff and I had a child.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.720]   And in that timeframe, actually becoming a mom, I learned about my niche that I practice
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:06.880]   in.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.520]   So, I do a laser procedure on babies for having difficulty feeding.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.560]   And it was funny, actually.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.160]   So, it's interesting that becoming a mom actually was very helpful for me professionally because
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.320]   I was able to understand from the patient side, from the mom's side, of being able to
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.080]   feed a baby who's having difficulties, what that feels like.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.760]   And my lactation consultant actually suggested that I start a practice like this.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:40.080]   But at the time she suggested it, we were about to make a move across the country.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.600]   I had a three-month-old.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.920]   My husband was about to start residency.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.720]   I'm like, I'm in no position to even think about this.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.760]   That's a cute idea.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.760]   But no, I still need some time to figure out my place right now.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:03.200]   But when my son was about a year and a half old, that's when I started to really think
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:03.680]   about that.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.800]   I was to the point where I felt like I hit my stride as a new mother.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.880]   And in our family life with my husband in residency, I was starting to get a little
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.680]   bored and wanted to be able to use my time and my skills.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.920]   So I started thinking about what I could do.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.240]   And that comment from my lactation consultant kept coming back to me.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.720]   So when your son was a year and a half old, then you began your specialist practice.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.520]   And your area of practice is you perform a laser surgery.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.040]   It's called phrenectomy, is that right?
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.400]   Uh-huh, yep.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:47.440]   So this for children, infants who are tongue-tied, then you perform this laser surgery that frees
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:53.040]   their tongues, which allows them to feed successfully and allows them to latch properly to their
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.000]   mother's breasts.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.240]   So without this surgery, the mother would most likely be unable to breastfeed their
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.120]   child.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.320]   Is that an accurate summary?
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.520]   And sometimes the severity depends.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.240]   Some babies are able to get by breastfeeding.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.840]   In my estimation, the biggest benefit of this is that it makes the breastfeeding experience
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.040]   so much smoother.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.840]   Which is a big deal.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:28.480]   As a father, I will affirm that that is an incredibly important, if you can make breastfeeding
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.400]   not a big deal, that is a hugely valuable service that you provide.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.840]   Oh my gosh, it's the best.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.800]   I get emails from families who are saying, "Oh, I have a completely new baby.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.720]   We're really being able to enjoy our newborn."
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:47.120]   And as someone who really values family time, this newborn period can be so fleeting.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:53.600]   So if there's something to be done to make it more, where you can really savor those
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.080]   moments with your baby, it's the best.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.120]   Standard advice that I give, and since a massive percentage of my audience is male, I'll give
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:01.760]   it here.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:08.240]   A standard of advice that I give to prospective parents, people who are expecting their first
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:16.320]   child, as I say, there's so much emphasis placed on having a healthy, successful birthing
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:16.800]   experience.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.600]   A lot of people have gone and educated themselves extensively about all their different options,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:29.760]   especially among many new mothers who have studied a lot of the different details.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.360]   They know exactly what they want.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.560]   And so when my wife and I had our first baby, we felt very well prepared for the birthing
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.120]   experience.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.760]   But nobody told me that the birth wasn't all there was.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.440]   And all of a sudden, facing those first few days with all the challenges of breastfeeding,
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.880]   it blindsided me.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.800]   And we felt woefully unprepared for that.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.280]   And so that's become my standard piece of advice, is to say that, yes, do your homework
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.960]   on the birthing experience, but you should also make sure that you prepare, at least
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.320]   mentally prepare, that it's not necessarily all roses and butterflies from there on out.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.000]   >> Oh, absolutely.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.680]   You know, one of the pieces of advice I give to my postpartum moms is, you know, breastfeeding
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:21.600]   is a very natural thing, but it is not something that is naturally ingrained in us.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.440]   It's still a learned skill.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.000]   It's something that the baby and the mom needs to learn how to do.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.560]   So and it's okay if they're struggling.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.280]   >> No question.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.600]   >> That's part of the process.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.600]   >> It can be.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.800]   >> Yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:43.920]   So in your commentary, connecting back, lest this become the lactation consultancy show,
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:49.920]   which is not the, although I am educated on the subject due to my desire to be a good
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.640]   father, it's not a specialty that I desire to teach others about.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.000]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.640]   >> So back to how this relates to finances.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:04.880]   As I understand it, this business provides for you an ability to earn a healthy income
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:11.280]   while also giving you a significant amount of flexibility and timing flexibility because
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.680]   it's your own practice, because it's somewhat versatile.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:21.280]   And this allows you to be extremely involved in the care for your son rather than needing
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.560]   to hire all those services out.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.200]   Is that accurate?
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.160]   >> Yep.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.200]   >> So tell us more.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.760]   >> Absolutely.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:33.280]   Yeah, there's so many great things with having my own business.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.200]   So I actually worked with a business counselor when I initially had this idea.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.440]   I was actually in Milan.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:46.000]   I'm a travel hacker and we had a bunch of credit card and airline miles.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.960]   And we were staying in this really nice hotel in Milan and like, wow, your life doesn't
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.800]   have to be, there don't have to be as many barriers as you think there are in your life.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.760]   Like if I could stay here, maybe I could do something else crazy.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.200]   Maybe I could start my own business.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.640]   So I worked with a business counselor to flesh out all of the details.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:10.080]   I kind of had a model of about how much money I thought I could make, how expensive all of my
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.800]   different supplies would be.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:18.640]   And as I worked with the business counselor, it was starting to look like I would be working
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.400]   maybe three to five hours a week, clinical time.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:30.080]   And when I sat down with her and we made all of these spreadsheets and came up with the
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:36.720]   different insurances, I would need the equipment, the upkeep, all employees, all of the different
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.520]   things I would need.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.840]   I remember there was this moment I looked up at her and I asked her, I'm like, is this
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.560]   even allowed?
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.840]   Is this okay?
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.720]   Is this really okay for me to do this?
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.320]   And she said, Marilyn, yeah, of course you can do this.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.920]   This is your life.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:58.400]   If you want to, if your priority at this time is you want to be able to have more time with
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.480]   your child and you don't want to work full time, that's okay.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.960]   The numbers are working out.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.760]   So that's what I did.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.720]   - Well, it shows the benefit of having a high hourly wage.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:17.120]   Always recognizing that there are only three things that you can coordinate that are going
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.720]   to control the outcome of your income, the number of hours that you work, the amount
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.560]   of work that you output per hour, and the value in the marketplace of the output of
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.280]   your work.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:32.640]   And so you've invested up front a tremendous number of hours of study, preparation, and
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.440]   professional training in order to be able to command a very high hourly wage, which
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.000]   opens up tremendous possibilities for you.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.840]   And that's absolutely fantastic.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.680]   - Yeah, you know, there was a lot of market research that I did.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:51.360]   I was on some Facebook groups where other women had gone to different professionals
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.040]   all across the US.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.000]   And so I had an idea of what the fee was, you know, across different states.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.480]   And when I started putting all of the pieces together of how much it would cost for me
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:10.800]   to get all my equipment, all the supplies that were needed, I realized, like, I would
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:17.440]   be making a decent profit, especially in a setting where I did not have huge overhead
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.240]   from a dental office, you know.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.760]   In my practice, I do not have dental plumbing.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.360]   I do not have an x-ray unit.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.800]   I don't have dental chairs.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:33.120]   I don't have a lot of things that really can cut into the profit margin in a regular office
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.520]   setting.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:38.240]   I was really able to pare down to exactly what I needed to be able to provide a good
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.400]   service to the families that I see.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.800]   - Do you have staff?
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.880]   - I do, I do.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:50.000]   Yeah, so because this is such a part-time, this is such part-time work that I do, like
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.160]   for instance, this week, I'm in my office six hours seeing babies this week.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:04.560]   And I always need to have an assistant with me as I do the procedure to help stabilize
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.200]   the baby's head and swaddle them and whatnot.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.760]   And I actually use college students.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.200]   So I have two pre-dental students who are my assistants.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.360]   It's really wonderful for them because the schedule, it's not a high amount of time that
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.240]   they need to commit.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:23.200]   And it's also a really good learning experience for them, especially as they're going to
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.360]   try for dental school.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.480]   - So let me clarify.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.280]   So you do need dental assistance during the surgery.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.840]   But beyond that, one of the potential benefits I could see of your business is that because
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:40.000]   your marketing is exclusive on one specific niche, you're not going to be fielding generalized
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.080]   telephone calls, which means it opens up that either you could probably answer your phone
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:49.840]   yourself or just simply have a very, a contracted answering service.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:55.200]   And you don't need to handle office staff for customer inquiries and things like that.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:55.840]   Is that accurate?
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:04.640]   So I do have one, I have a virtual assistant who does do some of that admin work and she
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.280]   will answer phone calls for me, especially if I'm on vacation or if I'm away for a while.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:15.040]   I am actually the one who answers all, most, the majority of the phone calls I answer myself.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:21.920]   'Cause like you said, all of the inquiries are from new mothers who have questions about
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.280]   their baby being tongue-tied.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:29.840]   I don't, and it was an interesting switch in the beginning, I was so nervous about building
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.440]   up my patient base that anytime the phone rang, I had to drop everything I was doing
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.360]   and answer the phone.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.400]   Now I'm to the point where I'll answer, I'll return phone calls once a day.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.400]   So I'll block off maybe a half an hour, an hour every day.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.960]   And I call and talk to the families directly, which I've actually found has been really
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.520]   great, a really great practice builder for me.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:57.680]   Most times when you call to schedule an appointment, you're talking to a receptionist who probably
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.560]   is familiar with the procedure maybe, but they probably don't work around it.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:08.240]   Whereas when I call these moms back, a lot of times I can answer a lot of really detailed
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.040]   questions for them.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.640]   I can put their mind at ease.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.160]   And I also have a really low no-show rate as well.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.320]   That can be a big problem in medical offices, people just not showing up to their appointments.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:24.400]   But because people are talking to me, the doctor directly, they know that if they don't
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.760]   come, they know who it is that they're putting out in that setting.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.240]   So…
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.840]   That's fantastic.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.360]   Yeah, it works really well.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.560]   Now you built this business starting in a new city where you and your husband had just
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.520]   moved to.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.440]   How did you market and start to establish yourself in the new location?
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.920]   Yeah, so I…
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.600]   That's a good question.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:56.960]   I knew of breastfeeding support groups and I was actually breastfeeding my own child
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.520]   at the time.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.880]   So I went to one of them.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.200]   I also knew different midwives and lactation consultants.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.240]   I reached out to them, just introduced myself.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.800]   Because my husband's also a physician, I know other physicians in the area.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.480]   So I know some pediatricians.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:19.600]   And once they found out about my services, this isn't something that a lot of pediatricians
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.720]   are super familiar with.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:26.960]   So if they had a baby where they had a question about it, they would send the babies to me
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.200]   for evaluations and treatment if needed.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:37.600]   A lot of it ended up being through Facebook mom support groups.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.880]   You have to go where your clients are.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:46.960]   So a lot of moms get respite from going on Facebook and kind of talking to each other
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.880]   about their day or what's going on.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.240]   Adult communication.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.480]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.200]   Exactly.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:59.040]   And in those groups, sometimes people would tag me or they're like, "Oh, you should go
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.000]   to her.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.960]   She's really great."
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.800]   And then the more I started seeing mothers, the more word of mouth got out with what a
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.480]   valuable service this can be.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.880]   And in fact, it's funny, I was telling you about that national Facebook group.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.960]   They have a preferred providers list.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.880]   And I ended up getting on that list.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.360]   And from that, so I live in Corpus Christi, Texas.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.120]   It's about three hours south of Houston.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.880]   And from that, I've had families travel from as far away as New Mexico, Louisiana.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:35.600]   Routinely, I'll have people come travel to see me from within a three-hour radius of
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.320]   where I am.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.120]   So people know about me.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.760]   Well, so I'm going to draw a couple of business lessons for the broader audience, things that
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.840]   I observe in your story.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:56.080]   First and foremost, I don't think that this topic is or should be restricted in the context
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:01.280]   of stay-at-home mothering or specifically in terms of moms versus dads.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:06.240]   I think it's rather obvious that babies have a much bigger need for mom during the early
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.480]   years, but that doesn't mean that dad doesn't need to be involved.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.000]   And this has been my vision all the way through.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.680]   In order to be able to produce the type of family that my wife and I dream of, it requires
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.320]   a lot more active approach.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.280]   And all of us make this choice every single day.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.680]   All of us make the choice to be engaged in the jobs and the businesses and the careers
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.520]   that we are involved in.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:36.800]   And in terms of is there a choice that has to be made, mutually exclusive choice between
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:42.000]   finances and family, on the one hand, no, there doesn't have to be a mutually exclusive
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.320]   choice.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.200]   They're not necessarily opposed to one another.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.680]   But on the other hand, yes, there are ways of earning money that are going to conflict
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.600]   with working as a family.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.720]   There's no chance in the world you're going to get me to sign up to be a politician at
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.840]   this stage of my family's life.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.760]   There's no chance that you're going to get me to sign up as the CEO of a publicly traded
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.640]   corporation.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:08.720]   I mean, you cannot function in those environments on any kind of reasonable work schedule, and
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.200]   you are at the mercy of your boards of directors or other people.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.120]   And so if you desire to have flexibility and freedom, you're going to have to make
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:17.760]   different choices.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.440]   Doesn't mean you got to be broke, but it does mean you have to make different choices.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:28.560]   And one of the tremendous benefits that we face, as we record this in 2017, is it's never
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.440]   been easier to set up a specialized cottage industry, so to speak.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.960]   And cottage industry doesn't mean you have to make soap in your kitchen and sell it for
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.240]   a dollar a bar.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.040]   I mean, that's great.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.680]   People do well with making soap, but you can make soap or you can slice babies' tongues
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.640]   as they should be sliced with a laser and make a little bit more than a dollar per ton.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.120]   So that's the benefit that we face.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:58.720]   And from a business perspective, by choosing a very focused, very tight specialty, you
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.440]   can turn the marketing machine to work for you.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:08.000]   If you were just a general dentist, if you were one of many, then the only basis of your
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.520]   referability is the fact that, yes, you're a nice dentist and you are effective at what
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.480]   you're doing and your pricing.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.880]   And so you're in a world of commodities where you have commodity-based pricing and it's
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.520]   very, very challenging to differentiate yourself.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.880]   But by choosing a very small specialty, something that has personal importance to you, something
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:34.000]   in which you're going to be very effectively connecting with your patients, that opens
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.440]   up the ability to be referable.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.760]   And you don't have a ton of competition.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:46.000]   And when somebody needs your services, if we had a baby that had tongue problems and
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   we needed it to go, we would drive to Orlando, we'd drive to Tampa in an instant to get it
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.280]   done because you know you want to work with a specialist.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.640]   And that can be applied in all of our businesses.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.120]   That can be applied in financial planning.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.000]   That can be applied in investments.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.160]   That can be applied in real estate.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.000]   That can be applied in engineering.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.760]   And with the simple ability to hang out your shingle through the use of a web page and
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.960]   to market your services through a national and international Facebook group, it opens
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:18.720]   up the possibility for so many of us to follow your path, Marilyn, and enjoy some of the
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   same benefits.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.480]   - Yeah, you know, I was actually just having a conversation with a girlfriend of mine.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.360]   So complicating our family life is my husband is a ER physician.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.240]   He just finished his residency.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.160]   So his schedule's all over the place.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:38.360]   If I was working in a dental office and regular, you know, I've seen patients from eight to
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:43.760]   five every day, you know, sometimes he's off on a random Wednesday or Thursday.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.240]   I would miss those days off.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.600]   So having something that's a little more flexible is extremely important to us.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:57.200]   So anyway, one of my other friends who's married to a colleague of my husband's, she was a
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:04.800]   lawyer, and she worked for the DA, and she had these horrible daytime working hours.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.480]   When her husband was working night shifts, forget about it.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.320]   Like, they didn't see each other at all.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.600]   And she ended up quitting her job because it was just way too hard on her marriage.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:19.080]   So I was talking with her, and you know, she was talking about wanting to start up her
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.080]   own law firm.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.760]   She was interested in the building that I had gotten my office in.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.560]   She was looking into all of these things.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:32.600]   And one of the suggestions I made was, you know, why don't you, you could specialize
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.360]   your law practice to looking over physician employment contracts.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.120]   And that's all you do.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.080]   And that's something where you don't even need an office.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.600]   They can email you the contract.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.240]   You can review it at your leisure.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.560]   If your husband is off in the morning, you guys could go to the beach or go do something
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.800]   together and then review the employment contract in the afternoon when he's sleeping.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.280]   You know, like you have the flexibility to be able to do that.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:02.640]   So I'm happy to report that she's starting to look into that business model for herself,
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.680]   you know, and especially how you're talking about with these cottage industries.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.720]   What sets you apart?
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.280]   Why should someone go to you?
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.040]   For me, they should go to me because I've traveled to other dentist offices.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.240]   I've learned specifically how to do this.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.160]   I'm very comfortable treating babies with a laser.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.920]   That's not something I learned how to do in dental school.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.040]   That was something that I went out and got on my own.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:33.080]   So I am very different from any other dentist in my area because of that.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.800]   And with my friend wanting to do physician employment contracts, that's something that
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.960]   she can learn about.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.040]   She can gain the expertise to do that.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:46.200]   She can look at some of our friends and look at their contracts and see what amendments
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.960]   they were making.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:54.360]   There are ways that you can gain a skill where you can become an expert in that area.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.360]   Absolutely.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:01.240]   And you can become an expert in a relatively short period of time with study and focused
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.600]   study.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:08.440]   Most areas of expertise, some areas, for example, law, will build on a general understanding,
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.240]   a generalized legal knowledge.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:17.080]   But most areas of expertise, a few hundred hours of focused study, of diligent investigation,
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.880]   and you can become an expert.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.960]   And that becomes a huge time-saving device.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.960]   I want to point out a couple of the benefits also for your friend to spark our audience's
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.400]   thinking.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:32.200]   By having a small specialized practice like that, and she's in an ideal situation where
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.520]   she's not required to make a huge amount of money immediately.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.400]   This is one of the biggest challenges that professionals often face, is if you are required
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:49.160]   to support a high-expense family life immediately, or if you're required to support a high-expense
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:54.240]   personal life based upon your past expenses, i.e., I have $200,000 of student loans that
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.600]   are not in deferral.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.840]   This can be a real challenge to start a business because you need to make a lot of money quickly.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:06.800]   And generally, specialty businesses are going to be slower in the beginning.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.920]   You could go and make more money working as a dentist just if you just go right into the
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:16.360]   mainstream approach than if you start with having a series of small referrals because
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.140]   referrals take time.
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.800]   But on the backside, you can cut so much in expenses.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.360]   You can cut out the need to maintain an office.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:30.560]   And in most metropolitan areas like mine or probably like Corpus Christi, just to have
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.760]   a relatively small reasonable office, if you share the space with a bunch of other people,
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.120]   you're at $1,000 a month.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.920]   If you have any kind of private space where your clients are coming in, you're at $1,500
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.140]   a month by the time you go all in and include all the extra expenses.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.800]   You can probably cut out any need for staff requirements.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:52.000]   A simple answering service or virtual assistant to help with scheduling, you can replace a
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.160]   lot of those functions.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.960]   That eliminates the need for employees.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.960]   Employees are expensive.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.080]   That eliminates the need for a lot of insurance and things like that.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:05.320]   And you can cut a few thousand dollars off of most businesses by turning them into cottage
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:10.440]   industries or "lifestyle businesses" instead of trying to be big and huge.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.080]   Well, count the hours.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.920]   Let's say that you're billing at $200, $200, $300 an hour.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.920]   Let's just use $200.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:24.400]   If you can cut $3,000 a month out of your expenses at $200 an hour, that's 15 hours
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.040]   less of work.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.400]   That's just pure expenses right off the top.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:34.160]   And so that's a huge benefit for professionals who've developed a skill and a knowledge and
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.680]   an expertise in an area.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.440]   I'd say overhead is really, really important to look at.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:47.200]   So my husband and I, we think of my overhead in terms of baby units.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:57.500]   So how many babies do I need to treat in order to meet my rent?
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:03.040]   In order to meet all of my licensing fees, my payroll?
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.760]   And I was very mustache-y about how I ended up setting up my practice.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.320]   Is this a truly necessary expense?
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.320]   Is there another way we can go around this?
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.880]   Could I have a smaller office?
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.880]   All of these things.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.000]   And that really benefited me, especially while I was starting out.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.480]   So I can share my baby unit.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:28.840]   I'm actually at about five to six baby units a month to break even.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.040]   So anything over that, I'm making profit.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.200]   That's great.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.200]   That's awesome.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.760]   Now, one of the things that you had written in your communication to me after that episode,
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:44.340]   which was 417, in which you responded, you wrote to me that you have a number of benefits
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.040]   because you do work and you do earn income.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.680]   That gives you – and yes, it's very, very flexible.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.000]   You get a lot of the benefits of being a stay-at-home mom, but you get other benefits as well.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   What are some of those benefits that you get from maintaining your medical practice?
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Yeah, so sure.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.520]   So one of them is health insurance.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:12.280]   When my husband became a grown-up doctor – he's not in residency anymore – he lost his insurance.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.040]   He became an independent contractor.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.360]   We had to get insurance ourselves.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.520]   And through the Obamacare marketplace, the insurance in Texas was horrible.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:24.400]   You could only get HMOs.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.720]   Especially considering my health problems, if I need to go to the doctor, I wanted to
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.040]   be able to have strong coverage.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:37.920]   And because I had a business and I have W-2 employees, I was actually able to qualify
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:45.160]   for a group insurance through a PPO because of the structure of my business.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.920]   And then I'm also able to pay the insurance premiums through the income that I earn from
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.120]   my business as well.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.640]   So that's a really great thing for a family.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.680]   I'm also able to contribute to retirement plans.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:06.320]   So now that my husband has started earning real doctor money, we've bumped up in our
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.320]   tax bracket.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:11.640]   So the name of the game right now for us in our situation is we want to put as much money
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.600]   into tax-deferred accounts as possible.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:22.120]   And because he's able to put money into a SEP IRA, I've been putting money into a SEP
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:28.400]   IRA, but now I'm starting an individual 401(k) so I can contribute an additional $18,000
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.120]   every year on top.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:35.840]   So anyway, it just overall is a really great situation for a family with tax deferrals.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:43.800]   I can also write off my cell phone, our internet service, a lot of other things, our business
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.800]   expenses that I can write off.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:53.520]   And especially being in a higher tax bracket, that's a pretty huge savings because our after-tax
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.320]   money is like 30%.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:02.880]   You have to take off like 30% of whatever we have to get to our after-tax dollars.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.800]   So anything we can be writing off free tax is saving us money.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.680]   That's fantastic.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.200]   How about the flip side?
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.720]   Have you had any regrets along this journey?
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:20.920]   Is there anything that because of your decision to pursue building this practice and not to
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.840]   stay exclusively as a stay-at-home mom, have you had any regrets or disadvantages from
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.840]   this path?
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:35.720]   In the motherhood aspect, not so much.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:40.160]   Occasionally I have some mom guilt because I have to do admin activities and my son was
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:46.600]   watching Rescue Box a little longer than I would have liked.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:53.680]   But on the motherhood front, really not so much because it is a fairly limited time that
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:58.200]   we need somebody to be watching our kids or we need someone to be here.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:04.800]   Professionally, I do deal with a little bit of regret.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:09.160]   What I was trained to do in dental school, I don't do any of that.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.800]   I haven't done a root canal in six years.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.360]   I haven't done a denture filling.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.840]   I don't do any of that anymore.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.640]   I haven't picked up a drill in years.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:24.280]   And so for some, it can seem like this was a waste of education because I spent four
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:30.600]   years and then an additional year in my residency program developing expertise in that.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.200]   But I don't see it that way.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:39.800]   I see that it's almost like that time was necessary to get my professional credentialing
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.640]   so that I'm a licensed dentist.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:47.080]   But that's almost like that time is a sunk cost.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:54.440]   I do have no desire to do those procedures anymore, so I don't.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.800]   I think our society is going to try to put mom guilt on you no matter what you do.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   Yeah, right.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.800]   There's always that.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:06.880]   You can never be good enough to match up with all the moms on Pinterest.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.880]   Right, right.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.320]   And that's okay.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.880]   One of the benefits, just a couple things that occurred to me that I was kind of expecting
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.920]   you to say, one of the benefits I would imagine is that by maintaining your professional work,
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.480]   it does give you more opportunity to continue adult conversations.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.480]   I think that's a huge benefit.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.640]   Oh, very much so.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:33.680]   One of the biggest costs for full-time mothers is often that their adult interaction can
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.400]   become so diminished, and that's a huge, huge cost.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.480]   And now my wife and I have to work constantly at it to make sure that there's lots of adult
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.480]   interaction for her.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.920]   And so I've got to imagine that's a big benefit for you.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:53.440]   Yeah, there is something nice to being ... Women, we're multidimensional.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.160]   We have that motherhood hat that we put on, but then it's also nice to be able to have
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.320]   this professional hat that I put on.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:07.360]   I can speak very intelligently about the different peer-reviewed journals on ankyloglossia and
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.360]   tongue-tie.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.480]   I can talk about laser physics to concerned parents.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:18.480]   I've been invited to speak at the local children's hospital at different events, talking about
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.480]   breastfeeding.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.840]   And it's nice to be able to use my brain in a different way.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.840]   Absolutely.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.840]   Is there anything I've missed?
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.880]   Anything you'd like to share with my audience?
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.960]   You've got the soapbox.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.280]   Anything you'd like to share as we wrap up?
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.280]   Oh, goodness.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:36.480]   I should have thought about ... I should have just thought about my soapbox more.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:45.040]   Well, I will say when starting a practice or a firm or a business of this sort, there's
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:52.240]   always the element of having no idea if it will actually work or not.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:56.760]   And having that fear is completely normal.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:03.000]   You have to build up the courage and decide, "You know what?
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.520]   I'm going to expend X amount of dollars."
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.520]   And for me, I actually had a time limit.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.520]   I had a year.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:15.200]   I was going to really dedicate a year of my extra brainpower to building this practice.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.640]   And if it didn't work ... And after a year, I would reevaluate.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.800]   If it didn't work, I could walk away and I wouldn't feel bad about it.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.840]   I knew I had given it a good try.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:30.040]   So it's okay to feel scared or nervous about doing this.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:34.120]   And that's part of the joy.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:37.560]   Now I'm two and a half years into this and my practice definitely works.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.480]   And it's a really beautiful situation for our family.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:47.560]   I think almost all of us who've started a business spend some amount of our ... There's
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.560]   a quote.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.560]   I can't come up with it.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:56.120]   Along the lines of, "50% of your time is spent in a euphoric state, just so excited about
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.800]   how rich you're going to be and how great your life is going to be, just absolute euphoria.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.160]   The other 50% has spent in absolute terror."
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.760]   And they cycle back and forth pretty consistently.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.760]   Oh yeah.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.760]   Oh yeah.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.760]   I definitely went through all of those changes.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.240]   Oh, and one other thing I thought of.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:19.120]   So I'm still in close contact with a lot of my classmates from dental school.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:23.640]   And a lot of them are in the throes of having their own general dentistry practice or their
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.640]   specialty practices.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.640]   And they have a career.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.120]   They have everything set up.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.040]   And I don't.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.480]   My life doesn't look that way.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:41.360]   It's okay for your life to look different than your peers do.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:47.920]   Sometimes I feel like your career is this sacred priority that you have to do what's
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.440]   good for your career.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.080]   You have to make this move because it's good for your career.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.840]   Do this thing because it's good for your career.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:00.400]   Sometimes it's okay to do things that's good for you as a person, that's good for you as
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:08.720]   a mom, good for you as a wife, good for you as a human being who likes to go to the beach.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:13.240]   It's okay to give yourself permission to make decisions in that capacity.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.920]   I've got to imagine your husband's a big encouragement to you there.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.740]   I know my wife is for me because I've made many decisions.
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:27.540]   And I've often felt the same thing as I've left the career path, the normal career path
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:31.680]   of working as a financial advisor and gone in other directions.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:36.280]   I know that I've faced so many decisions where I've said, "Wait a second.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.840]   This is going to cause me to be looked down upon.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.280]   This is going to cause me not to be the big hot shot that I could have been.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.120]   I know I'm walking away from this notoriety and this public acclaim.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:49.840]   And I know I'm walking away from this particular career benefit."
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:54.020]   And I so value she's so good at saying, "Just hold on a second.
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:58.460]   Why are you doing what you're doing and are you focusing on your design or are you trying
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.320]   to live somebody else's dream?"
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   Right, right.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:08.600]   Yeah, as an anecdote, my husband went to University of Maryland for medical school.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:14.280]   And there's a thing in March called Match Day where everyone in front of their whole
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:18.920]   medical school reads where they're going for residency.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:27.060]   And so I was there at Match Day and there were a lot of very like sexy sounding places
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:32.380]   that people were going like Yale and Harvard and UPenn and all of these like really incredible
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.520]   residency programs.
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:41.660]   And you're picked based off of your ranking that the program ranks you and also that the
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:45.380]   student ranks the program and then there's a computerized match.
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:51.620]   And my husband got up there and he read Corpus Christi, Christus Spahn Medical Center and
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:59.620]   all these people in Baltimore, they're like, "Oh, I wonder if that's a low priority."
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:03.420]   He got matched really low down on his rank list or something.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.780]   But Corpus Christi was actually our number one choice.
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.620]   And it was our number one choice because it's by the beach.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:17.580]   He ended up getting the residency program, how they structure it was very family friendly.
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:20.300]   They get excellent training.
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.300]   They do a ton of procedures.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.020]   It was an all around really great program.
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:30.420]   The only quote unquote negative about it was that nobody had really heard of it.
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:33.180]   And it was out in the middle of nowhere.
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:37.580]   And as we were making our rank list, I remember looking at him and we were talking about it.
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:44.180]   I'm like, "We don't owe anyone anything as far as on our resume, we need to look a certain
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.180]   way."
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.180]   It doesn't matter.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.980]   If this fits with our family, that's what we need to do.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.900]   And as your virtual financial advisor, it warms my heart.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:58.860]   Texas, growing economy, not a dying economy like many other places, no state income taxes,
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.300]   low cost of living.
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.300]   It's a great place.
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.300]   I know, I know.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:04.300]   We love growing income taxes.
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:08.300]   Well, Marilyn, thank you for coming on the show.
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:13.420]   I appreciate your sharing your story and I hope that it serves as inspiration to so many
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:18.860]   other people listening that you can sit down and you can take an inventory of your skills
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:24.000]   and your abilities and you can design an opportunity that'll help you to fit your life goals while
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.540]   also meeting your financial goals such that your highest priorities, whatever they be,
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:32.260]   can be fulfilled and finances and family both included in that.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.260]   So thank you for coming on today.
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.260]   Thank you for having me, Joshua.
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:40.900]   Yeah, I hope this helps spur some thinking in someone else who's listening.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:44.440]   And I forgot your website is infantdentalcenter.com.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:52.700]   So if anybody in the Texas or surrounding region and has a child with tongue tie or
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.660]   what's the other name of the other condition?
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.660]   Tongue tie or what?
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.820]   Ankle colosseum is the medical term for it.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.940]   That would be hilarious if somebody came to my practice because they listen to me a lot
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:03.940]   of the time.
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:04.940]   You never know.
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:05.940]   There's probably lots of crunchy.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.340]   My wife and I are pretty crunchy these days.
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:10.860]   There's probably lots of crunchy listeners who are looking for services like yours.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.860]   I love it.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.860]   I love it.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:13.860]   Thanks, Marilyn.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:14.860]   Call me.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:19.940]   I'd be happy to talk to you about your breastfeeding challenges.
