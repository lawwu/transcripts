[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.420]   As we go from Sunday to Sunday, I have been looking at some of the interesting conversations
[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.380]   that our Lord had out of the four gospels.
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:23.640]   And we come to one this morning that I think you're familiar with as a story, but it provides
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.920]   for us a very, very important emphasis that I want everybody to understand.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.920]   The text is Mark, chapter 2, Mark, chapter 2.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:47.140]   And the chapter opens with this familiar story about the man being let down through the roof
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.900]   into the presence of Jesus.
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.620]   And what ensued is a result of that.
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.860]   It's a result of that appearance.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.740]   But let me read beginning in verse 1 down to verse 12, so you have the story in mind.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:11.640]   "When he," meaning Jesus, "had come back to Capernaum several days afterward, it was
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.620]   heard that he was at home.
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.760]   And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room, not even near the door,
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.600]   and he was speaking the word to them.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.220]   And they came bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men.
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.480]   Being unable to get to him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.660]   when they had dug an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying.
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:49.900]   And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, 'Son, your sins are forgiven.'
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.580]   But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.820]   'Why does this man speak this way?
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.280]   He is blaspheming.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.700]   Who can forgive sins but God alone?'"
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.700]   Immediately Jesus, aware in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves,
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.020]   said to them, 'Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.560]   Which is easier to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.480]   pick up your pallet and walk?'
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.640]   But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, He
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.280]   said to the paralytic, 'I say to you, get up, pick up your pallet, and go home.'
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.460]   And he got up and immediately picked up the pallet and went out in the sight of everyone,
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.540]   so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God, saying, 'We have never seen anything.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.580]   We have never seen anything like this.'"
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.460]   To introduce this, I want to pose a question to you: What is the most distinctive benefit
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.820]   that Christianity offers?
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.980]   If you were to do a man-on-the-street survey in our modern culture and ask people in some
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:23.520]   random fashion what they think the message of Christianity really is, you would be surprised
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.320]   I think if you found somebody who got the right answer, because there are so many viewpoints
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.480]   of Christianity.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.540]   Some think it is some kind of a moral form of political ideology.
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:45.940]   Some people think it is rules so that you can live the kind of life that God will accept.
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.200]   Some people think it's purpose.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.500]   Christianity is to give purpose to your life.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.500]   It's to frame up your life.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.940]   It's to frame up your life with some significant goal and objective.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.700]   Some people think Christianity is to provide love in the heart so that we can counter the
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.940]   hatred in the world.
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.560]   Some people think that Christianity's goal and objective is peace.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.480]   There are some who think that Christianity basically is a form of social responsibility,
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.480]   family love, and its design is to bring about peace.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.200]   Some people think that Christianity is to bring about moral change in society.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:36.800]   Some people think its basic existence is to provide personal fulfillment, personal happiness,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.420]   personal peace and joy, and that's a rare thing in the world in which we live.
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.940]   Well, the truth of the matter is none of those is the right answer.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.460]   There is one benefit that transcends all other realities.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.360]   There is one benefit that directly corresponds to man's greatest need.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.760]   And that is important to say.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:09.420]   Whatever man's greatest need is, Christianity must respond to that need.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.560]   That is precisely what it does.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.840]   So what is man's greatest need?
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:22.180]   Let me take you over to John, chapter 8, for a moment and let you hear the answer to that
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.440]   question from the lips of God.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.020]   Let's read the letter of Jesus.
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:35.060]   John, chapter 8, verse 21: "Then He said again to them, 'I go away, and you will seek
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:42.260]   Me, and will die in your sin.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.900]   Where I am going, you cannot come.'
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.420]   He said, 'I'm going to heaven, and you're not.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.060]   You will die in your sin.
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.240]   And where I am going, you cannot come.'
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.200]   He repeated it in verse 24: 'I said to you, 'You will die in your sins.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.720]   For unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.'"
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   Three times He says, "You're going to die in your sins, and you're not going to be able
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.400]   to come to heaven unless you believe that I am He."
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.900]   And He said, "You will die in your sins, and you will be able to come to heaven unless you
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.900]   believe that I am He."
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.900]   He said, "You will die in your sins, and you will die in your sins.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.900]   You will die in your sins, and you will be able to come to heaven unless you believe
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.900]   that I am He."
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.900]   And He said, "You will die in your sins, and you will die in your sins.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.900]   You will die in your sins, and you will be able to come to heaven unless you believe
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.900]   that I am He."
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.900]   What sends people to hell?
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.900]   Not sin.
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.900]   Unforgiven sin.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.900]   Unforgiven sin.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.900]   We all sin.
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:48.000]   And we would all end up in hell if our sins were not forgiven.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.380]   This is the message of Christianity, that God through...
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:03.280]   His loving kindness has designed a way for sinners to be forgiven, and forgiven with
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.900]   such magnanimity that it could be spoken of as if it's removing your sins as far as the
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.840]   east is from the west, or burying them in the depths of the sea, or putting them behind
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.260]   His back, or remembering them no more.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.360]   What sends people to hell is unforgiven sin.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:33.100]   So the greatest need of every soul is divine forgiveness.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:38.600]   The greatest benefit that Christianity offers is just that: forgiveness.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:49.520]   Again, it is unforgiven sin that sends people into eternal punishment in hell.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.340]   Christianity answers then the compelling question: "Can I forgive?"
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.460]   Can I be forgiven?
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.660]   Can I be forgiven?
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:08.260]   And if you are giving a faithful message concerning the Christian message, the Christian truth,
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:17.400]   the Christian gospel, what you're telling people is the good news is that you can be
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.440]   forgiven.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.320]   In the thirteenth chapter of the book of Acts.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:32.700]   The apostle Paul declares this for us, down in verse 38 of Acts 13: "Therefore let it
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:42.960]   be known to you, brethren, that through Him" - that is Christ, whom God raised from the
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:51.900]   dead - "through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.300]   And through Him" - that's the word, "forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.300]   - "that through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.300]   "And through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.060]   This is the Christian message.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:33.940]   Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you can be forgiven.
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:39.800]   Listen to Ephesians 1:7: "In Him - " that is, in Christ " - we have redemption through
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:47.900]   His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of His grace."
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:53.140]   In Ephesians, chapter 4, verse 32: "God in Christ
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.320]   has forgiven you."
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.680]   First John 1:9: "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:10.300]   our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.280]   When you go into the Old Testament, you find the same thing.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:22.980]   Here are the words of Exodus 34: "The Lord God Himself said, 'The Lord, the Lord God,
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:28.400]   God is compassionate, gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in loving kindness and truth,
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:38.060]   who keeps loving kindness for thousands, who forgives iniquity, transgression, and sin.'"
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:46.340]   God is introducing Himself there, as you remember, in the mountain to Moses, and He wants Moses
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.040]   to know His character.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.820]   And He describes Himself as "compassionate, gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:11:02.100]   loving kindness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin."
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:10.220]   Nehemiah 9:17: "You are a God of forgiveness, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger,
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.060]   and abounding in loving kindness."
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:21.560]   And I read earlier, Psalm 103: "As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.660]   our transgressions."
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.220]   How far is the east from the west?
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.360]   That's an infinite line.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:38.920]   In Isaiah 38:17 it says of God, "You have cast all my sins behind Your back."
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:47.500]   Isaiah 43:25: "I, even I, am the one who wipes out Your transgressions for my own sake, and
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.500]   I will not remember Your sins."
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.500]   What an amazing message.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:59.140]   That is the message of the true and living God.
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:03.120]   That is the essence of the Christian gospel.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.720]   It's not a form of morality.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:13.120]   It's not a form of philanthropy, human goodness.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:22.340]   The gospel is the only way that you can have your sins forgiven.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.880]   That's the only way you'll escape hell.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:34.960]   In the book of Micah, the prophet in verses 18 and 19 of chapter 7, Micah 7:18 and 19:
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:41.460]   "Who is a God like You who pardons iniquity and passes over the rebellious act of the
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.540]   remnant of His possession?
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:49.580]   He does not retain His anger forever, but He delights in unchanging love.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.180]   He will again have compassion on us.
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.740]   He will tread our iniquities underfoot.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:13:03.160]   Yes, You will cast all their sins into the depth of the sea."
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.340]   What astounding generosity this is.
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.400]   And this is the Christian message.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:18.700]   This is the message that God gave in the Old Testament and in the New: He forgives sins.
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.020]   Now this raises the question of justice.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:30.400]   God understands that justice must prevail.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:39.480]   In fact, God says it's an abomination if you do something that violates justice.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:47.780]   Listen to Proverbs 17:15: "He who justifies the wicked is an abomination to the Lord."
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.860]   "He who justifies the wicked?"
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.240]   "He who justifies the wicked is an abomination to the Lord."
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:01.180]   And yet, that is exactly what God did.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:11.540]   Listen to Romans 4:5: "But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.980]   the ungodly."
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:21.700]   The very thing that Proverbs 17 says is an abomination is exactly what God does: He justifies
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.600]   the ungodly.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.660]   His faith is credited as righteousness.
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:44.340]   The sound foundational law of morality in the world is that evil must be punished and
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.740]   goodness rewarded.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.540]   But God Himself has chosen to punish.
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:57.780]   He has chosen to violate that law in the sense that He justifies the ungodly, one of
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:04.660]   the most shocking statements to Jewish people anywhere in the New Testament.
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.240]   How can God do that?
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.020]   How is it possible?
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:21.380]   And the answer is because He punishes His Son in the place of believing sinners.
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:26.020]   He punishes His Son in the place of believing sinners.
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.620]   He punishes His Son in the place of believing sinners.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.620]   He punishes His Son in the place of believing sinners.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.620]   This is the most powerful, most powerful, most powerful, most powerful, most powerful
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.620]   law of morality in the world.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.620]   And it's the most powerful law of morality in the world.
