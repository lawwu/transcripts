[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500]   All right.
[00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.700]   Let's do some habit tune-ups, Jesse.
[00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.800]   Sounds good.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.820]   So for those who don't know, a habit tune-up is a segment in which I take a
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.400]   piece of advice for my advice, Canon and walk you through it.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.300]   So today I want to talk about what I sometimes call multi-scale seasonality.
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.960]   So I've been reading a lot recently about what I sometimes think of as natural
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.240]   productivity, and what I mean by that is the way as human beings, we are wired to
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.400]   work so clearly through most of our history before culture could rapidly
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.720]   intercede with what our day-to-day lives were like, we had time for our brains
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.840]   and bodies to evolve for whatever it was we had to do to survive day to day.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.520]   And I'm really interested in what that is because it gives us some, I'm
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.160]   approaching this with care, but it gives us some notion of what our natural
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.360]   inclinations for work actually are.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.640]   So actually, as we finished recording this, Jesse, the, my research
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.880]   assistant, Caleb's coming over.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.800]   He's bringing a big stack of research he's been doing on my behalf on this topic.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.960]   So a couple hours from now, I'm about to really increase my knowledge of how, how
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.800]   did we think about work in the paleolithic?
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.480]   So one of the things though, that seems to be clear from the work I've done so far
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.600]   is that our minds are not used to this idea of being pegged at all out work
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.640]   relentlessly day after day, week after week, month after month, our natural sense
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.880]   of productivity is way more rhythmic on different scales.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.240]   There's intense periods and recharge periods.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.600]   There's up and down periods.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.960]   There's a variability to what work means.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.520]   We get frazzled.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.040]   We get this chronic background hum of anxiety when it's every single day.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.080]   Wall to wall, email, zoom, email, zoom, email, zoom, Slack, Slack, Slack, email,
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.120]   email, email, quick break, dinner, go to sleep, repeat again and again.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.200]   And again, we can handle intense situations.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.600]   We're not meant to live in that all of the time.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.280]   So one of the things I have been recommending, one of the things I've been
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.480]   experimenting with is what I call multi-scale seasonality, which is about
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.360]   inducing more breaks into your working life at different scales to give yourself
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.600]   some freedom from the sense of I'm always on.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.400]   Now at the scale of a year, most people will take vacation.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.320]   So that's good.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.560]   One or two weeks, maybe twice a year, people will take off work and that's good.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.560]   But what I want to recommend with multi-scale seasonality is that we
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.640]   replicate this at shorter timeframes.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.000]   So if possible, I would say take one day off every two months or so.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.160]   So if you, if you're in a job where you build up like a federal government job,
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.440]   where you build up a bunch of personal days and vacation days, use one once
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.320]   every two months, take that day off and don't work, do something kind of over
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.760]   the top that signals to yourself that this is a self-care relaxation type of day.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:15.280]   Next, again, if possible in your job, take one half day off every two weeks or so.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.120]   Now this I would recommend if you're in a knowledge work job, just doing unofficially.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.680]   Let you follow my advice.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.640]   You're on top of things.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.200]   You're organized, your time block planning, your multi-scale
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.280]   planning, you get your stuff done.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.320]   You can set things up so that on Friday, you're really clocking out of work at
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.040]   one 30 instead of going all the way to five, you can figure out how to basically
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.480]   do that if you're working from home, you can literally go somewhere else.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.800]   If you're working in an office, you can kind of informally shut down.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.360]   And kind of be relaxed and working something else and then leave the office
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.720]   early, a little bit earlier than normal.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.520]   So you can do this a little bit unofficially.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.720]   That's like a half day where I'm going to see a movie.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.000]   I'm going to, you know, catch a day game at the baseball stadium.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.600]   Do that every, every two weeks or so.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.640]   Look, if you're an organized person, this will have zero
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.800]   impact on how much you produce.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.600]   But it is really good for your psychology.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.280]   It's not that this adds up to a ton of time off, but psychologically, it adds
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.120]   up to regular breaks from what's going on.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.560]   You're never too far away from a half day that you're taking off out of the
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.880]   normal where you normally be working.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.960]   You're never more than a month or so away from taking a full
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.480]   day off and doing something else.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.120]   You're never six months away from taking two weeks off for a vacation.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.000]   So having breaks on multiple scales serves a really useful psychological
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.320]   trick and it gets your brain into a mode of we worked and we're off and it can
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.800]   really help short circuit that background hum of anxiety that happens if you
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.080]   feel like you're constantly pegged.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.680]   Now in the big picture, I think multi-scale seasonality can be
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.720]   way more aggressive than that.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.920]   I have a lot of thoughts about that.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.280]   I think work should be way more varied than that.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.040]   We'll get to that whole chapter.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.680]   My new book's going to be about that, but for now, this is a simple thing
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.040]   that you can do right away that will make a big difference to your psychology.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.400]   So do you practice that?
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.600]   Yeah, I practice.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.640]   Well, I practice more extreme versions, but, but I, but again, I have a very
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.640]   flexible job, I have seasons that are different than other seasons.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.280]   I'm in writing mode for three months now.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.720]   Like that's a big change.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.880]   Uh, yeah, I do weeks off and not weeks off days off on a very regular basis.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.400]   I'll do that.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.440]   Protect days way out in advance.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.160]   Um, makes a big difference.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.360]   But you still write six days a week.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.620]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.420]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.520]   So, I mean, when I'm talking about days off, it's usually from Georgetown stuff.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.260]   Yeah.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.980]   Yeah.
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.740]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.160]   Writing's on a different type of scale.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.520]   I'm working on a book for the six months and then the next six months I'm doing
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.020]   nothing.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.320]   So like writing goes back and forth on that scale.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.760]   Uh, but I'm coming to it.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.560]   This is the working at a natural pace piece of slow productivity.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.320]   This is what this is starting to get to is work should not necessarily be.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.480]   I'm just pegged seven, you know, eight, nine hours a day with a few extra checks
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.560]   after it, just, there's always stuff piled up, always stuff I'm working on anytime.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.280]   You know, I barely get away if I am, it's an issue.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.920]   We're not wired for that.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.720]   [music]
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.300]   (music)
