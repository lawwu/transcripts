[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Happy Friday and welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Listener Rachel in Cameroon writes in to ask, "Pastor John,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   we all have difficult experiences in life with respect to
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   interpersonal communication and conflict, both with fellow Christians and
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   non-Christians. Processing this with other people can lead to
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   gossip or slander, of course. Is there benefit to processing
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   these conflicts with our spouse or is this gossip and slander?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   For example, Pastor John, if you had a difficult interpersonal interaction
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   or relationship with an elder in your church, is it okay to process through that at
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   home in confidence with Noel? Is such a practice
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   helpful?" Well, it certainly can be helpful and it's
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   fraught with dangers as well. And maybe the
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   first thing I should address is just the issue of
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   permission. It is possible to
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   simply ask the person that you are
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   having difficulty with or in conflict with, permission,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   may I share this issue
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   with my spouse? Now that may seem awkward since
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   the whole issue is conflict and difficulty, and yet
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   you may be surprised because they might
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   feel respected because of the request instead of
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   you're just assuming that you're going to go talk about it with anybody you please. So
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   it might go a long way towards
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   some healing. And if you have permission, then
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I think you're free at least to consider the possibility
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   of speaking with your spouse about the situation. But
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   even then, it's not automatic, I don't think, whether
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   you should or not. There are other factors. And
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   the next thing I think of is there are two people that you need
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   to know really well in this process, and that is yourself
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   and your spouse, if you're going to discern what would be helpful
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   to talk about, what would be appropriate. And the reason I say
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   that you need to know yourself really well is
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   because even if you have a green light in every other regard
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   to share something with your spouse, your attitude
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   in doing so could be sinful.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   This is why it seems to me there are so many warnings
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   in the Bible about how we speak of other people,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   especially other Christians. Like James 4.11, "Do not
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   speak evil against one another." And 2 Corinthians
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   12.20, Paul is afraid that he'll find slander
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   and gossip and conceit and disorder in the
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   church. And I think part of the reason these texts are
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   in the Bible is to warn us that we are so
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   prone to speak about others
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   when our own attitude is the real problem.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And so we need to know ourselves really well
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   so that we don't even share the things we have permission to share
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   if our motives are impure or if we feel
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   jealousy or undue anger or sinful
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   fear and anxiety or revenge or just
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   the subtle pleasure—we all know this—the subtle pleasure
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   of sharing news, especially bad
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   news or questionable news that nobody else knows about
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   but us, and we get to be the first one to talk about it. There's something
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   not good about that desire that is in
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   us. So the watchword here is test yourself, know yourself,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   put to death any selfish motives in your
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   self before you talk about it with your spouse. And the
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   other person you need to know really well to make right decisions about when to
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   share or when to debrief is your spouse.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Will we be tempting him or her—I'll just say
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   this person, I'm talking about Noelle here—will I be tempting her
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   toward anger or resentment or fear?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   What's the emotional makeup of our spouse? Do we know
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   her? Is our spouse vulnerable to certain kinds of
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   sin which she might
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   get sucked into in the relational conflict? Or is
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   our spouse strong enough and able to
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   give us good counsel without becoming embroiled in
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   the situation to her own detriment? So
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   knowing our spouses will have a significant effect
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   on whether we share and what we share and how we
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   share the difficult situations that we're walking
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   through. Here's another biblical guideline to think about, and I—when I
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   was thinking about this, I think I got the most helpful maxim
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   that might guide us. So I'm thinking about Matthew 18 here, where it says, "If your
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   brother sins against you, go privately to see if you can get it
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   worked out, and then if that doesn't work out, take two or three, and if that
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   doesn't work, go to the church." Now what's the overall drift? That's what I ask.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   What's the overall thrust of that approach? And it
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   seems to me that the overall thrust of Matthew 18
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   is to keep relational sins
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   or breakdowns as private as would be
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   helpful for maximum healing to all concerned.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   That's my maxim. So the application would be,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   will a discussion with my spouse really
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   serve to lead toward maximum
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   healing, not only for the immediate conflict, but for any
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   others who might be drawn in? You don't want to multiply
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   the pain or the conflict by having it be known
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   by people that it's unnecessary to be known by if healing
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   can be achieved another way. So it seems to me that
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   that's one of the most significant principles we could express.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   If there's a green light for sharing a concern in every other respect,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   then the question is, am I truly motivated by
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   a desire for wisdom that leads to healing, or
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   am I merely caressing an injury? Am I picking at a
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   scab? Am I licking my own wound
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   and looking for some kind of gratification and thus putting
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   my spouse at risk of joining with me in that
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   sin? And there are, just recently in my life,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   there are two scriptures that have been standing out,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   functioning as a kind of Piper sieve for
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   motives and possible actions through.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Let me just mention them because they've been so powerful for me. One is 1 Peter
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   3.8, "Finally, all of you have," and listen to these words,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   "unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   a tender heart, a humble mind."
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Those are amazing words. Unity,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   sympathy, love, tenderheartedness, humility.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   So in weighing what to talk about another
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   person, put it through this sieve, pass it through this
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   test. Do those words mark what you're about to do?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And the other one is James 3.17, "The wisdom from above is
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   first," and here they come again, "pure, then peaceable,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   gentle, open to reason, full of
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   mercy and good fruits, impartial, sincere."
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Another amazing collection of words that function as
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   amazing tests of whether what I'm about to say is
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   pure. Is it peaceable? Is it gentle? Is it open
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   to reason? Is it merciful? Is it impartial? This is simply
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   astonishing, and so I need
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   to check myself, and those are two verses that have functioned
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   as sieves for me in dealing with people recently that have been
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   so convicting and so helpful. So my answer
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   to the question about Noel and me—I think part of the question was, "What did we do?"—
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   is that there were many situations in my
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   33-year pastoral ministry where I talked to Noel about
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   a church issue or about a personal issue, and
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   there were many when I didn't. And I tried
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   to use these criteria. Will I put her soul at risk?
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Will I burden her in a way that simply would not
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   help her and probably wouldn't help me sufficiently to put her at risk?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And have I filtered my motives
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   so that I'm not acting in a way
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   that is contrary to 1 Peter 3:8 or contrary to James 3:17?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And from this perspective, Tony, I would just
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   say, "Lord, you know how many times I either succeeded or
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   failed at those criteria."
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Yes, great potential and great dangers here indeed. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And we're not done talking about you and Noel just yet, Pastor John, because we have a listener
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   who wants you to describe what you think a simple and expensive wedding would look like.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And I know that you don't only advocate for such a thing, but you actually
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   pulled it off. That's next week, I think on Tuesday. But coming up on
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Monday, a follow-up question to your article on cremation. Now
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   the question is, "Okay, so no to cremation, but can I gift my body
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   to science?" That's a really good question. That's on the table on Monday.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   But we're going to break for the weekend now. Feel free to look back on the episodes from the week. Search our
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   archive of hundreds of episodes, download the podcast app, or subscribe to the podcast
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   or even send us a question of your own. Go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   I'm your host, Tony Granke, and we will see you on Monday.
