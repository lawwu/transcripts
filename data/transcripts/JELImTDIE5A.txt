[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:05.380]   of the bogleheads on investing podcast with head slot cpa ed thank you for joining us for the bogleheads
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.840]   on investing podcast it's great to be here with you today as you know we're going to talk about some of
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.340]   the changes under the one big beautiful bill act we got some great questions from the bogleheads
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.740]   community beforehand but before we dive into the questions maybe let's talk about some of the highlights
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.320]   of the one big beautiful bill act some things that you may see are opportunities or challenges
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.000]   in light of those recent changes there are big items that really some of them will apply to everybody
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.040]   and the interesting part because of the budget gimmickry some things start in 25 some provisions
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.680]   start in 26 some provisions end in 28 some provisions end in 29 some provisions are permanent not only are
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:04:03.500]   so what we really have is a tax code that has devolved into a game of whack-a-mole you get one benefit but
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.200]   then you may lose something else or you get that one and you lose this one a perfect example when we get
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.840]   into it the six thousand dollar senior deduction that sounds good on its face but it faces out at relatively
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:24.460]   low income rate many people may want to raise their income to take advantage of still lower brackets for
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.620]   a Roth conversion and they may have to concede on the six thousand which is not really six thousand it's a
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.620]   six thousand deduction but the largest bracket you'd be in because of the income levels that you would get
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:45.560]   is about 22 percent comes out to about thirteen hundred and tax savings over the long haul you may do much
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.700]   better with a Roth conversion even if you have to concede this deduction
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:59.360]   john luskin jumping in for a quick post interview note to provide some helpful context ed mentioned the new
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:07.980]   six thousand dollar senior deduction twelve thousand dollars for joint filers available through 2025 through 2028
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:21.980]   it phases out starting at seventy five thousand dollars of income for singles and a hundred and fifty thousand for joint filers and has gone entirely at a hundred and seventy five thousand and two hundred and fifty thousand of income respectively
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:30.060]   roth conversions increase taxable income which could push you into the phase out range and even wipe out the new deduction entirely
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.260]   ed's view on this for many it's still worth skipping the deduction to get more money into roth accounts
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.360]   and now back to the show
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:50.480]   it's a lot of delayed gratification that's the key to all tax planning by the way you want to give up something now to get something bigger and better later
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:58.320]   yeah i know you're a big fan of roth conversions and for folks in the audience who aren't familiar with your work now they know
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.320]   and certainly a big part of that is based on that assumption that tax rates might go up
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:10.400]   there's other assumptions you don't need me to tell you ed that goes into calculating the quote-unquote value of roth conversions
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.320]   what your investment returns are going to be what inflation is going to be your life expectancy
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:22.240]   how do you think about those other considerations when doing roth conversion planning
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:31.280]   well as you said i am totally biased i love roth conversions because i love anything tax-free to me that's money in the bank
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:38.000]   you never have to worry about the uncertainty of what future higher taxes could do to your standard of living and
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.720]   spending ability in retirement so you can't assume you'll always be in a lower bracket in
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:52.400]   retirement you may have less income but taxes may be higher so you really have to plan that's why i love
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:00.000]   the roth conversion you lock in today's rates now but that means paying taxes now but here's the secret to all
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.280]   good tax planning i shouldn't even give you the secret but since it's a great show i'm going to give you the
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.360]   secret the secret to all good tax planning always and it's one of my it's in every one of my books
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:22.640]   always pay taxes at the lowest rates that's it it's that simple if you always pay not at the rates at your rates
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.960]   because rates could be high but your rates personally because the deductions could be low
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.560]   or rates could be low but your rate is higher because you had to increase business or personal income
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:40.800]   so always pay at your lowest rates even if that means and here's the part that gets people why they blow my always roll
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:48.640]   even if it means paying a tax before it's required and that's where the roth conversion comes in people
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:55.920]   don't like to pay a tax before they have to many people have this minimum mentality i call it they
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:04.320]   focus on rmds required minimum distributions which means i am not touching my ira till you know they take
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:11.200]   me out screaming and kicking and force me to take it out at age 73 but then look at all the years
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:19.360]   of low rates that you blew you never want to waste a low tax bracket the sweet spot really is people in
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:28.240]   their 60s the key to the roth conversion is when you convert you control your tax rates by converting
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.240]   certain amounts looking at the brackets you can convert and control the taxes you want to pay
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:41.040]   and given today's low rates i would make sure that nobody wastes 24 bracket or lower
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:47.760]   these are historically low brackets now that means converting some money now using up those brackets
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.120]   because if you waste those brackets if you don't fill up a low tax bracket you don't get credit in
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.960]   the future years in fact over the years my cpa colleagues used to tell me they said they would be
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.240]   so happy they'd say ed you're not going to believe it but i kept one of my clients in a zero percent tax
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:11.520]   and you know what my answer would be oh i'm sorry to hear that that means you wasted the ten percent
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.960]   the twelve percent the income you could have got out or i'll give you another example this happened
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:24.560]   during covid a lot of small businesses suffered huge losses a lot of small business owners had these
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:31.520]   passed through entities like s corps and llcs and partnerships and they had huge losses which were
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:39.040]   deductible on their taxes in some cases they even had negative income yet nobody thought of converting
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:45.360]   in those years when they could have converted a lot of their ira and almost no tax so you have to
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:54.400]   look at getting money out while tax rates are the lowest you'll always end up with more so the benefits of the roth you're in control of your tax
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.480]   rates and you get to use the lower brackets and hopefully by the time you get to rmd age you won't
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:07.200]   have much in iras where you're forced to take money so you're getting the point i love roth ira's
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.960]   absolutely one reason i ask about those other variables when it comes to tax planning bill
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.640]   richtenstein he's a co-creator of income solver income strategy and this is and i'm sure you're familiar
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.680]   with it for those folks who aren't it's some tax planning software looks at roth conversions and one
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.920]   thing that's interesting about it is that it lets you move the levers on terms of life expectancy
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.440]   investment returns future tax rates and even if you leave that future tax rate lever alone
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:40.800]   just increasing life expectancy or increasing investment returns makes a case for roth conversion
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.760]   so even if tax rates stay the same roth conversion still might make sense in some situations
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:52.320]   absolutely true see the roth conversion decision comes down to a very simple concept it's one big
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:59.760]   giant bet on where you believe your future tax rates will be when you're forced to take that money
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:06.960]   out if you don't convert and for most people again like me that believe in math i gotta look at the numbers
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:15.520]   and say you know i gotta believe tax rates will be higher all right let's jump to some questions from
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:21.280]   the bogleheads community for you ed about the new tax law change we got a couple related questions
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:27.680]   from the bogleheads forum username five cane eagle 33 both wanted to know about some misconceptions
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:33.760]   misunderstandings that you've maybe seen about the new tax law change what folks are getting wrong oh yeah
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:40.160]   so the big misconception or things that were actually wrong and even in the professional tax services
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:46.320]   on the new deductions the whole business or whether they are above the line or below the line let me
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:54.000]   explain what that means above the line means it will reduce agi your adjusted gross income that is
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.240]   the key number on your tax return that will tell you if you qualify for certain benefits credits deductions
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:06.160]   like a lot of these deductions have income limitations that's the key number but these
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:12.960]   deductions do not reduce that number it's after that number so they're below the line they reduce
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:20.560]   taxable income but not adjusted gross income so i'll give you one which actually the misconception
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:26.640]   was right on the social security website there's the six thousand extra deduction for seniors it was
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:32.960]   book that nobody pays tax on social security has nothing to do with social security nothing to do
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:39.680]   just an extra standard deduction for people 65 or over that meet certain income limitations like i
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:47.200]   talked to you about before basically it's 75 000 for individuals 150 000 for joint married couples after
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:55.920]   that it phases out so it's a six thousand dollar deduction that can reduce all taxable income even
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:03.760]   if you have no social security income and it's only for 65 or over so somebody collecting social security
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:12.880]   say early at 63 they don't get this deduction or somebody who waits who's 66 and would qualify but they didn't
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:18.320]   take social security i think smartly waiting till age 70 where they can get the maximum check
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:24.800]   they still get the deduction even though they're not taking social security so it does not reduce the
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:32.000]   amount of your social security benefits that are taxable here's a good way to think of agi on a tax return
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:39.520]   i'll use a football analogy football has two hands the first half and the second half so does a tax return
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:46.160]   tax return has the first half and halftime is agi adjusted gross income let's say
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:54.880]   you're losing the game you're way down at halftime right but you have an amazing comeback you got five
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:02.800]   touchdowns in the second half does the score at halftime change no the score at halftime is what
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:10.240]   it was at halftime you just did better in the second half or worst that's what a tax return is agi is
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:16.480]   halftime no matter what happens after that the second part of the tax return it doesn't reduce agi those are
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:23.360]   called below the line deductions that's what most of these deductions are they do not reduce agi they're
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:30.480]   below the line so i'm talking about the 6 000 one i'm talking about the misnamed in the law no tax on
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:39.040]   tips no tax on overtime that money is still included in income but you get a deduction that can reduce
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:46.160]   all income so the deductions that's the biggest misinformation out there that i've seen i think a
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:52.080]   lot of that's been corrected by now but the big deductions people are looking at do not reduce adjusted
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:57.920]   gross income whatever that is that's the number you're going to still have to use to determine if
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:03.760]   you're eligible for some of these big benefits yeah i've seen that as well i think another thing that
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.720]   i've seen a lot is misunderstanding that the no tax on tips and no tax on overtime and it's only for a
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.880]   limited amount right right is is the issue yeah so here if you this is the actual law you see what i
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:21.280]   highlighted here the name of that section can you read it there you can do tax tips oh wow it's called
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.960]   that that's not what it does the same thing with overtime if you look at the section of the law this
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:35.200]   is the actual law the name of that provision what does it say there no tax on overtime all right that's the
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:41.280]   title it doesn't do that let's take the tips for example and this income limitation it's a great
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.480]   provision you just have to understand what it does if you're in the tip business you know a waiter or
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:52.400]   waitress something like that could be great for you you can get a big deduction but here's the catch
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:59.360]   to get the tip deduction you would have to report that it has to go on w-2 your tip income and most
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.760]   tip income actually is on a w-2 unless you're working off the books when i'm talking to people
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.840]   if they're thinking oh they're working off the books and they get a deduction no the tips have
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:14.560]   to be on the books and for most you know upstanding places the tips are on the w-2 and you have to pay
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:21.360]   payroll taxes like and medicare taxes on those tips but you do get a nice corresponding deduction but
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:28.240]   it doesn't mean there's no tax on those tips you get a deduction related to the tips which is nice
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:34.400]   but it can reduce all income same thing for overtime and ed mentioned a social security
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.440]   claiming strategy delayed till 70 generally the high earner does definitely want to do that for
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.760]   those folks who want to dive into that topic a little bit more i'll link to some interviews we
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:50.480]   did with mike piper a social security expert so folks can check those out that'll be in the show notes
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:55.280]   right that's a no-brainer i think for most people waiting till age 70 to get a larger check for
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:00.960]   the rest of your life yep yeah at least that higher earn right two-person households lower
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.840]   earner what they do they have some options higher earner always wants to delay until 70 lower earner
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.800]   are going to inherit that higher earners benefit if that higher earner passes first that's why that
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:17.280]   higher earner wants to wait until 70. but let's go back to abba the big winners are a lot of people in
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:24.720]   businesses so they have that qbi qualified business income deduction was retained that's a big 20 deduction
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:30.480]   for a lot of businesses so you know the big items are there increased depreciation if you're a small
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:36.480]   business owner would pass through income you do great on this with respect to qbi i'm curious to hear what
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:42.160]   what your thoughts are on making a and gosh i think i know this answer given you know your pro roth
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.920]   approach but given that in some circumstances if you make a traditional contribution you're going to
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:53.120]   lose that qbi deduction those self-employed folks like myself if they make a roth contribution to an
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:59.040]   individual workplace retirement plan like an individual 401k they get to keep that qbi so
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.040]   that is argued for at least personally or for some other self-employed folks i really like making a
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.720]   roth contribution for that reason because you get to keep that qbi deduction i'm curious to hear what
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:16.720]   your thoughts are on that you are brilliant most people even the accountants don't pick up on this
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:24.400]   this is one of the few provisions where a roth conversion can actually increase the deduction it's
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.320]   counterintuitive because if it's based on income limits for those people if you're a writer a
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:36.320]   performer a accountant attorney you know not a manufacturer they don't have the income limits but
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.840]   it's mostly professionals like i said accounts attorney all of that they're subject to these income limits
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:48.080]   anyway the roth conversion why what you said is brilliant the roth conversion is one of the strange
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:54.720]   items that can either increase the qbi and that stands for qualified business income deduction it's
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:02.800]   a 20 deduction off your based on the taxable income of your business and here's the key or your taxable
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:10.000]   income on your return whichever is lower so you can have a high taxable income on your business but if you
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.480]   have a lot of other deductions and your taxable income on other stuff is low the qbi goes to your lower
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:23.600]   amount so a roth conversion can increase your other taxable income and increase the deduction but watch
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:30.080]   it if you do too much of a roth conversion you go over the limit and you lose the 20 so this is why i
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:36.720]   say what you picked up on is brilliant because the roth conversion has to be really projected so make sure
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:43.920]   it's a balancing act you want to convert enough to maximize the 20 qbi deduction but not so much that you
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:52.000]   lose it and remember roth conversions cannot be undone anymore they cannot be re-characterized you
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.440]   have to know your business income or have a good projection of it by year end let's say you think
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:03.360]   your business income is going to be i don't know three hundred thousand so you may be in line for a twenty
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:09.840]   percent sixty thousand dollar deduction and let's say your income is getting close and you're subject to the
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.880]   limit getting close leave yourself some breathing room don't over convert to a raw thinking i'm going
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:20.480]   to go right up to what that number is because all kinds of wacky stuff happens at the end of the year
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:26.800]   like you get capital gain distributions from mutual funds you have other sources of income you didn't count
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:33.120]   on you know anything can happen at year end especially that first week in december and as a tax preparer
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:38.800]   i used to have a cpa tax practice i stopped that a few years back but people used to come in and say
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:45.600]   what are all these capital gains you know well in the funds you have throw off capital gain distributions
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.160]   at the end of november early december the funds report them so when it's a year like this those numbers
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:57.920]   could be pretty big gosh yeah quick tangent there that's why sometimes when folks come to me and they
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:03.040]   have all these actively managed mutual funds in a taxable account and they have gains on them and
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.680]   they don't want to sell the funds because of the gains the downside is well those funds are going to
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:13.600]   keep spitting out capital gains for as long as you hold them so it really is worth considering to sell
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.840]   those things sooner get rid of that annual distribution you're going to get from those funds
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:23.200]   you mentioned roth conversions with respect to the qbi issue is there anything distinct between making a
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:28.880]   roth conversion or if i'm just going to flat out make a contribution to my individual 401k because
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:35.040]   naturally i can do yeah yeah i'm not a big fan of that but it gives you a deduction but here's why i'm
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:41.280]   not a big fan of 401ks anymore first of all this has nothing to do with the other bill but people say
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:48.000]   well isn't a 401k good no and they say well you get a deduction like you just said people call it a
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.920]   deduction it's not a real deduction it's a fake deduction why do i say that because you have to
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:02.400]   give it back what i call a real deduction is your mortgage interest you deduct it you keep it charity
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:09.280]   you deduct it you keep it now state local taxes you deduct it you keep it when you make a 401k contribution
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:15.200]   and get this so-called deduction all you're really doing is taking a loan from the government that will
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:22.960]   have to be paid back at the worst possible time in retirement when the last thing you want is a big tax
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:30.560]   bill at who knows what rates then so i don't like taking those deductions anymore i think most people
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:39.200]   should now contribute smartly to a roth yes give up the deduction again always pay taxes at the lowest rates
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:44.400]   if you go back to my theme there remember you shouldn't remember because i told you to keep it secret
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:51.520]   always pay taxes at the lowest rates in tax planning you want to take deductions when rates are high not
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:58.880]   when rates are historically low like they are now you want to take income when rates are low so you're
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:05.680]   better off with the roth 401k that people say but ed the match you know i get the company match that law
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:13.520]   changed now you can have the match and catch-up contributions in your roth 401k young people
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:22.800]   especially should only be doing roth iras and roth 401ks at work that's my two cents thanks for
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:28.160]   answering my questions selfishly i appreciate it whatever questions you have i will answer in person
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:34.400]   where john at the bowhuts conference this year that's in let me check my schedule i speak on the 18th
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:41.280]   october 18th i'll be there and i'll give you the skinny on all of this in person and i'll stick
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.600]   around for all your questions we're going to have a great time you're going to hear things from me like
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:52.000]   on john's program here that you never heard anywhere else and it will make you money i'm telling you
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.520]   everybody says they can make money in stocks stocks go up and down there's a lot of uncertainty
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:03.840]   you can make bigger money in good tax planning the other thing you can lose more money if you don't do
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:10.320]   good tax planning because with stocks if the stock market goes down all right it'll recover you'll get
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:17.840]   your money back if you lose money to taxes you're never getting that money back that is a loss
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:23.200]   and the full days for the bogus conference this year are the 17th through the 19th so we're going to
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:28.720]   have you right in that middle day ed and that's going to be in san antonio this year folks go to
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:35.600]   bogus center dot net slash 2025 conference to register and gosh one thing that i do love about
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:41.440]   the conference is that you do get to ask your questions to the speakers on a one-on-one it's
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.520]   phenomenal i think a few years back i cornered clark howard for a little while and got to
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:52.000]   pick his brain since i'm a huge clark howard fan yeah oh that guy's great all right let's jump to
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.840]   some community questions we have two related questions about roth conversion case studies
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:05.200]   first one is from jock doc from the bogus forums he writes my income in retirement is over 75k as a
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:11.280]   single filer what does ed think about the value of roth conversions in this lower income period
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:17.040]   also known as gap years in retirement first doing no roth conversions to maintain a low income
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.680]   to get the highest extra senior deduction so we touched on this a little bit but if there's
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.280]   anything else you'd like to add please go ahead personally i would concede the senior deduction
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:34.480]   it's only a six thousand dollar deduction which relates down at about 22 to about 1300 actual tax
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:41.120]   savings if you give up that and convert more to roth using the 22 and 24 brackets
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:47.920]   i believe you'll be in much better shape down the line when rmds start and you don't have any so you
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:56.240]   keep your future income low and your money starts building tax free we are in an era of the lowest tax
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:03.760]   rates in history and it's going to continue at least for another few years and you don't want to lose out on
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:10.160]   any one of these years to take advantage of the low brackets so in that case if he was sitting in front
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:17.760]   of me i'd say concede concede on the six thousand yes interesting clark howard talked about how excited
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:23.520]   he was to sell a rental property that he had that was no longer fit for his goals and that's because tax
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.200]   rates for him with his long lifespan he had seen much higher rates he was excited to sell that rental at
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:37.040]   the 15 long-term capital gain rates he knew that was effectively a tax sale if you will this question
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.520]   comes from cody garrett a similar question about roth conversions this one about roth conversions while
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:48.880]   working cody asked a married couple age 65 has gross income of a hundred thousand dollars this year they
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:58.320]   have an effective 5.9 federal rate so was making roth contributions while working the answer when we talk
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:04.480]   about tax rates we're talking about not the general tax rates everybody knows what those are it's your tax
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:11.120]   rates based on your own situation your own deductions and income so all tax rates may be low maybe your
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:17.920]   rate is high or vice versa but then we have something called marginal rates these are the taxes you pay on
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:25.280]   the last dollar of income for example if you add a roth conversion at your 24 you'll be taxed at 24
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:32.880]   but not on all of it because we have something called a progressive tax system graduated rates which means
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:39.520]   yeah maybe on a few dollars you'll pay at 24 but most of them will be at the lower rates the 10 12 22
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:45.440]   percent so it's kind of like a bunch of buckets of water once you fill up the 10 percent then the next
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:52.640]   goes to 12 and 22 and 24 it's only the last dollars that's the marginal rate what he's talking about
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:59.840]   is the average rate or what we call the effective rate on all his taxable income so you take all your tax
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:06.480]   liability or what you project it will be and divide it by your taxable income that's why he's coming
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:12.480]   up with 5.9 percent he may have a lot of deductions so he's a great candidate for roth
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:19.600]   again always pay taxes while the rates are low and the reason i say roth means paying taxes you're paying
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:26.320]   if you want to convert but you're also paying for a roth contribution in the loss of a deduction but again
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:32.320]   the ira deduction is not a real deduction because you have to give it back and then some you've got
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:38.080]   to look at the long-term big picture and even people that say i'm going to be in a lower bracket in
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.640]   retirement and that's what a lot of people think they say well i had a big w-2 maybe three four
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.920]   hundred thousand of income and i won't have that in retirement well it doesn't usually work that way
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:53.520]   because first of all you don't have the deductions in retirement you're generally your house is paid off you
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:59.520]   you don't get tax benefits for dependent kids so you have lower deductions and
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:07.680]   you may have larger income because your rmds if you do nothing and it continues to grow and build and
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:16.560]   compound and snowball your rmds can be larger than your highest w-2 ever was and i've seen that with people
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:22.320]   and they say how can this be i'm retired how can my tax bracket be higher so even if rates are the
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:28.960]   same you may not be in a lower tax bracket and we don't even know about future rates and cody garrett
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:35.760]   he's a planner himself he's been on our show before so i'll link to some of those episodes in the podcast
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:43.760]   notes for those who want to check that out let's jump to a question about trump accounts again we had a
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:50.240]   couple users from the bull guts forums asking about this users djm 2001 and user slow and steady
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:57.760]   and then we also had katherine payton ask about this on linkedin questions being would ed recommend trump
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:04.960]   trump accounts once they become available or should we wait until the final details are sorted out can
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:10.880]   they be converted to traditional iris after age 18 etc what's his take and what's his take on the
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:17.520]   restriction to hold only equities within the accounts doesn't that result in worse tax treatment in the long
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:25.280]   run mainly long-term capital gains tax at ordinary rates well number one they're not available till july 4th
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:32.560]   next year one year after the date of enactment so nobody can do it but some people qualify already
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:42.480]   babies born between january 1st 25 so already 25 through 28 babies born in those years get an automatic
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:49.120]   exceed a starting kickoff of a thousand dollars so for that alone nobody's going to say i don't want
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:55.920]   a trump account because it's free money but there's a catch one of them is the investment restrictions you
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.680]   mentioned the biggest downside i see there's nothing wrong with a free thousand dollars except you can't
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:08.880]   get to it till you're 18. it's not like oh i'll take it but i'll pay a penalty no it's a lock box you can't
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:15.040]   touch it so i have a feeling some people may be parents that put a thousand in for a newborn and
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:19.840]   then all of a sudden the pipe breaks and they need a thousand dollars can't get it till the child is that
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:26.080]   you have to wait 18 years to get to any of that money it's only for people that can put the thousand
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:31.680]   dollars in and forget about it but i wonder how many people will do it for the thousand dollars thinking
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:38.800]   they can touch it you can't touch it for 18 years so that's one downside and the investments u.s
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:44.720]   companies are very strict and it's meant to be conservative and nationalist but that's okay but there's
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:50.160]   three sources of contributions the government seed i said the child themselves or the parent
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:55.680]   the grandparent can put in five thousand employers can put in twenty five hundred the great thing about
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:02.000]   the trump accounts forget about the thousand if you're really dedicated to not touching that money
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.240]   let's say you have a new child here you get the thousand you can put another five thousand in
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:12.560]   even though the child isn't working because he's lazy he's just born and he's not working yet how is
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:19.520]   that possible but remember with iras to put money in an ira you have to have compensation wages or
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:26.480]   self-employment income this you don't have to have compensation so you can keep putting money in for
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:33.920]   all the early years of a child's life up to 18 5 000 a year so you can really compound wealth if you're
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:40.160]   okay saying we're gonna load this account up i'm not touching it because you can't touch it until the child
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:46.320]   turns 18. i'm curious ed any thoughts on the practical considerations of having an 18 year old inherit
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:52.320]   whatever amount that's going to grow to 18 years from now well that's a problem too it's their money
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.680]   that's why some people put it in a trust or something even the uniform gifts to minors or
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.640]   transfers to minors it's there when they're no longer a minor so i guess you have to educate your
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.320]   kids you do what i did i had accounts for my kids they're in their 30s they still don't know about
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.960]   it that is not the first time i've heard that and i've got it covered too nobody can find out because
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:18.080]   i do their taxes yeah that's certainly something i encourage folks to think about whether it's the
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:25.600]   trump account or the account ugma custodial roth ira also pretty common i would say it's a good bet for
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:31.440]   the i don't know the first 12 to 15 years of the child's life why do they even need to know they have
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:36.800]   an account i work with someone once and that was their plan and then they were getting statements in
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.800]   the mail and then the kid came home and the kid was you know an adult right the adult came home and
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.840]   they saw the statement and you know they said you know hey dad what is this and at that point the dad
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:51.120]   had to turn the account over but he had the same strategy as it sounds like most folks just don't tell
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:56.640]   the kid about it which is right obviously given that anecdote doesn't always necessarily work
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:05.440]   any thoughts on the commenter's question with respect to ordinary income tax treatment on what
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.560]   would otherwise receive long-term capital gain treatment well that's true yeah it's going to be
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:15.360]   ordinary income tax on the earnings which will be a lot normally we say well the earnings are the smaller
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:21.360]   part but compounding over many years yes there will be earnings and you make money so yeah you could
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:28.080]   put it in a stock account and get capital gains that's true and for those folks who want to nerd
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:35.600]   out more on the issue of having the stocks which would otherwise qualify for long-term capital gain
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:42.080]   rates be taxed at the ordinary if held in a tax-deferred account michael kipsis has a phenomenal article
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:49.440]   on the subject and it almost sort of debunks the issue because michael points out yes stock funds
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:54.560]   normally tax efficient because they are taxed at lower rate they're still not perfectly tax efficient
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:02.160]   because they still have that dividend tax drag and on a long enough timeline because of that dividend
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:08.240]   tax drag it might actually make sense to put something like a stock fund in a tax-deferred account because
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:14.320]   you eventually will have more wealth even after taxes by shielding that annual dividend tax drag
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:18.640]   with that tax referral mechanism that you get with that ira again i'll link to the article in the show
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:24.240]   notes for folks who want to nerd out on that subject that reminds me of another point on the other side
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.120]   to the stock account and this goes way out because we're talking about kids so who knows what the
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:36.240]   rules will be when they die age 90 or 100 or maybe 150 whatever life expectancy will be the benefit
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:42.080]   there's a step up in basis on on those you never pay the capital gains tax but you do pay tax on the
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:47.840]   dividends absolutely which you have to remember to add to your basis i'm told by the brokers and so
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:53.840]   forth they figure that in but just in case they don't i keep track of my all my reinvested dividends
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:58.800]   i keep a running total it's easy you go to the 1099s just to make sure if you ever sell a stock
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.640]   position you're not paying tax on money already paid tax on i know this is something that rick
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:07.280]   ferry has advised in the past you want to opt for what's called specific identification with your
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.800]   custodian at least that's what vanguard calls it and then that's going to help you identify what your
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:18.000]   tax lots are how many shares you bought at what cost and when helps you figure out the tax
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   consequences and helps you with tax planning helps you decide you know which lots you want to share
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.720]   to optimize your tax planning for the year hey it's low tax here maybe i want to sell you know some of
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:32.640]   the stuff with a lower basis first selling stuff with a higher basis during a high tax year given cash
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:38.160]   cash needs all right let's jump to charitable contributions slow and steady from bogus forums
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:44.400]   asks about this who wants to know what your take is on this new provision the charitable provisions the
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:49.760]   benefits the big one the charitable deduction for non-itemizers that doesn't start till next year
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:56.880]   everybody gets 2000 married or 1000 and that's also below the line deduction but everybody gets it that
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.560]   it's not related to income
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:08.240]   one more quick clarification ed also mentioned here from the recent tax law change starting in next year
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:15.120]   in 2026 you'll be able to deduct cash charitable contributions of up to a thousand dollars for single
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:21.040]   filers or two thousand dollars for married filers even if you don't itemize that's a shift from the
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:27.280]   prior rules in the past if your itemized deductions including charitable contributions didn't exceed the
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:33.920]   standard deduction you likely receive little to no tax benefit for your giving but under this new rule
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:41.440]   non-itemizers folks who take the standard deduction which is most people can now get a small deduction
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:47.440]   for charitable giving even if they continue taking the standard deduction back to the show
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:57.600]   but this brings up another issue to do the charity wait for next year what do you do this year maybe
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:07.520]   and you have to tie in the new salt deduction estate and local taxes because more people in high tax states
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:14.720]   because of this law will now be qualifying to itemize their deductions so more people can take more
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:21.360]   charitable contributions if you're in a high tax state like where i am in new york new jersey california
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:29.360]   so if you're in a high tax state you're probably going to start itemizing your real estate taxes and
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:35.440]   state taxes you can go up to forty thousand dollars you can put in mortgage interest charitable deductions and
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:41.520]   other deductions that you may have so you can really do well with itemizing and i may take the deductions
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:48.080]   they're talking about take more of that now again while you're able to itemize now if you're in a
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:54.480]   state that doesn't have any state tax like florida texas and some of those that's not an issue for you but
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:00.240]   also next year even if you do itemize and this may be a reason for some people to do their charitable
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:05.600]   planning now while they can itemize and also if your charitable deduction is large enough that might
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:11.360]   get you into the itemizers club anyway what i mean where the itemized deduction is higher than that you
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:16.720]   would have got from the standard deduction so if that gets you into the club you're better off doing it
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:23.680]   this year because next year your deductions are limited if you're a high earner number one charitable
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:30.800]   deductions have this point five percent floor half of one percent people say oh that's nothing let me
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:36.720]   give you an example if you think that's nothing let's say you make four hundred thousand a nice w-2
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:42.800]   so the first two thousand dollars of charitable deductions you don't get so let's say that person
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.760]   makes a two thousand dollar charitable gift and goes to itemize they don't get that deduction
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:54.480]   so it doesn't sound like a big number point five percent but if you have a high income and you're making
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:00.640]   relatively low and i'm not saying two thousand is a low deduction but you'll lose it and then if you're in
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:06.080]   the top bracket in the 37 percent bracket and again these things i'm talking about happen next year so
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:12.800]   you may want to front load your charity and bunch them into this year next year if you're in a 37 percent
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   bracket you only get a tax deduction for all your itemized deductions including charity worth 35 percent
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:27.040]   you don't get to deduct 37 cents on the dollar so for the charity i would look at what you can put in
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:33.440]   this year well there's no restrictions and you may be able to itemize because of the soft deduction or
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:40.000]   if not if you're in a low tax state because you're giving a lot and we just had phil demuth on a
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.680]   previous episode of bogle heads on investing talking about some charitable gifting strategies i'll link to
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:50.800]   that in the show notes for folks who want to check that out i will tell you another thing that he picked
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:56.880]   up on it was in the wall street journal last week i believe for those who i said qualify now for
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:04.960]   the forty thousand dollar soft deduction state and local taxes the extra 40 it go went from 10 to 40
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:12.240]   that 30 additional that's what you got in the abba law it cuts off when income goes over 500 000 it
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:19.280]   starts phasing out what he pointed out in that article is that once you're in that 500 000 at 600 000 you
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:26.720]   lose it completely so it's not most people but if you're in the 500 000 to 600 000 the tax
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:34.800]   because of the phase out in that last 100 000 of income is actually 45.5 percent
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:41.040]   because of the loss of that 30 000 salt you don't lose the whole salt deduction it goes back to the
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:49.680]   10 000 but that loss it's like a domino effect the loss of that 30 000 not only puts you in a higher rate
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:56.800]   but you lose the 30 000 which in turn puts you into a 35 percent bracket so you lose there too and
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:06.720]   that's how you get a 45.5 tax rate on that hundred thousand okay let's talk about the value of comparing
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.760]   roth conversions or having traditional dollars in retirement this question comes from username
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:18.480]   jbtx from the bullguts forums who writes is there value in holding a certain amount of money in
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:24.560]   traditional dollars to fill up lower tax brackets down the road or if one has high medical expenses in
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:32.000]   the future in which point it'll be good to have taxable income to offset that deduction should i keep some
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:39.120]   traditional iras that's a great question and the answer is yes for several reasons you have high
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:45.120]   standard deductions even if you're not itemizing or you may have itemized you want some of that income
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:52.480]   to come out tax-free also you may have medical expenses you want to use taxable money to get an offset
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:59.520]   a big reason is if you're charitably inclined and you can take advantage of qcd's qualified charitable
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:07.120]   distributions only available to traditional ira owners over 70 and a half iras are the worst assets
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:13.600]   because of the tax law well they're also the best assets if you give them away because they're so lousy
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:20.560]   tax-wise give them to somebody else but the charity doesn't pay taxes so iras are the best assets to give
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:28.400]   to charity and you can do that now by making a direct transfer from your ira to a qualified charity
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:36.560]   the amount is up to 108 000 with inflation increases so that's a great way to give to charity i never say
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:42.720]   just to be clear to give to charity for the tax benefits you give because you want to give that's
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:49.520]   really the reason because anybody i ever saw that did it for tax reasons was always unhappy when they
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:56.320]   realized they actually had to give the property away what do you mean i thought i just get a tax benefit
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:01.360]   so you have to want to give that's why i use the term charitably inclined but if you're giving anyway
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:09.280]   if you qualify for qcds give through your ira you're giving anyway but now you get a benefit and that benefit
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:16.880]   is one of those above the line deductions that reduces agi it can also offset the income from your rmd your
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:24.000]   required minimum distribution that's the way to give but you'd need the traditional ira balance to do it
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.120]   so if you're saying well i converted everything to a roth i don't want to really have rmd income and
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:36.960]   during my life my plan is to give a hundred thousand to charity so keep a hundred thousand or so in your ira
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:43.360]   little by little as as rmds come out give it to charity and nobody pays the tax all right let's
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:49.920]   talk about some tax changes with regards to roth accounts this one is from you the name lie rad from
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:55.760]   the little guys forums who asked what's a good way to think about possible future tax law changes and how
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:02.400]   it should affect how much should be converted to roth i think one thing that the user is trying to get out
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:08.880]   here is that we don't know what the future holds so how do you plan how do you do tax planning
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:15.920]   oh it's easy you plan with things you know you know what today's tax rates are that's why i said you
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:21.760]   can lock in lower rates and you can control the taxes you pay you can control how much you're going
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:29.360]   to use the 22 of the 24 bracket hit it while you can control it we have another question from the
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:37.440]   booklets community this one pits your favorite roth accounts against the hsa the health savings account
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:43.200]   and the user asked if i have a thousand dollars to invest which one should i put my money in a roth ira
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:51.440]   or an hsa i still like the roth because the roth has no restrictions the actual original contributions
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:59.200]   most people don't realize this can be withdrawn any time for any reason tax and penalty free not the
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:05.280]   earnings the actual contributions so they could be used for education or anything you could use it to
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:11.680]   bet on a horse i mean you can use it for anything hsa's on the other hand is an amazing account because of
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:17.920]   the triple tax benefit you get a deduction on the way in you get a deferral on the income it
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:25.040]   generates and if you use it for qualified expenses it's tax free and people are using it as another
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:31.040]   type of retirement account but what i'm seeing happening people have too much in these accounts
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:36.560]   that they'll never spend and then you get hit with a big tax at the end or at death people are really
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.600]   hitting these things hard so you have to balance i would definitely take advantage of the hsa
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:47.360]   if you don't already have one because there will be medical expenses no question about that
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:53.920]   but you're limited to using it just for those so i would say you know all right a hundred two hundred
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:47:00.160]   thousand after that i know expenses can get high but you should start really diversifying and have
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:05.600]   more in the roth that can be used for anything and another benefit of making hsa contributions at least
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:11.280]   through an employer is you got to avoid payroll tax so there's an additional tax savings there right
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:18.160]   yeah that is a big ben there are big benefits and for folks who aren't super tax nerds a popular
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:23.840]   strategy is to contribute to a health savings account and then don't spend the money immediately for
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:29.360]   qualifying medical expenses rather you're going to invest the money in that account and then spend
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:35.520]   that later in life once that money's had a chance to grow tax-free all right let's jump to another
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:42.560]   question from the bulkheads community this question comes from username sc9182 from the forums who asks
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:48.640]   once you finish converting all your tax-deferred traditional dollars to roth dollars what is your
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:55.200]   next tax move well two things we just talked about maybe it's not a good idea to convert everything to
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:01.040]   hold back some traditional iras for tax risk diversification using up low brackets and standard
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:08.800]   deductions each year or for qcds those charitable or for medical bills that may pop up so let's say you did
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:14.560]   everything in the roth you did all of that i love i'm going to say the cash value life insurance because
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:20.880]   to me it's like a super roth the income tax exclusion the tax-free feature of life insurance
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:28.240]   is the single biggest benefit in the tax code and i would load up there especially a cash value policy
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:33.200]   that you could draw from if you need it during life most people say they don't want to do it or if they
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:38.400]   don't want to do it they say well i know about the death benefit most people don't realize they has
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:45.600]   lifetime benefits i have this myself i have a cash value policy because i'm all wrought out also i have
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:52.880]   a cash value policy but it has a long-term care rider i love that feature if i ever needed money for
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:58.160]   long-term care it could take it right out of the policy so what the kids get less who cares about
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:03.360]   them anyway they're going to get plenty so last thing i want to worry about is if i need that high
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:08.800]   medical bills the nursing home and all of that that kind of extended medical care the last thing i want
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:14.080]   to do is rely on my kids to come up with the thousands of dollars needed for my care every month
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:19.200]   i want to know it's taken care of and i think everybody else should know that too so i took care
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:24.800]   of it for myself and again i do not sell life insurance i have never sold any financial products
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:30.560]   i don't sell stocks bonds funds insurance annuity none of that i'm not an insurance professional i'm a
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:35.520]   tax advisor always check this with your own insurance professionals let's jump to another
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:43.280]   question from the bullheads community this question is about designating a trust as a beneficiary of an
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:50.000]   ira this user wants to know what the downsides are of that approach and what individual should consider
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:57.680]   if they are bequeathing to either eligible designated beneficiaries and or spendthrifts here's how i answer
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:03.920]   because i get this question all the time when should i name a trust as my ira beneficiary or when should i
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:09.680]   name a trust for anything and my answer is always the same when should you name a trust when you don't
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:15.040]   trust because if you trusted them you wouldn't need a trust so i should have called it a don't trust that's
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:20.800]   when you name a trust when you don't trust and there are reasons you could have minor beneficiaries
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:26.080]   that can't handle money you can have even older adult children that also can't handle money they may be
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:32.000]   addicts they have gambling and drug addiction horrible things divorce bankruptcy if you're in the category
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.440]   you say i need a trust for this post-death control and protection you're not doing it for tax reasons
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:42.640]   if anything the taxes could be higher in their trust you're doing it for personal reasons control
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:48.560]   reasons and that's a good reason so for those people that have those issues do everything you can if it's
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:53.760]   that important to you convert that whole ira and it's probably a large one that's why you're worried
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:51:01.760]   about it to a roth ira and leave the roth ira to the trust the roth ira is the better asset to leave to
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:09.040]   the trust because you eliminate the whole trust tax problem and the taxes to the beneficiaries two has
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:14.720]   to come out at the end of 10 years after death or if it's an edb they can stretch it but you eliminate
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:20.640]   the tax this gives you the freedom to use that trust that ties up the money and holds it back from the
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:27.200]   beneficiary without worrying about trust taxes or better yet take the money out and put it in a life
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:32.560]   insurance policy and leave the insurance to an insurance trust there you don't even have to
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:39.120]   worry about rmd rules complicated tax rules you make your own rules you get your own customized plan
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:46.560]   and there's no tax so you want tax-free vehicles going to a trust so to be clear i'm saying yes some
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:54.160]   people need a trust but the ira is a disaster tax-wise leaving a traditional ira to a trust don't do it
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:52:00.400]   if they need a trust use a roth ira which means taking the money and paying the tax now but remember
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:07.760]   it's not if but when this tax will be paid possibly at much higher rates you're paying a tax now that
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:13.760]   will have to be paid anyway may as well get it off the table and then you have the plan you want leaving
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:19.520]   a roth to a trust or the life insurance to the trust and don't do the life insurance to the ira
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:25.040]   distribution going to the life insurance if you're under 59 and a half there would be a 10 penalty
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:30.080]   there is none with a raw you convert to a roth as long as all the dollars are converted you can leave
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:35.440]   the roth to the trust and the reason being to leave those roth dollars to that trust making the conversion
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:40.480]   yourself is because that trust is going to reach those higher brackets more quickly than you will as
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:46.480]   an individual or even married filing jointly oh yeah yeah yeah yeah you can control it now but when it goes into
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:51.280]   the trust there are no brackets all tax-free same thing with life insurance then you can have your
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:56.720]   customized plan you can put anything you want pretty much in those trusts and our last question looks
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:04.240]   like it's a fun one from david who asks about the what you call the greatest benefit in the tax code the
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:10.960]   greatest single benefit in the tax code is the tax exemption for life insurance it's just unbelievable that
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:17.040]   you can accumulate this kind of large amounts of money it's like a super roth and it's all tax-free
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:22.240]   and it can even be estate tax-free because life insurance can be on the outside of your estate in
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:28.640]   an irrevocable trust there's nothing like it and again i don't sell the product i have it myself because
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:33.360]   it's a great product everything that we talked about on this show which is why i get so passionate about
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:38.720]   it i've done for myself and my family all roth all the life insurance all of these things
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:44.640]   and ed we'll see you at the bowheads conference this year i hope to see everybody have great questions
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:51.120]   smart questions too it's a smart audience that's what i'm looking forward to i hope to see you all there
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:59.520]   it's in san antonio home of the alamo october 17th through 19th and i'm speaking on the 18th don't miss that

[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:10.880]   question on that 199a the qbi deduction on how the roth affects uh most cpas don't pick up on that
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:14.880]   that was brilliant a lot of people always talk about you know shove those traditional dollars
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:20.320]   in for self-employed and like i don't want to give up qbi i love qbi s-corps same thing i think about
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:25.360]   escort a lot of people are bullish on s-corps i'm like well you're gonna lose qbi and you're also
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:28.880]   looking at a smaller social security benefit as well can't help but think about that when
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:34.720]   people mention the s-corps strategy yeah it's a big deduction and it got extended and improved
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:40.160]   next year with larger brackets larger phase out ranges all right good yeah we covered a lot of
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:48.400]   great stuff yeah i'll see you there remember the alamo thank you for listening to the 85th
