[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   A podcast listener named Zach writes in to ask this, "You have mentioned many times
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.480]   before the glorious role of a woman being a mother and a homemaker.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.880]   Biblically speaking, though, what role does the husband have in homemaking and in caring
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.080]   for the children?
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.360]   What responsibility does he carry?"
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:36.320]   The husband bears the joyful, weighty responsibility of overseeing and leading the household so
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.120]   that each of the members flourishes to the fullest extent that God has planned.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.680]   That's the simplest way to say it.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:55.600]   A big, overarching statement, he's the overseeing, responsible one, which involves, he gives
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.600]   guidance for forming and formulating the moral vision of the family, what does it stand for,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.560]   what are its ultimate goals, what's the tone of it, what's the spirit of the family, the
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.920]   structures of the family, the expectations of the family.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.200]   His oversight involves primary responsibility for protection in the family, physically and
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.920]   morally and spiritually.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.480]   It involves the primary responsibility for providing for the family.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:29.460]   It involves a servant heart that leads by modeling rather than mere commanding.
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.800]   And it involves cultivating joy as the indomitable atmosphere because of the gospel and the sovereignty
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.800]   of God.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.120]   Let me just tick off a few Bible verses for those observations.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.520]   The husband is the head of the wife, Ephesians 5.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.800]   That means he's leader, he gives guidance.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.880]   That's what the head does to the other parts of the body.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.960]   The eyes are in the head, the ears are in the head, the tongue and the voice is in the
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.360]   head, the brain is in the head.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.880]   Of course, it doesn't mean the other parts of the body don't have their responsibility
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.280]   before God in their own way.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.520]   It just means there's a unique role for the husband to lead.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.920]   He's like the Savior.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.880]   The husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.440]   himself its Savior, which means, I take it, something like a protector, a deliverer.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.640]   He guards the family from moral evil and physical evil.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.160]   Husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her, which means
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.360]   all this leadership and all this protection is sacrificial.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.280]   He's not overbearing.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.640]   It's uplifting.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.200]   He leads like Christ.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.880]   He remembers that Jesus said, you remember like the nations, they all like to be called
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.320]   benefactors and boast as great men.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:57.200]   "It shall not be so among you who is greater, the one who sits at table or the one who serves.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.840]   I am among you as one who serves."
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.400]   So he's telling dads, serve your kids, serve your wife.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.480]   Let servant leadership mark your oversight of the home.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.480]   And then this word of cherishing in Ephesians 5, 28, "In the same way, husbands should love
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.240]   their wives as their own bodies.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.960]   He who loves his wife loves himself, for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.260]   and cherishes it as Christ does the church."
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.400]   So there's a nourishing and a cherishing.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.160]   The husband's a provider.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.780]   He provides nourishment.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.640]   He doesn't sit back and expect his wife to provide for the family.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.760]   He takes primary responsibility and they work it out together, both of them using their
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.420]   gifts to provide for this family.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.180]   And he does it, he does all this, Tony, with joy.
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.120]   He does it with joy.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:04:00.000]   Deuteronomy 6, 6, "Let these words that I command you be on your heart.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.200]   You shall teach them diligently to your children, shall talk of them when you sit in your house,
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.680]   when you walk by the way, when you lie down, when you rise up."
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.720]   That's the peculiar teaching function of dads.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.920]   And the reason I say dads is because in Ephesians 6, it says, "Children, obey your parents in
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.840]   the Lord," and then moves in verse 4 to say, "Fathers, bring them up in the discipline
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.560]   and instruction of the Lord."
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.080]   And all of this instruction has at the center of it, "I spoke these things to you that my
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.520]   joy might be in you and that your joy might be full."
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.640]   So the father carries the burden of shaping the spirit and the instructions and the manpower
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.680]   of the family and shaping the child's character and the child's skills and the worldview of
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.360]   the child, all as a servant of the Lord with joy, because he's a little pastor.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:03.000]   And Hebrews 13, 17 says, "Obey your leaders, submit to them, let them do this with joy,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   for that would be of no advantage to you if they did it with groaning."
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   So dads who lead their kids and their wives with groaning are not serving them.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.080]   We men are little pastors in our home.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.000]   We have a little church there, and we're responsible to lead that little church, create the vision
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.320]   for that little church, create the spirit and the atmosphere for that church, and it's
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.760]   to be one of joy so that the kids realize that to be happy in God is really what life
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.760]   is about.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.240]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to the podcast.
