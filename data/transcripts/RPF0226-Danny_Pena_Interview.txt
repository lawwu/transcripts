[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320]   Today we talk about building a passion business and specifically, how can you make a living
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:26.760]   off of video games?
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.440]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.360]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.680]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.840]   I'm back.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.000]   Had a busy time the last weekend out at Podcast Movement 2015.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.360]   I recorded a total of 16 very good interviews while I was out there and today I bring you
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:52.900]   the first interview with Danny Pena, host of Gamer Tag Radio and one of the first inductees
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.920]   into the podcasting hall of fame.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.920]   I'm glad to be back with you.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.520]   Sorry for a few days of delay.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.280]   It's been a lot of changes going on in my life.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.000]   I will share some of those changes with you in coming shows but today I wanted to make
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.280]   sure that I wasn't gone for too long and one of the primary purposes of my going out to
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.640]   podcast movement, in addition to my own personal and professional development, was to record
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.320]   a number of interviews for you and like I said 16 total.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.360]   All of them are good.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.180]   Some of them are excellent and today we're going to kick it off with one that is very
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.920]   good, Danny Pena.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.520]   And this for me is a really important topic.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.800]   Let's talk about building a passion business and how things like video games can actually
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.480]   be useful.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.720]   Enjoy.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.000]   Danny welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.240]   I appreciate you being with me today.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.960]   Thanks for inviting me man.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.680]   This is a pretty cool setup over here.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.620]   We're here at Podcast Movement and we both live in South Florida so I was going to get
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.240]   with you in South Florida but this worked out great.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.560]   I wanted to have you on today to talk about the business of video games.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.800]   And I'm going to give you a caveat.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.000]   I am not a video gamer.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.480]   I'm one of those people who scoffs at video games.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.880]   And so when I was thinking about somebody who could be a proponent and an advocate of
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.140]   video games, I thought you would be the perfect guy.
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.320]   So we're going to talk about the business of video games and a little bit about your
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.700]   personal journey.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.300]   Start off with just a little bit of your background as it relates to the business of video games.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.280]   For me, I started Internet Radio back in 2001.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.280]   I had a show called PSO Radio.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.440]   It was all about one of my favorite games of all time.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.640]   It's called Fanny Star Online that came on the Sega Dreamcast.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.800]   So what I did was I used to get people within the community and we'll talk about issues
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   with the game.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.280]   We'll review quests because Sega will post a lot of new quests weekly online and stuff
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.240]   and that's how I started.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.680]   So I used to record on a cassette player and I convert that into MP3 and I put it up on
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.680]   MP3.com.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.680]   That's how I started.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.480]   MP3.com, it was more for music artists.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.040]   So they have their music there and whoever downloads or streams their content will get
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.680]   paid from MP3.com.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.680]   So I was like, "Wait a minute.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.060]   I could do that but instead of music, talk radio."
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.820]   So I did that and we got a huge following.
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.360]   So my first check was $500 in 2001.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.640]   So I was like, "Man, I want to start a business out of this."
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.400]   -And what was the check from?
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.480]   -From them.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.280]   Just because of the amount of people that were downloading and streaming our content.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.400]   And I also had CDs of special events that I recorded.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.280]   People could buy it and have it as a collection.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.280]   That's how I started with that.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.800]   So then I got to meet Microsoft, Nintendo throughout the years, networked with them
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.680]   and also Sony.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.440]   And I took a break because I was doing the whole music.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.720]   I used to be a promoter for the music industry in Miami and in New York.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.080]   So I was doing that for two, three years.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.320]   And then in 2005, I wasn't happy with that.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.760]   I was like, "Man, let me do this podcast.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.080]   Not podcast but let me do this radio thing."
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.720]   And February 2005, I launched Gamer Tag Radio which now this is our 10th year.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.480]   So when I started, I wasn't thinking about business, downloads, none of that stuff.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.080]   I wanted people to hear my content.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.080]   That's what I was thinking about.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:37.720]   So then iTunes launched podcast on their software and eventually it just became a hit.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.720]   You know?
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720]   So...
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.160]   - And fast forward today in 2015, your show is...
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.080]   Tell us about your show now and how it's distributed and how big it is.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.680]   - Well, this is a great thing.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.200]   This is our 10th year and this is the biggest year ever for us.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.840]   We signed with Play It Network.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.520]   They're part of CBS Radio.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.760]   We signed with them a week before our anniversary.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.120]   That was like a big, huge milestone for us.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:08.440]   We had nearly a million downloads for the month of June during E3.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.500]   That's where we go where we get to see games and products from companies that show us in
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.960]   advance before it comes out.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.040]   And we do a lot of interviews, roundtable discussion.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.800]   We even had a studio booked for the whole week that CBS hooked us up.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.800]   So we did that.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.800]   That was like a dream come true, man.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.160]   I started off with a cheap microphone, built-in mic from a computer.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.680]   That's how I started recording my show.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.400]   And eventually I got money.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.200]   I started investing on...
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.280]   I was investing more for events.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.240]   I wanted to attend events and meet people.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.280]   And that's how we got our name out there.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.000]   And yeah, eventually now we have pretty good equipment and everything.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.560]   So we're legit now.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   - And so what's awesome about this is, in my mind, it's a great example of how taking
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.280]   an interest and focusing on it and pursuing it, not knowing where that would go, ultimately
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.840]   opened up a lot of doors for you.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.960]   And at this point, you are pretty well known and a leader in many ways in the video game
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.960]   industry.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.960]   - Yes.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.960]   It's crazy because every time I go to an event, people are like, "Man, I listened to your
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.960]   show.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.960]   Let's take some pictures.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.960]   Hey, I need some advice.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.960]   I have a podcast too."
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.800]   It's crazy how time has changed.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.240]   Because back then when I started, there was no social media, none of that stuff.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.720]   And how I got my name out there was I was attending events and going to retail stores.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.440]   Let's say a big, huge game is coming out.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.200]   Let's say Grand Theft Auto, Halo, whatever.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.200]   People are in line.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.000]   So I go there with flyers, with my recorder, give flyers to everybody, tell them about
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   the show.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   "Hey, you want to be part of the show?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Tell us why you're buying this game.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.640]   Why are you so excited?"
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.120]   So that's how I did it.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.000]   Like that, going to a bunch of stores locally in Miami.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.400]   And I started locally and then eventually went to other cities too, like New York, LA,
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.400]   and stuff like that.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.400]   So, yeah.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.080]   - So, my understanding is you've been doing the show and you're earning money off of it,
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.800]   but you've been doing this as a side work the entire time.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.200]   You've been working doing other work during this whole career, right?
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.560]   - Yeah, I work, my 9 to 5 is Discovery Channel Latin America.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.120]   I also, a couple years ago, I had a show with them.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.560]   Same thing about gaming, video-wise for Latin America.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.420]   So I'll talk in English and they'll translate it to Spanish and Portuguese.
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.000]   And they had it exclusively on their website.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.040]   And also, they like TV promos for them, promoting the show.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.440]   - And did that emerge because they knew you had the video game podcast?
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.440]   - Yes, yes.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.800]   It's a long story, but I'm going to keep it short about that.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.600]   I got back from E3 and I was working and they called me, "Hey, Danny, can you go upstairs?
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.760]   I would like to talk to you."
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.760]   I was like, "This is weird."
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.800]   So I go upstairs and I go to the room.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.000]   It's a huge conference room where we usually have meetings and stuff.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.720]   And the VP was there and a bunch of other people.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.920]   I'm like, "Oh my God, am I getting fired?
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.600]   What the hell is going on here?"
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.960]   So then we started talking and they started asking me questions about, "What is a podcast?
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.960]   What do you do?
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.520]   Tell us about video games."
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.360]   And they were asking me random questions.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.480]   I'm like, "This is so weird."
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.480]   So then we finished.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.640]   They were like, "Oh, we're going to talk to you later.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.640]   We're planning some stuff."
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.640]   I'm like, "All right, cool."
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.920]   So I leave and I hear, when I close the door, everybody started clapping like, "Oh man,
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.920]   this is it.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.920]   This is it."
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.920]   I was like, "What was that about?"
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.120]   So then eventually my friend was telling me, "Yeah, they wanted me to do a show for Discovery."
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.680]   So I did that for a year.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.380]   So I was doing that, I was doing the podcast and I was working at the same time.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.360]   So it was a very stressful year.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.640]   It was too many things.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.960]   But I didn't want to let that opportunity go.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.720]   So I did that for a while.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:53.240]   And I also do launch party products for companies too, for video games.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.800]   So let's say a big game is coming out.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.280]   They want our community to try out their game, to give us a budget.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.360]   We rent a venue.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.360]   We have a DJ performances.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.240]   We have TVs everywhere where people could try out the game.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.240]   And at the same time, we're hyping the crowd, giving away stuff, free systems, free games.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.280]   And at the same time, it's free for the public, but we're getting money out of that from video
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.480]   game companies too.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.800]   So I've been doing that for a couple of years.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.080]   - Do you have any thoughts of leaving Discovery and just doing the video game?
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.520]   - I get that question all the time.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.920]   - It's almost like if you built this foundation and worked for 10 years of this dream business,
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.040]   then many people, the first thing you want to know is why not pursue it?
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.040]   - I love my job.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.480]   I'm happy with my job.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.200]   I just feel that it's not the right time.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.200]   And the time when I'm ready for that, I'll do it.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.840]   But I'm happy with my job right now.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.960]   - So I want to talk about the money in video games because what fascinates me is video
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:56.320]   games is the perfect archetype for the angry parent yelling at the child saying, "Why are
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.160]   you wasting your time on these video games?"
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.720]   - Which I heard about this with my parents back then when I was a kid.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.720]   Many times.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.720]   Many times.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.920]   - I mean, my kids are two years old and three months, so they're not playing video games.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.000]   But I would be one of those parents yelling at a child, "You're not playing video games."
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.680]   - I mean, there's a lot of good things about that.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.680]   The majority of people know about games as mainstream, like the typical shooting games
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.680]   and stuff like that.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.840]   But there's a lot of games that is not mainstream.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.140]   There's a lot of critical thinking stuff.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.840]   It's good for the kid.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.040]   I love Minecraft for the kid because they could create their own stuff, share with their
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.400]   friends and it's friendly too.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.800]   Like a parent could play with the kids too.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.800]   That's the type of games that we like to talk about on our show.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.960]   - Okay.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.400]   So there are people who make their full-time living playing video games.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.400]   - Yes.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.960]   - How do they do that?
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.160]   - There's different ways.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.880]   There's pro gamers where they go to tournaments.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:03.240]   And one of my friends, this is like a couple years ago, him and his team, they were so
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:08.680]   good that they had a lot of sponsors that one of their companies that deals with the
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:14.280]   tournament, MLG, that's their name, they did a contract with them for a million dollars
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.280]   for all four of them.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.280]   - Wow.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.280]   - Because they were so good at that game.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.280]   Really, really good.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.120]   So they will travel around the world to compete.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.480]   Think of it as like MMA.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:28.040]   They rock their t-shirts with different names of companies that sponsor them and stuff.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.040]   That's one way.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.640]   Another way is of course the podcast or now what's big is live stream and YouTube.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.080]   That's like the biggest thing right now for that.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:43.480]   And the reason is back then, how we used to get cheat codes and reviews was through magazines
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.800]   or stuff like that, right?
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.560]   There was no internet back then.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.760]   Now it's easy.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.060]   Any kid could just go on YouTube, search for a game to see how it is.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.440]   If they like it, they'll go and buy it.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:12:01.200]   So at the same time, YouTube have ads and let's say PewDiePie, he's a very popular gamer.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.520]   - He's the number one YouTube channel in the world, right?
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.520]   - Yeah.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:11.160]   I mean, I'm not a huge fan, but I love seeing a gamer doing that type of business because
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.760]   I think he made like almost, I think it was like 7 million in a year.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   - That is amazing.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.160]   - So him posting crazy videos, talking about games at the same time, there's companies
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:26.600]   that pay them to post their game like through his YouTube channel.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:34.520]   And he was also featured on this TV show, the South Park, which they same exact thing.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.720]   They were talking about the same thing we was doing like a YouTube, but for South Park.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.320]   So it opened the doors for him.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.640]   So there's a lot of different ways to make money from that.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.640]   But at the same time, I think you should be really, really careful since day one, every
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:54.440]   time we get something for free or we get paid or anything, we let our community know about
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.440]   that.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:01.080]   Because I don't want our community to feel, I don't want them to feel uncomfortable with
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.680]   something that we're promoting because we say, "Oh, it's great."
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   But it's not.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:15.240]   Every time I go to an event that a company fly us to Europe or Canada or any other places,
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.520]   we mention it on our show because we build that trust throughout the years.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.800]   Yeah, we're getting money and certain things, but why not mention that to your listeners?
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.400]   So yeah, that's what we do.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:31.760]   - What fascinates me about it, in PewDiePie, I was researching one time top YouTube channels
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.760]   like, "Wow, this one."
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.440]   I went and subscribed and I just start looking at these videos roll up in my YouTube subscription
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.440]   sheet.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.080]   I'm like, "Why does anybody watch this?"
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.280]   But obviously, for his demographic, the people that enjoy his stuff, he's a star.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.240]   - Yeah, he's an influencer.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.080]   So company loves that.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.800]   That's the reason why Microsoft stayed in touch with me and a lot of other committee
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.800]   members are doing the same through YouTube or live stream because we can influence people.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.680]   We could tell people, "Yes, this game is hot.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.720]   No, this game is not."
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:09.760]   And they trust us and they will eventually decide based on what we say on our show.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.240]   So that's why companies contact us all the time, all the time.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.960]   - So do you, let's say that I'm a 15-year-old gamer and I come to you and I say, "Man, I
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.960]   just love games.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.120]   I want to make a career out of this."
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.760]   What kind of advice would you give me in that situation?
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:31.960]   - What I always tell them is try to attend events like PAX and talk to the independent
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.400]   companies.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:40.280]   That's the easy way to get in to meet people and ask some questions.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.640]   Or go to a university like Full Sail that's pretty big in South Florida.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.640]   Well, it's not South Florida.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.640]   It's in Tampa, I believe.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.760]   Tampa, Orlando, around the area, which is also a place where they teach about video game
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.080]   design and everything.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.960]   These are good things.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:59.800]   Two of my staff members, former staff members, they should be part of our show.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:05.200]   Because of them attending events and connecting with people within the industry, now they
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.560]   got an opportunity to work for a video game company.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.080]   That's why they left our podcast.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.160]   One of them works for Gameloft.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.560]   Gameloft is one of the biggest mobile app game companies out there around the world.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.400]   They're huge for iOS and Android.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:24.840]   And another one, his name is Jonathan, he also got a job for EA Sports in Orlando.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.400]   He was there for a bit.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.320]   Now he works for a different company, a mobile company now in New York City.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:36.840]   The reason why is because networking, attending events, meeting people, and at the same time,
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.640]   learning about the industry too.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.880]   I think that will help out big time.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:50.560]   It seems just like a great example of how, I don't know how, so the video game industry
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.960]   would be a product of the 80s?
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.880]   That would be?
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.520]   You could say 70s, but it wasn't mainstream.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:05.480]   80s was like the mainstream era, you know, like Atari, ColecoVision, Nintendo, all that
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.480]   stuff.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.720]   That's when it became more mainstream.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:16.640]   And then around a couple years ago, during, let me see, 2005, that's when, well actually
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:23.620]   PlayStation, that was a pretty big era too, that helped to push the industry even more
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.820]   to the masses.
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:34.280]   But then 2005 with Xbox 360, PlayStation, the Nintendo Wii, it became even more mainstream.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:42.600]   And I believe a couple years ago, Call of Duty, I can't remember which game it is, they
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.480]   made so much money, more money than any other entertainment out there.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.200]   More than movies, more than music, books, everything.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.680]   Time has changed, man.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.680]   Time has changed.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.360]   I know a lot of people, it looks crazy, like really?
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.000]   A video game?
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.080]   But I'm telling you, it's big, man.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.480]   These companies spend millions and millions of dollars investing in marketing, developing
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.480]   the game.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.320]   There's a big team working on it, 500 to 1,000 people.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.880]   That's a lot of money with this business.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:17.040]   So yeah, I mean, time has changed.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.040]   So…
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:24.200]   - And what I'm emphasizing is because we live in a new era.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:29.920]   We live in an era where the opportunity is unlimited in almost any industry.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:36.920]   But that doesn't mean that it's easy to figure out how to find and attract and engage
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.920]   with those opportunities.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.360]   - I have a story to tell.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.360]   - Go for it.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:46.680]   - Well, I just remember now, the developer of Minecraft, he started as an independent
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.680]   developer.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:53.320]   He was super popular within PC and consoles and stuff.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:58.120]   And he just got tired of working on the game.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.880]   So he posted on Twitter, "Hey, whoever wants to buy Minecraft, let me know."
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.880]   Guess what happened?
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.640]   On the low, Microsoft contacted him.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:13.400]   He sold his company for, I think, it's a billion dollars, maybe more.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   He sold it to Microsoft.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.880]   Now, Microsoft are the owners of Minecraft.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.200]   So that same developer, he's like, "All right, I'm moving out."
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.600]   So he was trying to buy a house in LA.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.880]   And Jay-Z and Beyonce were also trying to buy that same house.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.760]   Guess who won the bid?
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.760]   He did.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.760]   A gamer.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:43.820]   A gamer beat one of the biggest music artists out there, Jay-Z and Beyonce.
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.600]   And all that was because of games.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.600]   - Wow.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.600]   Incredible.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.600]   - Crazy.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.840]   - And it shows me just how, if people are the type...
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.720]   If you take something and if you focus on it and you build on it, so let's say you have
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.360]   a history, I'm a gamer, and you do something with it.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.080]   Because the trouble in my mind is navigating between this.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.080]   Gaming...
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.080]   Feel free to disagree with that.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.080]   I'll make this a statement.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.840]   You tell me if I'm right or wrong.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.040]   Gaming can be an incredibly destructive influence in your life.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:19.240]   If it takes over your life and you do nothing with it, and you get obsessed with these certain
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.360]   games now for the rest of your life, that's what you're doing.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.680]   And you don't do anything with it.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.680]   But the same can be said with anything.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.800]   Anything can be destructive if it gets out of bounds.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.960]   But you can also take something that is a hobby, a passion, an enjoyment, an entertainment,
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.680]   and you can say, "Okay, I'm recognizing that I'm engaged with this.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.340]   How can I leverage this and get involved with other people?
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.000]   How can I make a contribution?"
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.040]   And that can lead to benefits for your life.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.880]   So it's a good example in my mind of saying, "Here's something that many parents have told
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.280]   their kids, 'You're never going to get a job if you're spending all your time playing video
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.280]   games.'"
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.360]   And there's a bunch of kids saying, "Look, Mom, I got a job."
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.720]   But see, it all depends on the parent.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.240]   Because I've been playing games...
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.640]   My grandmother was the one that bought me my first video game console, the Atari 2600,
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.520]   back in the '80s.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.680]   And I became addicted to games.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:18.040]   But at the same time, my mom and my dad were always focused on me going to school, go outside,
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.040]   have a life.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.440]   It all depends on the parent.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.480]   Too much of anything is not good.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:31.040]   You can't blame games for violence or all this stuff because Japan, Europe, Canada,
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.160]   there's other countries that listen to the same music, watch the same movies, they play
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:41.960]   the same games as us, and their crime rate is super, super low compared to the United
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.200]   States.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.200]   To me, in my opinion, it all depends on the parents.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.560]   You should control the kids.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.600]   If they're playing too much, tell them, "That's it.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.600]   Enough.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.600]   Take a break."
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.400]   Because I've seen situations of parents that, "Oh, they're just playing a game."
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:03.800]   Or they'll go to the store and buy a mature game for a 12-year-old.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.800]   I'm so against that.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.800]   That's not right.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.120]   Why do that?
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:12.680]   Do your research before you buy these games for your kids.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:17.520]   I think parents should do more research on that instead of just, "Oh, it's just a video
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.520]   game.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.520]   It's for kids."
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:27.440]   Tal: If you were parenting, let's just say, a 12- to 15-year-old boy or girl, and you're
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.160]   noticing an interest, an interest of video games, but you're concerned also about just
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.000]   their long-term career and life prospects, what would be some of the advice that you
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   would give as a parent to your child in that situation to help them explore their interest
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.760]   in a way that might lead to a productive career?
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:53.800]   Leo: Start with critical thinking games.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:22:01.040]   I think that will help your kid to come up with some amazing ideas that maybe eventually,
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.520]   once they get older, they might do the same thing with that.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:11.000]   Like I said, Minecraft, puzzle games like Tetris, something simple like that.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.880]   The things that people could create on those type of games is amazing.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.220]   My niece, she's almost two.
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:29.480]   She grabs her mom's phone, and she already knows which app it is for her games.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.920]   She knows what to do.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:38.360]   A dog will come out and bark and hide, and she has to go and find the dog within the
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.400]   screen.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.400]   Little things like that.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.720]   Kids, nowadays, are more advanced than when we were kids.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.200]   Technology is changing.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.000]   Do research on that.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.080]   What is the next big thing that's going to help my kid for them once they get older,
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.840]   and it will help them with school?
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.840]   Because I love puzzles.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.320]   I love critical thinking things.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.480]   And also, there's even role-playing games.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.220]   There's a lot of reading, too.
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.600]   That helps out.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:12.360]   But if you go into a store and just buy Grand Theft Auto or Madden, to me, that's more entertainment
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.840]   for an older crowd, not for a young kid.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.160]   In the industry, if you were looking...
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:24.360]   So for me, if I were a parent, and I am a parent, if I were in that situation, I would
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:30.320]   be looking and saying, "How can I train my child not to be a consumer, but to be a producer?"
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.840]   And so, in that sense, I would be looking...
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.560]   I'll tell you a couple of games.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.560]   Go for it.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.360]   Little Big Planet is for PlayStation.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.480]   It's for anybody.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.760]   Family, young and old.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.640]   They're also an area in the game.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.400]   It's a feature where people could create content, all type of games within the world of Little
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.400]   Big Planet.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.140]   They upload it for the world.
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:24:00.800]   So when you go to that section, it's called Community, you see which one is the most popular,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.640]   which one is the most rated.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.000]   That's cool because people are creating their own game.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.360]   There's another one, too, for Microsoft.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.360]   It's called Sparkle...
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.360]   Oh my God, something project.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.360]   Sparkle...
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.360]   Oh my God, I can't remember.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.360]   I apologize.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:19.840]   That's another one, too, that's pretty good for the Xbox One, where people could create
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.640]   their own games and stuff.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.640]   I think that's amazing.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:28.520]   I don't have the patience to create my own stuff, but I love going online and downloading
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.520]   that type of content.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.200]   There's always going to be new stuff from people that are young and old creating for
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.200]   the community.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.240]   I think that's the type of things that you should get for your kid.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.960]   Let's say, what do you have, a PC?
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.160]   Do you plan to get a console or no?
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.160]   No.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.160]   No?
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.120]   Or even on the phone.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.120]   Everybody has a smartphone.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.960]   There's apps that is for that, too.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.600]   I'll tell you, I struggle with this.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.240]   I'm a weirdo.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.240]   I don't have a TV.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.480]   That's fine.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.520]   I have a computer.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.960]   I don't have any gaming console.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.960]   That's fine.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.240]   I have a computer, but I don't have a game on it.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.720]   There's not a single game on my cell phone.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.040]   PC or Mac?
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.040]   PC.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.040]   Okay.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:16.320]   My wife and I talk a lot about how we're going to help our children integrate with technology.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:25.480]   It annoys me intensely how many parents use the phone, primarily a phone or iPad, as a
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.160]   way to babysit their kids.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.080]   And so, I can't stand it.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:35.940]   But on the other hand, I look at it from a perspective and I say, recognizing that my
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.640]   children's peers are growing up as your niece, we're at two years old, she knows how to get
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.520]   mom's phone and play this game.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.440]   And she's also really active.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.840]   Her mom takes her out.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.760]   She's not always 24/7 on the phone.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.000]   And that's like I said before, it all depends on the parents.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.640]   So you're doing the right way with your kids.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.320]   There are some values for me that are important.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.440]   So a simple thing like conversation.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:06.700]   So I work very hard not to be on my phone if I'm with my children.
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.520]   There are obviously times where if I'm at a point where this is when I need to spend
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.600]   a few minutes doing something, then I need to do that.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.840]   But if I'm with my family, I'm not going to be checking my phone.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.080]   I'm not going to be on voice mail.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.880]   I don't want that because in my mind, the higher value is the social engagement.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.320]   And I don't want my wife to feel like here I am staring at my phone.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.320]   That doesn't do good for my marriage.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.800]   I find that very disrespectful when people do that.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:38.240]   So I also feel when I look at teaching children, for example, I don't want to give my son a
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.900]   phone and say, "Okay, here, mommy and daddy are going to talk with our friends.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.900]   You can be on your phone."
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:49.320]   Rather, I want to teach my son to engage with us and to listen.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.160]   And he's doing a great job.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.720]   He's to the point where he can sit and he's not listening, obviously, and engaging with
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.000]   the conversation yet, but he can sit quietly.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.240]   And that's the skill that I want to teach, the social skills.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:05.000]   And so in my mind, I see I'm one of those pretty hardcore.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.720]   I'm a scoffer at video games.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.280]   I'm a critic of video games.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.600]   I just say, "What is the point of why would I waste my life with these things?"
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.200]   But I'm also trying to learn to vet to-
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.480]   To find a value from that.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.360]   Yeah, and to consider that because I don't want to just be the person who just dismisses
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.640]   things out of hand.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.360]   I want to consider the subject, which is why I brought you on.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.960]   And also, with my children, I recognize the benefits of it.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:36.240]   And I get concerned about people's ability to maintain long-form linear thought.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.760]   So I've found even over the last 10 years, my ability to concentrate and focus has plummeted
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.680]   from when I could sit and read books without even getting distracted.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.860]   And now, it's constantly another distraction.
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:52.280]   So I'm looking at my son and I'm thinking, "How do I train him to be able to focus and
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.980]   to be able to concentrate?
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:58.680]   And are these influences positive or are they negative or are they neutral?"
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.480]   And it's how we benefit him.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.880]   And I don't know the answers.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.880]   I blame the media, man.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:13.400]   Honestly, I blame the media because they always promote the negative part of gaming.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.040]   Those mainstream games, where are the independent games?
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.720]   Where's the success story about Minecraft?
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:29.240]   I learned about that because within the community and the news outlets within the gaming world.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.240]   It's like-
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.640]   Times have changed.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:40.240]   It's like those old school people that have their own show on the radio.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:47.480]   When they look at us, we're doing this digitally and they're like, "Ah, whatever, podcasts."
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.920]   Like, "Harmon Stern, you can't make money with podcasts."
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.880]   And yes, there is a way to make money.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.400]   I feel that you should give it a chance with the whole gaming stuff.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.400]   Try it out.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.840]   Do research and find the right games that will be perfect for your kids.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.000]   Don't worry about the popular ones.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.920]   Look for those hidden gems out there that's created by an independent developer.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.520]   At the same time, critical thinking games.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.880]   Honestly, it's so, so important.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:26.120]   There's even research that say that it's good for kids to play games because of those
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.440]   puzzles.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:35.040]   And then it used to be harder for me when I was a kid because those games you couldn't
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.040]   save.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:43.280]   I had to leave my Nintendo on because once I turn it off, I have to go and start from
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.280]   scratch.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:51.000]   Nowadays, because of technology, now I could save it, pause it, play a month later.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.540]   So technology is changing.
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:58.120]   Do the research and I think you should give it a chance for your kids.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.920]   And this came to me as you were talking.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.320]   It's not like I've never played games.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.960]   When I was younger, we had Flight Simulator.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.080]   We enjoyed that.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:15.000]   I got into at one point this motorcycle game called Full Throttle.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.640]   And it was a PC game and it was interesting.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.480]   The character was going around and you had to figure out all these clues and solve the
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.320]   puzzles and I really enjoyed that.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.080]   And also for a time, I enjoyed playing Age of Empires.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.600]   - Age of Empires, that's a big one.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.800]   - That one I really enjoyed.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.280]   That appealed to me and it's just kind of cool.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.360]   - So you were already older and everything, right?
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.720]   - Yeah, this is probably middle school age and we had a computer.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.320]   We didn't ever have any gaming consoles but we had a computer and so we would play some
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.320]   computer games from time.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.320]   - I tell you this.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:50.360]   I met my staff members because of gaming.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:56.480]   We were playing on Xbox Live online throughout different games and that's how I met them.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:02.800]   I met all my listeners was through playing online with other games or meeting them in
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.800]   person and stuff.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.800]   Now, I totally forgot what I was going to say.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:11.680]   - I'll give you another thing to jump on.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.920]   But I see the benefits of games and if you look at the research, so the military is using
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.440]   games to train soldiers and different people to train things.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.640]   And so I look at it from the perspective of finance and I've played board games.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.200]   Robert Kiyosaki has a board game called Cashflow Quadrant.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.120]   It's games like Monopoly.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.640]   These are board games that teach important aspects of finance.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:36.600]   And so I've been thinking, okay, is there a way that we could integrate and I could
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:44.280]   teach one of the ideas on my someday maybe list is could I create a video game that was
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.480]   interesting to play that taught financial independence as a way to actually convey those
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.480]   things.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.960]   - I remember what I was going to say but let me go with this because you just mentioned
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.960]   that.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:59.720]   Back in the 90s, there was this game called Sim City.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.000]   I was so addicted to that game.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.080]   And it was, okay, you are a mayor of the city and you have to build the city and you got
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:15.480]   to make sure that you have enough money to continue work on other things in the city.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.280]   So eventually there's going to be like fire, so you got to make sure you have like a fire
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.440]   department close to the area where that happened.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.600]   There's going to be another area that's a lot of crime.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.560]   Okay, let me see if I have enough money.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:30.440]   Okay, I could build a police station right here.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.440]   Things like that.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:36.120]   And at the same time, you learn how to balance the money.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.960]   You got to make sure that people are happy with their jobs within the game too.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.280]   Like, it's a lot of things.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.280]   - So it's population control.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.280]   - Yeah, but it's cool.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.280]   It's cool.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   And you know what?
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.760]   I feel like destroying an area to save money, you can do it in a game like that.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.760]   So yeah, it's a very old school Super Nintendo game.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.600]   I think that was also for PC.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.120]   It's called Sim City.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.120]   Very cool.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:05.960]   Oh, another thing too is that the reason why I like gaming so much, there's been times
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.720]   in the past that I used to be bullied when I was a kid, you know how it is in school
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.840]   and stuff.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:16.960]   But when I get home and I start playing, it released my stress.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.800]   And I feel that a lot of listeners, they feel the same way too.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.760]   The stress with work, with school.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:26.320]   And they'll go and listen to our show, and we're entertaining them.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.680]   And at the same time, we're changing their lives.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:40.600]   One kid, a foster kid, got an email that she discovered our show, and she loved it so much.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.920]   She was like, "Wow, I didn't know there was a video game podcast."
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.920]   She loved it so much.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:49.320]   Now, she wants to be a video game designer.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.880]   Stories like that makes me so happy, because you never know who's listening.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.720]   You're changing people's lives out there.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.720]   So yeah.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:03.880]   If you were speaking to parents who were saying, "Okay, I'm looking for a way, a challenge
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.720]   a lot of parents have is how do I connect with my kids?"
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.280]   It's very easy for parents to feel disconnected from their kids.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:14.680]   Their kids have the headset on, playing on Xbox Live, and mom and dad are saying, "I
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.400]   want to play with them too."
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.680]   What would be some advice you have?
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.600]   Are there certain games that they would enjoy together?
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.600]   There's so many.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.320]   There's so many, because there's games that I know is for me.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.240]   And there's games that I love to play with my girlfriend.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:30.320]   She's a casual gamer, but when she plays, she's like, "Let's focus.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.320]   Let's do this."
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:36.160]   But at the same time, what happens if you have your family over?
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.160]   Play karaoke.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.160]   There's a rock band.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.160]   Everybody has an instrument.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:44.400]   Piano, drums, guitar, bass, karaoke too.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.840]   There's different games where everybody could play.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:53.640]   Also, let's say a father, son, wants to get together and play the Lego games.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:57.600]   Beautiful, beautiful, and it's so much fun.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.560]   There's Marvel Lego.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.560]   There's Star Wars.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.720]   There's different type of games that it's perfect to play multiplayer and you will work
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.800]   together past bosses and all that stuff.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.680]   Those are the games I truly, truly recommend to play with your family.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.680]   Final question.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.960]   I just finished a book called You Only Have to Be Right Once.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:23.720]   In that book, it was talking about the guy who invented or who collaborated with others
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.920]   to build the virtual reality headset.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.920]   Oculus.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.920]   Oculus Prime.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.920]   Oculus.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.920]   The VR.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.920]   Oculus Rift.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.920]   Right?
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.920]   Oculus Rift.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.920]   Isn't that the name of the VR?
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.920]   Yes.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.920]   Have you had a chance to engage with that?
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.920]   No.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.920]   My staff had and they love it.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:41.920]   They love it.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.000]   There's so many of those right now from different companies.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.480]   There's Oculus, which Facebook purchased them.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.000]   They started as a Kickstarter company.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   It's an amazing story.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   I just heard the story.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.040]   That was one of the things.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.120]   I just finished that as we record this.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.120]   It's the end of July.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.000]   I just finished that book last week.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.800]   That story stood out to me because it demonstrated what I see as the amazing potential future
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.800]   careers that are there.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:14.360]   The story was, I can't remember if he was in a school or if he was educated at home.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.440]   I think he was educated at home.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:20.400]   He enjoyed video games and he enjoyed tinkering with things.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.280]   He got interested in virtual reality.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:27.560]   He started buying all these headsets and things on eBay from '80s and '90s and cobbling them
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.560]   together.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:34.880]   Then he got engaged with a ... He also was participating in some message boards online
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.520]   sharing some of his ideas.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.160]   He was part of a community.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.960]   He was cobbling together hardware.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:45.700]   He did a couple of Kickstarters, which funded some of the things.
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:51.040]   He got connected to somebody at a big video game company because of his involvement in
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.040]   a message board.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.960]   He had sent over a prototype.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.680]   These people were interacting.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:03.960]   Here's this 19-year-old young man who is engaged with the leaders, the chief game designers
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.800]   at Sony and these different places like that.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:13.120]   It just blows the old paradigm of build a resume and send your resume out after a college
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.120]   degree.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.120]   It blows that out of the water.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:23.760]   For people that are creators, there's no barrier between the head of games at Sony and that.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.400]   Then, yeah, he wound up selling it to, I guess, Facebook for over a billion.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.760]   -Why do you think Facebook bought that?
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.780]   It wasn't because of Only Games.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:37.680]   They could use that as, "Hey, watch a movie.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.040]   Have a video chat with your family.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.120]   Go check out the house."
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.960]   Long distance communication.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.120]   There's so many different reasons why they bought that.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:52.600]   They see the potential of this, more than just gaming.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:56.440]   I'm excited and curious to see because there's so many other companies doing it too.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.320]   Valve, they're releasing their VR this holiday.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:06.040]   Oculus, they're releasing theirs, I believe, sometime spring of next year.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:15.160]   Sony, they have another one called Morpheus, which I believe is coming out 2016 or 2017.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:24.040]   Microsoft, they have one called HoloLens, which is also pretty cool.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.040]   Really, really cool.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.040]   -It's exciting.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.440]   -It's exciting.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:32.320]   I'm telling you, one person changed the game, then everybody, "Okay, we got to make it better."
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.320]   I'm excited for that.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.320]   Competition is good.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.360]   -Well, Danny, I've loved hearing your story.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.240]   I'm excited for your future.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.240]   It's just exciting.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:46.360]   Anytime I've seen you talk about games, I've just watched your eyes light up.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.360]   -I get excited.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.360]   -It's obvious.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.160]   Your eyes light up, your whole body gets into it.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:56.920]   I just think it's an amazing world that we live in where you can be involved in this
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.920]   as an industry.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.920]   -We met at the meetup.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.240]   -Podcasts on Florida meetup.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:05.560]   When I mentioned that it was a video game podcast, people were like, "Really?
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.080]   A gamer?"
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:14.800]   But when I start talking about my story, how I started, and I started small and then eventually
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.720]   now we're big, huge, it's crazy.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.720]   It doesn't matter what type of content it is.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:26.880]   If you do it the right way, unique and different that gets people's attention, your product,
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.440]   your podcast, whatever it is, is going to get attention and get a lot of support.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.120]   You could also start a business after that.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.120]   So you never know.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.120]   You never know what could happen.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:39.240]   All I'm saying is be patient and just keep on working.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:44.280]   -That's what I thought in your presentation, both as a compliment to you and also to make
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:49.000]   the point that you made in the presentation that you presented to our local group.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.320]   You emphasized a couple of things that were very important.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:55.400]   Number one, you ignored the get big quick.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.400]   -You know where the...
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.560]   -Yeah, you ignored that nonsense.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.920]   You ignored the get big quick mindset and you demonstrated it.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.480]   It's been 10 years you've been doing this thing.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   Your show is a weekly show?
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   -Weekly show.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.040]   -Yeah, for 10 years you've been doing that.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:11.320]   -And I mean we have breaks here and there, but this year we haven't had no break.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.600]   And this has been the biggest year.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:18.240]   Tonight I'm getting inducted to the Podcast Hall of Fame.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.240]   I wasn't expecting that.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:25.320]   When they told me the news, I was in shock because they put me with Adam Curry, Leo Laporte,
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.880]   Todd Cochran.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.760]   It's crazy.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:34.880]   So that's why I always tell people, "Look, I'm not nothing special.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:38.480]   If I could do this, you guys could do the same thing too.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.160]   Stop following trends.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.160]   You start the trend.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.360]   Be a leader."
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:50.040]   And we'll see what happens because once the doors open for one person, I feel that's going
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.280]   to help everybody.
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:56.600]   We got to contribute to make this space even more mainstream, more popular.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.080]   Don't follow the ones that have been successful.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.040]   Don't copy them.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.600]   Why not do something?
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.720]   Be influenced by them.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.720]   That's cool.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.320]   But do something different.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.320]   Make it better.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.900]   Be better than me.
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:15.040]   Every time I do a panel or one of those speaking stuff, I always mention that to people.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.320]   I want to be excited about it.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:22.800]   I still feel like the same person from 2001 when I started the whole working, meeting
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.640]   people, super excited.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:29.200]   So yeah, be better than me and make this thing exciting.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:35.480]   When I see Mark Maron entering the President Obama, even if you don't agree with Obama
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.520]   or not, that is opening doors for a lot of things.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:42.400]   Glenn Beck was going to be here for Podcast Movement.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.040]   I'm not a fan of his, but I was like, "You know what?
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:50.840]   I'm going to go and see what he has to say about what he's been doing with this thing."
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:55.640]   So the more we see people contributing, doing things that's going to help everybody, the
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.880]   space is going to grow and we're going to get more listeners.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.520]   So keep doing your thing.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:03.480]   And the other thing is what shines through.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.920]   Your number one loyalty is to your audience.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.480]   That shines through in everything.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.480]   More than anything.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.480]   More than money.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.480]   More than anything.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.480]   Because look, money comes and goes.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.640]   Your community is going to stick with you to the end.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.960]   It's that simple.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.160]   I built this organically.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:24.160]   Our listeners, as a matter of fact, today I invited them.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.120]   We're going to have a little meet up.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:31.080]   Maybe like 10 to 15 people coming locally from Dallas, Fort Worth.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:35.080]   And I want them to walk with me to the red carpet.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:41.400]   And the reason why is because I got here because of them and I want them to feel that they're
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.960]   also part of our journey.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:48.240]   So when I go on stage, I'm going to thank them 100%.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:52.760]   You guys are the ones that inspired me to continue.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.600]   And I love getting emails and voicemails from people, man.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.440]   From all over the world.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:03.320]   People in the military in Japan or a listener called us from Australia.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.280]   He's like, "Look, I don't care how much I have to pay.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.920]   I just want to be part of this show."
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:09.920]   Kids young and old.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.240]   Even parents saying, "Look, I love the show.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:18.080]   I love listening to the show with my kid because you guys don't curse and it's very entertaining."
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.640]   Little things like that makes me want to continue to do my thing.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.120]   And yeah, I'm happy with the money that we've been getting.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.120]   It's cool.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.120]   But that to me is more powerful.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.120]   It's special to me.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:33.640]   So I'm not going to take away from what you said by saying anything more than thank you
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.640]   for coming on, Danny.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.640]   But thanks a lot.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.640]   I had a blast.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.640]   This is a great conversation, man.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.880]   High five.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.280]   So now if anybody ever tells you that you can't make a living playing video games, you
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.600]   now have a podcast interview to send to them.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:54.440]   Although I didn't ask Danny how much money he's making from the podcast and he didn't
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.600]   feel it necessary to share.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.080]   But he is splitting whatever revenues there are of the show with a team of four.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.080]   So recognize that.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.600]   He is still working.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.600]   But focus.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:09.040]   Notice just what an awesome opportunity he had by simply pursuing something that he was
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.400]   interested in and then becoming involved.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.080]   He got involved in the industry.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.440]   He got involved in as a commentator.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.800]   He got connected.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.400]   And that's opened up some really incredible doors for him.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:24.960]   It sounds to me like he's enjoyed every minute and he deserves the success.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:31.760]   Notice 10 years of hard work to arrive where he's at now.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.560]   But I believe his future will be bigger than his past.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.560]   Use it as an example for you.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.000]   Is there an industry that you are really into?
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Is there a game?
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   Is there a community?
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   If not, start one.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Start a community.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.560]   If there is a community, get it involved.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.560]   Become a leader.
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:46.560]   Start the podcast.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.560]   Start the blog.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.560]   Start the YouTube channel.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.560]   Go to the conference.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.560]   Meet people in person.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.560]   Start the local meetup group.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.560]   Do something.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.000]   Edit the industry magazine.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.160]   Do something to get involved and you never know where things can turn out.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:00.520]   Not everything has to be all about the money and there are some pretty cool options and
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:06.200]   things that can open up for you regardless of really what you're doing.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.860]   Thank each and every one of you for listening today.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:15.120]   Thank you especially to the patrons because of being able to count on your specific financial
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.960]   support that that's why I was able to even go to this conference and I thank you for
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:20.960]   that.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.960]   If you're not a patron, consider becoming one.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.200]   I would greatly appreciate it.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.200]   You can support the show directly.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:30.480]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron for all the details, all the bribes that I've
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.480]   got set up for you.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.480]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.800]   More interviews coming in the future.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.280]   I did some in-depth financial interviews.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.000]   I did some interesting career interviews.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.640]   This one is kind of more of just a fun one.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:43.640]   Talk about video games.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.800]   Who doesn't want to talk about video games?
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:52.960]   I figure that's one of the massive aspects of audience I decided to start with the topic
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.600]   that I thought you all would enjoy listening.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.600]   Be back with you soon.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:55.880]   Thank you so much.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:01.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:06.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.180]   (upbeat music)
