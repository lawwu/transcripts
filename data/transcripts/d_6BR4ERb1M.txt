[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   We close the week with a question from a listener named Bob.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.040]   Pastor John, I struggle with understanding what the Bible teaches on grace and how I
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.000]   should live in light of this wonderful gift.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.040]   I've been taught to be killing sin or it will be killing me, but I've also been taught
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.720]   to relax, that there is grace enough in the Holy Spirit to take care of us.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.440]   This all makes my head spin and seems a bit dangerous for how comfortable I can get with
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.440]   my own sin.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.520]   I know that we should not sin so that grace abounds, but then how ought we to live?
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.920]   What's a biblical view of grace in our sanctification?
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:38.640]   There are some head-spinning things in the Bible, and one of the callings of teachers
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.160]   and one of the hopes I have for this podcast is I can keep his head from spinning off.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:53.360]   The first thing I think I should do is clarify what might be a slight distortion of the meaning
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.560]   of God's grace in the way the question is posed.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:06.240]   Bob asks or contrasts the work of killing sin with a kind of relaxation.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.480]   He contrasts the work of killing sin with a kind of relaxation that seems to say that
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.960]   grace is what you're enjoying when you relax, but something else is operating when you're
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.280]   working or striving.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.360]   He says, "But I've also been taught to relax.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.680]   There's grace enough in the Holy Spirit to take care of us."
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:38.000]   Well, yes, and a lot of people have that view, and the problem with it biblically is that
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.280]   grace in the New Testament is not just the gift of restfulness, but the power of God
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.040]   to enable us to strive for holiness and work for holiness.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.280]   For example, 1 Corinthians 15.10, "By the grace of God, I am what I am, and His grace
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.760]   toward me was not in vain.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:03.080]   On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.680]   of God that is with me."
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.640]   So the first thing I want to say to Bob is don't frame the question that way.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.260]   Don't say that the Bible sometimes teaches us to strive and sometimes teaches us to be
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.560]   relaxed in grace.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:30.000]   Rather say, how, Pastor John, do we put together the biblical exhortations to strive and work
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.440]   and fight by grace with the biblical exhortations to rest and be content in grace?
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.760]   That's the head spinner.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.040]   That's the real head spinner for anybody who reads the Bible carefully.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.760]   So the New Testament says things like, and he knows this, he's citing them, Hebrews
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.480]   12.14, "Strive for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord."
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.600]   And Romans 8.13, "By the Spirit, put to death the deeds of the body."
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.360]   And Luke 13.24, "Strive to enter through the narrow door.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.800]   For many, I tell you, will seek to enter, will not be able."
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.640]   Now right there in Luke 13.24, those words of Jesus, there's a clue.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:30.640]   At least it points to a clue of how it is that people who are justified by faith alone
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.120]   and who believe they are secure in Christ and will make it to heaven by God's grace,
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.760]   how do those people go through the narrow door?
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.960]   How do they strive?
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.760]   And the reason I say it's a clue is because there's a parallel in Matthew 7.13-14, which
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.840]   says this, "Enter by the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is easy that
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.960]   leads to destruction.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:09.840]   And those who enter by it are many, for the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.200]   to life, and those who find it are few."
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.160]   Now that sounds, "Whoa, good night.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.960]   Christian life is just hard, narrow, work, strive."
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.880]   Yes, however, four chapters later in Matthew, that's why I think Matthew's the best help
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.400]   here is because you're dealing in the same gospel with the same Jesus talk in the same
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:43.640]   language, Matthew 11.28-30, "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.680]   give you rest.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:54.520]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you'll
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.840]   find rest for your souls."
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.280]   You just feel it being lifted, right?
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:08.600]   Verse 30, "For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:19.040]   So in Matthew 7.14, the way is hard that leads to life, and in Matthew 11.30, the yoke of
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.840]   Jesus is easy and light.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.080]   So I get why his head is spinning.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.600]   My head spins.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.840]   One of the greatest questions in life is how those fit together, and you may take a lifetime
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.880]   to live it, if not learn it.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.320]   And here's my suggestion for how I put those together anyway, and you can think it through
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.760]   on your own.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:51.560]   The fight, the striving, the narrow, the hard, the work, the warfare is not a striving to
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.920]   get Christ or to earn salvation.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.880]   It is a striving precisely to rest.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.340]   Now I know that sounds like a contradiction, but think of it this way.
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:15.800]   When Jesus calls us to come to him and rest, he means rest in him.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.280]   Find your soul resting in him.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.840]   We are to find Jesus to be our rest, or to use different words, and it's important to
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.360]   use these words, find Jesus to be our contentment.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.400]   Find Jesus to be our peace.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.240]   Find Jesus to be our satisfaction.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.840]   That's what Jesus is for us, and he's bidding us come and find him to be that for us.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:55.640]   And when Jesus is becoming that for us in large measure, that is our victory over competing
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.720]   pleasures of sin.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.700]   And therefore, it is warfare.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:09.600]   The way we kill sin, the way we successfully strive and work to put sin to death is by
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:16.720]   doing whatever it takes to be more happy in Jesus, more restful in Jesus, more content
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.600]   and satisfied in Jesus than in sin.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.580]   So all striving, all working, all fighting is a striving and working and fighting to
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:33.160]   rest, to be content, to be satisfied, to be happy in Jesus.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.120]   This is the only way of gospel sanctification.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:44.680]   If you don't put to death sinful temptation by a superior satisfaction in Jesus, but only
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:50.560]   by your willpower, then you're going to get the glory and not Jesus, and that's not biblical
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.560]   sanctification.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:08:00.080]   1 Peter 4, 11, "Let him who serves serve in the strength that God supplies, so that in
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.520]   everything God may get the glory through Jesus."
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.920]   So how do we strive and work and fight to serve God?
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:16.720]   Answer, by receiving, by receiving power, grace from God so that God gets the glory.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.960]   And that power flows through faith, faith in God's promises.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:29.160]   And the essence of faith in promises is being satisfied in the promises, trusting in the
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.920]   promises, resting in the promises, being content in the promises.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:42.120]   And that satisfaction is the rest of Matthew 11.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:48.480]   So the reason Jesus says it's hard is because we love sin.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.020]   We don't love to rest.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.320]   We love to find our satisfaction in this world and in sin.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:01.720]   And he says, "As long as you are preferring, as long as you are preferring this world over
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:08.760]   me, sin over me, then the only way for you to conceive of the Christian life is killing.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.400]   You must kill that."
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.160]   But the goal of the killing is the rest.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:22.000]   And if you are already at rest in Jesus and he is a superior satisfaction to you over
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.360]   all sin, you don't have to fight.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.360]   You're there.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.360]   But nobody's there.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:35.800]   So in this way, we fight, and every day God gives us measures of restfulness, and we defeat
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.360]   sin.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.120]   Fighting our way to true rest.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.480]   That is such a helpful way of putting this.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.480]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.960]   And thanks for the question, Bob.

[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.380]   We are going to break for the weekend, but on Monday we field a question from a mother
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.700]   of a young son who wants to know, "How do parents prepare their children for the inevitable
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.520]   suffering to come in this life?"
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.640]   Oof, that's a great question.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.640]   Don't miss it.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.640]   That's Monday.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.640]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
