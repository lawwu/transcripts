[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:12.300]   the Gospel according to St. Matthew, in the ninth chapter, reading from verse fourteen
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.080]   to verse seventeen, from verse fourteen to verse seventeen, in the ninth chapter of the
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.420]   Gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:33.480]   "Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft,
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.180]   but thy disciples fast not?
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.940]   And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.380]   is with them?
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.740]   But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.740]   fast.
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.780]   No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment; for that which is put in to fill
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.260]   it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.260]   Neither do men put new wine into old bottles, else the bottles break, and the wine runneth
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:22.820]   out, and the bottles perish; but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved."
[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.620]   Now, those who come here constantly and regularly will realize that we are continuing a number
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.900]   of studies in this ninth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:43.140]   Each of these incidents follows upon the previous one, and I'm calling attention to them because
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.540]   here, it seems to me, and as I'm trying to show, we have a series of incidents which
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:58.300]   can give us very vital and essential teaching and instruction with regard to the most urgent
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.540]   problem confronting everybody who's alive in this world at this moment, and that is
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.140]   how to become a Christian.
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.780]   I say that that is the most urgent and the most important question that anybody can consider
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.460]   at a time such as this.
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.880]   I needn't take your time again in elaborating that.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.300]   The whole uncertainty of life, we know not what tomorrow will bring forth, should surely
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.740]   compel all thinking people to ask certain fundamental questions.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.740]   What is life?
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:43.880]   What's its object, what's its purpose, what's it all meant to lead to, what's death, what
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.780]   happens after death, if anything?
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.220]   These are the questions, surely, that any thinking person should be pondering with a
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:01.540]   new seriousness and, as I say, a new urgency at a terribly cruel time such as this.
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.420]   And that is why I say, in calling attention to these incidents one after another, there
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:16.340]   is only one hope, and that is that we be reconciled to God, that all is well between us and God,
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.380]   for we're all under God, we're all in the hands of God, and we shall all have to stand
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.740]   before God and give an account of our stewardship of the most precious gift that he's ever given
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.020]   to mankind, namely, the soul that is within us.
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.940]   And therefore there is nothing more important, I say, than to know how exactly we approach
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.260]   the Lord Jesus Christ, who alone can bring us to God and reconcile us to him.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.020]   How can we come to know him?
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.100]   How is he to be approached, or if you like it more generally?
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.300]   The problem before us is, what is this Christianity?
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.380]   What is this message?
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.420]   What does it mean exactly to be a Christian?
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.140]   Now, we've been looking at these incidents and we've seen something of their teaching.
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.540]   There are a series of different incidents which on the surface appear to be quite different
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.940]   from one another, and yet we've seen up to date that all of them ultimately come to exactly
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.660]   the same thing.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.100]   There are certain initial misconceptions with regard to the Lord Jesus Christ himself, with
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.120]   regard to his teaching, with regard to what is meant, in other words, by Christianity
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.900]   and the Christian faith.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.700]   And it's extraordinary how these follow one upon another.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.420]   The first incident was that where four men brought a friend of theirs who was paralyzed.
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.020]   They carried him on a mattress.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.540]   They'd heard of Christ and in their utter despair, they said, "We must take him to him.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.500]   If anybody can do anything, this is the only one."
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.140]   But they found a great crowd.
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.660]   Nevertheless, they were so insistent upon this, they climbed up, tore a hole in the
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.340]   roof, let the man down before our Lord, and our Lord dealt with him, and the man went
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.340]   away blessed.
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.940]   And the second incident was the call of Matthew the Publican.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.180]   He wasn't seeking, he was just doing his work, sitting at the receipt of custom with his
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.740]   books, collecting the taxes.
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:22.100]   Suddenly our Lord addresses him and says, "Follow me."
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.820]   And he arose and followed him, got the same blessing exactly.
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.820]   Then last Sunday night, you remember, we were dealing with this difficulty that seemed to
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.620]   arise in the minds of the Pharisees and others.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.780]   Our Lord went into Matthew's house at his request and invitation to have a meal, and
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.340]   there were a number of other publicans invited, friends of Matthew, and other publicans came,
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.940]   and sinners, open, flagrant sinners.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.340]   And when the Pharisees saw this, they were amazed, and they said, "Why eateth your master
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.380]   with publicans and sinners?"
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:03.300]   And our Lord, you remember, turned upon them and gave that great reply that we were considering
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.980]   together, "They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick."
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.980]   And finally, I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.020]   Same thing again, but the approach was somewhat different.
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.700]   Well, now we go on to yet another incident this evening, where we are told that the disciples
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:30.140]   of John the Baptist came to our Lord and put a question to him.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:39.140]   And their question was this, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, frequently, and
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.540]   thy disciples don't fast at all?
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.980]   Why is this?"
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.860]   And Jesus said unto them, "Can the children of the bride chamber mourn as long as the
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.380]   bridegroom is with them?
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:59.460]   But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.100]   fast, and then follow the two parables that I read just now."
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.380]   Well, now here I say, the great theme goes on.
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.740]   It's the same matter exactly as I want to show you, but you see the introduction's different.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.980]   And this is the point that I'm making.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.820]   Aren't you impressed as you read a chapter like this, or as indeed you read the whole
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:29.340]   of the four Gospels, are you not impressed sometimes at the extraordinary number of possible
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.060]   misunderstandings of this Gospel?
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.300]   Has that ever struck you?
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.300]   This is what we've got.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.660]   Here's the Son of God incarnate.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.220]   He's come to bless.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.100]   He spent the whole of his time doing good, healing diseases and sicknesses, being kind
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.500]   in various ways.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:53.500]   Here he is, the incomparable teacher, and yet so much of his time is taken up in this
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:59.020]   kind of answering of questions, altercations, arguments, and disputations.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.460]   People come to him one after another, "Why is this criticizing?"
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.940]   And so much of his time, his brief time here as a teacher on earth, was taken up, and as
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:15.220]   it appears at first sight to us, wasted in dealing with these various people.
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.360]   But it wasn't wasted.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:24.820]   His answers are always of the most vital importance, because men and women are still kept from
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:30.100]   Christ and Christianity for precisely these same reasons.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.540]   And there can be no doubt that this is why, in the wisdom of God, these records were ever
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.940]   written and have been preserved for us.
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:45.940]   I say that as you read these records, you seem to come to the conclusion that people
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:51.660]   are ready to take up almost anything, to object to our Lord and his teaching.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:59.460]   They're prepared to stumble at practically anything and everything that he was or ever
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.460]   said.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:05.460]   Now, here we've got an instance of it tonight, which is quite a remarkable one, indeed an
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.420]   extraordinary one.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:14.460]   Last time, it was the Pharisees who came and had their difficulty and their objection.
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:19.260]   But this time, it's the disciples of John the Baptist.
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.740]   And John the Baptist was the forerunner of our Lord and Savior.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.580]   He was the one who went before him, preparing the way.
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.620]   And when people turned to him and said, "Are you not the Messiah?"
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.860]   He said, "No, I'm not.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.740]   I'm not worthy to undo the lecher of his shoes.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.500]   He is coming after me.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.140]   I'm simply the one who goes before him."
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:45.460]   Well now, here is the one John the Baptist who said, "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.940]   away the sin of the world."
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:53.780]   And yet, it's the disciples of John, of all people, those who should have been on his
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.700]   side and understanding it all, they are the very people who come here and put this question,
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:06.860]   "Why is it," they say, "that we and the Pharisees are constantly observing days of fasting,
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.700]   and your disciples never fast at all?"
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.020]   Now, they stumbled at this, and they were annihilated by it.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:20.940]   They stumbled at our Lord himself, at his behavior, and obviously at the teaching which
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.620]   he had been giving to his followers.
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:28.980]   Well now then, on the surface I say, this appears to be an entirely different case,
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.420]   doesn't it?
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.900]   And yet, as we come now to examine it, we shall find that fundamentally it is exactly
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.260]   the same as the previous cases.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:42.100]   Indeed, this is the great point I'm establishing.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:50.220]   That all difficulties with regard to believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and becoming a Christian,
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:59.940]   all of them ultimately are due to one and the same thing, and that is some initial misconception
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:08.500]   or some prejudice with regard to him and his teaching, with regard to what Christianity
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.900]   really is.
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.820]   Now that's always the trouble.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:18.220]   It may start here, there, or anywhere else, but if you follow it along, you'll always
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.900]   find you can track it back to that initial trouble.
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.460]   All these people with their varying questions and their difficulties and their problems,
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.660]   they all, I say, arise from this one common thing.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:38.980]   They've all got a wrong notion, an erroneous conception, as to what this faith and its
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.060]   teaching really are.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.620]   No, that's precisely what we've got here.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.820]   And our Lord deals with it.
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.860]   He always dealt with these questions, as he dealt with the Pharisees, so he deals with
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.700]   the disciples of John.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:57.300]   He first of all gives them a plain, explicit statement and answer.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:05.700]   And then obviously feeling that this matter was so serious, so important, so vital, he
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:12.180]   supplemented his plain, obvious answer by uttering two parables.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:18.460]   And in the two parables he makes the thing still more abundantly plain and clear.
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.140]   Now what is his teaching?
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.140]   What does he say?
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:27.260]   Well, the point, the real essence of the teaching, both in the statement and in the parables,
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:41.220]   is this, that he and his gospel and his message are entirely new and unique, and utterly unlike
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.100]   everything that the world has ever known before.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:51.020]   Now there is our great fundamental principle.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:57.700]   It is because he, and what he has come to do, and what he's come to say, is so different
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:04.460]   from what people normally think, that they get into trouble with respect to it.
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.940]   That was the trouble with these disciples of John the Baptist.
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:13.700]   I say that is exactly and precisely the whole trouble this evening.
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.180]   Now let's look at this together.
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:23.340]   Here is, I say, our central principle, our Lord deals with it in a very exhaustive manner.
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.780]   I can't hope to do that tonight.
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:31.380]   I'm going to take first of all this explicit statement which he made.
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:36.020]   When he put it like this, Jesus said unto them, "Can the children of the bride chamber
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:41.620]   mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:47.700]   But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.380]   fast."
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.020]   Now what is he teaching?
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.420]   Well let's be clear about this.
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:59.860]   He is not merely making some general statement about the advance of knowledge.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.380]   This matter we are dealing with tonight has so often been completely misinterpreted.
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.460]   And people have said, "Ah yes, of course, the truth of the 20th century is not the truth
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.660]   of the 19th century, the 18th century, always new.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.900]   You must always advance.
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:17.940]   These disciples of John were old-fashioned traditionalists, and our Lord was always modern
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:23.060]   up to date, and he is not interested therefore today in theology that may have been all right
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.880]   at the time of the Protestant Reformation and so on.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.820]   We want a truth for the..."
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:32.500]   That's how this is misinterpreted, because that's completely and entirely wrong, as I
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.340]   must show.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:39.300]   Others think that he's just here saying that there's no value in the Old Testament.
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.180]   There are many people who take up that attitude, "The Old Testament finished this, Christianity
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:47.020]   put an end to it, and our Lord was just announcing the Old Testament here."
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.540]   That's a complete travesty, of course.
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.740]   He never did that.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.660]   He said that he had not come to destroy the law, the prophets, but to fulfill.
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.020]   No that's not what he's concerned about.
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:03.660]   What he's concerned about is the misunderstanding of the teaching both of the Old Testament
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.900]   and the New.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:15.140]   This constant prejudice that comes between people and belief in him and the receiving
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.980]   of his blessing.
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:23.300]   Now I ask again, haven't you often been amazed and surprised at that as you read these four
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.700]   Gospels and their accounts of his earthly life and ministry?
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.940]   Don't you have the feeling, if only I were there and I could really see him, why I'd
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.460]   fall at his feet at once and believe him, but you probably wouldn't.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.700]   If you don't believe his message now, you wouldn't have believed it then, and you would
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.740]   have refused to do so, you would have stumbled at one of the things that caused these people
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.740]   to stumble.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.740]   What are they?
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.740]   Well, let's listen to his teaching.
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.860]   This is how our Lord puts it in his reply.
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:58.020]   He starts off by saying that Christianity is always surprising.
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.780]   That's the first postulate.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:05.780]   Why do we and the Pharisees fast off, but thy disciples fast not?
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.500]   Surprise.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.700]   His replies got it equally clearly.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:16.620]   Can the children of the bride chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.700]   As if to say, you seem to have a wrong notion of who I am and what I am and what I'm doing
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.340]   here, and the whole atmosphere of what I'm doing.
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.300]   Not a chamber of mourning, this is a bridal feast.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.300]   Surprise.
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:35.900]   Now, this is, I say, a most important point.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.780]   In our previous incidents, this element of surprise has come out every time.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:46.700]   You see, the Pharisees, when they saw him sitting down at meal, at meat with a publican,
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:52.580]   indeed a number of them, and these open, obvious sinners, they said, "This is impossible.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:57.580]   A religious teacher, a man who claims to have come from God, sitting down with publicans
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.860]   and sinners, they couldn't get over this surprise.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.860]   Well, here we've got it again.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:03.860]   Disciples of John."
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.620]   They said, "But look here, you're not keeping the rules.
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.800]   You're not behaving as you should behave.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:15.300]   We and the Pharisees, and all people who are really religious, we fast oft, and your disciples
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.420]   don't fast at all."
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.380]   They were amazed at this and surprised at this.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.980]   Oh, let me emphasize this point.
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.600]   Our Lord was always surprising people.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.140]   You can't go through these records without coming across it almost on every page and
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.540]   many times on every single page.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:42.060]   If ever anybody surprised people in this world, it was the Son of God.
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:47.300]   The common people were surprised at it, amazed at it.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.300]   They said, "Who is this?
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.300]   What is this?
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.360]   A religious man speaketh with authority, not as the Pharisees and scribes, and yet he's
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.360]   only a carpenter.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.060]   He's just one of us, really, but what is this?
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.060]   Read the accounts.
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:03.780]   You'll find that wherever he came, he created a stir and a commotion the last time he went
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.780]   into Jerusalem.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.660]   The people said, 'Who is this?'"
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.740]   That was his effect upon the common people.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.540]   Well, we've already seen it in the case of the Pharisees and scribes.
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.860]   They could not understand it.
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.420]   He was a permanent enigma to them.
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:24.260]   Indeed, they were annoyed by him because he never seemed to do what they thought he ought
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.260]   to be doing.
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.380]   Up to a point, they thought at first he was going to be right, then they begin to be shocked
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.020]   by him here and there and everywhere, and they're always in trouble and asking their
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.020]   questions.
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:38.660]   But it's equally the same with the publicans.
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:44.020]   They'd always been regarded as outsiders, and they'd always been taught to believe that
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.460]   religion had got nothing for them.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.020]   Religion was for good people, not for publicans and sinners.
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:54.840]   And yet they found that when they approached him, he was delighted to receive them.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.060]   He was known as the friend of publicans and sinners, and they were amazed at it.
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.900]   They'd never had such treatment.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.300]   Poor women who'd lived a life of sin came and washed his feet.
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:10.020]   A poor woman with a desperate disease came and touched the hem of his garment, and instead
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:16.020]   of being accosted or reprimanded or rebuked as they expected, he was always loving and
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.460]   kind and tender with them, and they couldn't understand this.
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.420]   Oh, they were not the only people.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.820]   The Roman soldiers were equally surprised.
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.340]   Some of them were sent one day to arrest him.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.980]   They went back to their officers without him, and when their officers asked them, "Well,
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.980]   where's your prisoner?"
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.220]   the only thing they could say is, "There's never men spake like this man."
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:43.500]   There was something about him that they couldn't understand, something extraordinary, something
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.100]   unusual, something amazing.
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:52.540]   Indeed, let me finish the list by reminding you that even his own disciples were constantly
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.180]   being amazed by him.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.620]   Here were his own followers.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:02.220]   They thought they understood, and yet they didn't understand.
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.720]   They were amazed, we are told.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.360]   Read these accounts and watch for that expression.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.220]   They were filled with amazement.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.500]   They and the people said, "We have seen strange things today."
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.780]   There was something about him and what he did, never what they expected, but always
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.900]   something unusual that caused a surprise.
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:25.980]   And now, the principle I'm establishing is that that is always a characteristic of true
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.540]   Christianity.
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.420]   True Christianity is always surprising.
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.940]   Now, I'm sorry, I've got to use an expression like "true Christianity."
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.940]   Why?
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.980]   Well, because there is that which passes as Christianity, which is not Christianity.
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.620]   I'm talking about true Christianity.
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:50.100]   And the point I'm establishing is that the effect of true Christianity is always surprising
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.100]   and amazing.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.900]   Look at one of the most notable examples.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.980]   The day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:05.860]   Here are the people up for the religious feast from all parts of the world.
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:14.700]   Suddenly they see a handful of ignorant, unlettered, untutored men, filled with an ecstasy of joy
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:23.420]   and of happiness, praising God, speaking in different languages which they could all understand.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.300]   And they looked on in utter astonishment and amazement.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.500]   Some said these men are full of new wine, they're drunk.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:34.620]   But they all joined in saying this, "What is this?
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:40.860]   This new thing, this Christianity, it's first effect upon people was to fill them with amazement
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:45.500]   and astonishment, surprise."
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.980]   And I could easily show you in the subsequent history of the Christian church throughout
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:55.140]   the centuries that Christianity, the true Christianity, has always had that effect upon
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.140]   people.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:03.260]   Whenever there has been a reformation or a revival, it's always come in this same surprising
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.860]   and amazing manner.
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.340]   Now what was it that led to the Protestant Reformation?
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.340]   What happened to Martin Luther?
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.540]   Well, I can tell you.
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:18.500]   Here was a good young man, destined for the church, anxious to be a priest, whose main
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:25.120]   concern was to live a godly life and to be a teacher of the scriptures.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.100]   And so he gives up wonderful prospects and he becomes a monk.
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:35.180]   And there he is in his cell, studying, fasting, sweating, praying.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.180]   What's he trying to do?
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:41.700]   Well, he's trying to discover whether his sins are forgiven or not.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:47.040]   He's trying to know God and to know that all is well with his soul.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.040]   He lived for that.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:53.660]   It was the great quest of his life and he'd been at it for years.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:23:02.640]   And suddenly, and amazingly and astonishingly, through reading the scriptures themselves
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:09.060]   of which he was a teacher and a professor, he suddenly made the startling discovery that
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:15.940]   he'd been all wrong and that his whole approach was entirely fallacious.
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:21.900]   But that was not the way to be saved and to know God and to know your sins forgiven.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.420]   It was justification by faith only.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.300]   And he nearly went mad.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.260]   And it exploded into the Protestant Reformation.
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.420]   He was amazed.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:37.100]   He stumbled across it and it was so absolutely different from all he'd ever thought and all
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.540]   he'd ever been taught and everybody before him.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.700]   He never got over his amazement.
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.280]   That was the beginning of the Protestant Reformation.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.100]   And my dear friends, it's been the same ever since.
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:57.140]   This burst upon the world as a new truth in the bosom of the church.
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.140]   Everybody was amazed.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.220]   "What's this?" they said.
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.220]   Some hated it and were infuriated.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.660]   Others thanked God for it.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.620]   But you see, the effect upon all was surprise, amazement and astonishment.
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:11.160]   Oh, I could keep you with endless illustrations.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.380]   Exactly the same thing happened in the 18th century to people like George Whitefield and
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.100]   John Wesley.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.500]   John Wesley has given us that long account of it in his journals.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.500]   Go and read it.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.340]   He was, again, a good, godly young man.
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.940]   Always religious, brought up in a religious home, his father a clergyman, an exceptionally
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.700]   godly mother.
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:34.020]   His great ambition in life was to know God and to serve him and to know that all was
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.140]   well between him and God.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:42.820]   He gave up his fellowship in his college at Oxford, sacrificed wonderful prospects, crossed
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.900]   the Atlantic to preach to pagans in Georgia and America.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.900]   What's he doing?
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.300]   Trying to save his soul.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.300]   This is the way.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.380]   He'd always been brought up in it.
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.380]   This was it.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.940]   And then you remember what happened to him in the same way.
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:25:00.100]   Suddenly, he discovers it's all wrong and that this is something that God gives us,
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.780]   the free grace of God.
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.620]   And again, he was filled with amazement and astonishment.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.140]   The same with Whitefield and all.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.100]   And so, you had your great evangelical awakening.
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.180]   Every revival, every reformation, has always had this effect.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.860]   People had gone on in the humdrum manner, going to their church now and again, thinking
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.180]   they were good Christian people.
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.660]   Suddenly, the Holy Ghost comes down and the place is, as it were, turned upside down,
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:29.700]   and the power of the Spirit comes, and people say, "What's this?"
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.100]   And then they begin to ask questions and ask themselves, "Have we ever been Christians
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.100]   at all?
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.500]   Is this Christianity?
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.900]   We never knew it like this before."
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.900]   Now, that's always the effect.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.140]   Especially the effect that it had here, you see, on the disciples of John the Baptist.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:48.220]   Now, then, why does Christianity always come like this as a surprise?
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.060]   Here's the question.
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.220]   Why does it come in this way to us?
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:57.020]   And there's only one answer to the question.
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:04.620]   People are always surprised when they really discover what it is, for the one and only
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:09.220]   reason that they thought that they knew what it was.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.220]   That's the trouble.
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.940]   You see, these disciples of John, they said, "Now, we know what religion is, and this man
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.580]   claims to be a religious leader.
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:21.260]   Well, therefore, if he is a religious leader, why doesn't he make his disciples fast?
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:25.940]   They knew what religion was, and he doesn't tally with that, therefore, he's wrong."
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.060]   It's still like that.
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:33.220]   People are surprised when they really discover what this is, well, because they always thought
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.500]   they knew what it was.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:42.820]   And I'm quite sure that there are many such people in this congregation at this moment.
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:46.280]   We all think we know what Christianity is, don't we?
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.060]   That's why we all are so ready to talk about it.
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.660]   That's why we're all so ready to express our opinions about it.
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.260]   That's why we're all so ready to argue about it.
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.700]   There's not a person here who hasn't argued many times about Christianity, haven't you?
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:04.180]   You've said, "I think it's this," and you've engaged in argument and disputation.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.500]   But my dear friend, the question is, do you know what it is?
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.180]   We all think we do.
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:15.020]   We all start off feeling we know exactly what it is, and then when we come up against the
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.940]   thing itself, we say, "But that isn't right, that isn't it.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:18.940]   We think we know."
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:24.780]   And the whole time the trouble is, as we see in this incident, that we've been altogether
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.220]   and entirely wrong.
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:32.120]   I want to put this like this.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:41.260]   If this Christian message has not come to us as a surprise, we've never known it.
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:48.300]   If you're not amazed at the content of this message, I say you don't know it at all.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:54.540]   I want to put it very plainly, Christianity, the essential message, is a staggering truth.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:28:00.460]   I'll go further, it is a shocking truth to the natural men.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:09.680]   But above everybody else, it is a shocking truth to the good religious men.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.140]   These were religious people, remember, the Pharisees and scribes, the disciples of John
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.140]   the Baptist.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:23.180]   Here are religious men, good religious men, yet Christ shocks them, he staggers them.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:29.940]   And, as I've been showing you by my instances, that is what he always does, he shocked Martin
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.620]   Luther, he staggered John Wesley.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.620]   It's always had this effect.
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.860]   Who were the people who persecuted Martin Luther most of all?
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.140]   Was it the people out in the world who didn't believe?
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.140]   Not at all.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:47.020]   Martin Luther got his main persecution from the Roman Catholic Church, from religious
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.020]   people.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.940]   Who were the people who persecuted Whitefield and the Wesleys most?
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.420]   Was it the rabble?
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.740]   They did up to a point, but they did it as a joke.
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:03.140]   The people who really persecuted them were, well, I'm just repeating history, the bishops
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.380]   of the Church of England, to which they belonged as clergymen.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.540]   Their main persecution came from good religious people.
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.540]   Why?
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:15.780]   Well, because these men seemed to be preaching something that was wrong.
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:21.860]   They said this is wrong, this is impossible, this is staggering, this is shocking, this
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.420]   really isn't decent.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:29.220]   That's always been the trouble, and therefore I must put it in this form of a question once
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.780]   more.
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:38.420]   Have you been as shocked and amazed at this message?
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:44.460]   Has it come as a surprise to you, shaking you, making you feel that all you've thought
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.540]   and known is absolutely wrong?
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.100]   I say if it hasn't, you've never met it.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:55.460]   This was invariably the effect of our Lord and his teaching upon good religious people
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.380]   in his own day and generation.
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.660]   It's continued to be ever since in the history of the Church.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.060]   Very well, let's go on from that.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.480]   There's our first point, but take a second.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.700]   Why does it have this effect?
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.980]   Well, because as our Lord says, it is something which is unique.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:19.760]   Now, our Lord's picture puts that very clearly, doesn't it?
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.760]   You see, here they are.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:25.380]   They're arguing from the basis of their idea of religion and what has always been done
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:33.540]   in religious circles and in the realm of religion, and our Lord says, yes.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:41.960]   Do you expect people at a bridal feast, a marriage feast, do you expect them to mourn?
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.700]   Well, how utterly irrelevant it seems to be.
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:51.380]   We are discussing religion, and he's talking about a marriage feast.
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.380]   It's altogether different.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:58.980]   Well, that's exactly the point he's establishing, that he and his message are absolutely unique.
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:04.340]   In other words, he's saying this, that what he is and what he has to give is not in series
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:12.900]   with anything else, that it's entirely unlike everything else, that this is something that
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:17.460]   comes in, as it were, when we don't expect it, and entirely different from what we had
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.460]   anticipated.
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:23.540]   Now, that's the great point that he establishes here.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:30.040]   In other words, for me to put it in a more modern form, we can put it like this.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.620]   Christianity is not something that you can add to anything else.
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.740]   There are many people doing that.
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.540]   That's why I think things are as they are today.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:42.180]   I've known many people who thought of Christianity just like this.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:46.060]   When I was a boy, I suppose they were in the majority then, but they were quite honest
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.780]   and they were quite sincere.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:55.220]   Their idea of Christianity was this, liberalism with a kind of religious tincture upon it.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:32:00.020]   But then there were others to whom Christianity was conservatism, with a religious tincture
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.020]   upon it.
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:05.020]   And since then there have been large numbers to whom Christianity is nothing but socialism,
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.220]   with a kind of religious terminology.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.860]   That's their notion of Christianity.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:13.100]   You see, you start out with your basic belief, whatever it is, philosophical, political,
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:16.540]   or anything else, and then you borrow these Christian terms.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:22.020]   That's Christ, he just gives a religious air, a religious covering, as it were, to
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.660]   what you yourself believe.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.460]   You add it on.
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:29.300]   Or to put it in another way, their notion of it is that it's something that you can
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.860]   mix with what you've already got.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.340]   Now that was the whole trouble with these disciples of John.
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:40.260]   Here they were, religious men, disciples of John the Baptist, a religious leader, a man
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.820]   who'd baptised so many thousands out there in the wilderness.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.300]   Here they are, the religious people.
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.300]   Here comes this new teacher.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:50.980]   Well now then, they say, of course, he's one of us, he belongs to us, and they thought
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.780]   they of everybody would understand this and they'd approve most of all and would be most
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.180]   pleased by it.
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.620]   But he shocks them, he amazes them.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.700]   And he tells them why he does so.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.700]   He says, "What I've got is not to be mixed with what you've got."
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:13.940]   No, no, he says, "You've got to realize that my teaching is something absolutely unique
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.340]   in and of itself.
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.120]   It's complete in and of itself.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.500]   It's not an addition to.
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.260]   It is itself everything.
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:21.660]   It's exclusive.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.640]   It is intolerant in that sense.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.940]   It is the only teaching, and I am the one and only Messiah.
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.100]   I am the light of the world."
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.840]   Now that's his answer.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.940]   He speaks authoritatively.
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:41.780]   And he puts what he is and what he's got to give in an entirely new setting, which was
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:49.140]   completely strange to these people and to their whole outlook and all their thinking.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:53.740]   Now that leads me to the last question, which is this one.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:34:00.240]   Why is it that the uniqueness of the Christian message surprises us in this way?
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.860]   You see the steps?
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.860]   It does surprise.
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:03.860]   It shocks.
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.540]   He says it does so because of its uniqueness.
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.540]   Well, what is there about it?
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:15.380]   What is this uniqueness that always amazes people like this and pulls them up full of
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.100]   surprise and astonishment?
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:23.560]   Or in other words, what are the essential characteristics of this Christian message
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:29.700]   that put it in a category on its own and make it such that it requires no help, no addition,
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.580]   no mixture with anything else?
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.580]   What is it?
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:39.300]   And our Lord answers the question not only simply and plainly, but in a very glorious
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.960]   and in a very wonderful manner.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:46.660]   The first characteristic, he says, of his whole teaching and his gospel and his salvation
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:54.520]   is this, that it is something which is utterly and entirely dependent upon him himself.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:59.560]   Notice how he puts it.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.360]   They are interested in religious teaching.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:06.000]   Can the children of the bride chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.940]   That's in reply to the question, why do we and the Pharisees fast not and thy disciples
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:10.940]   fast not?
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.560]   His answer is to talk about a bridegroom.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.080]   Who's the bridegroom?
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   He himself.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:21.240]   Immediately, you see, he shows them that their thinking is one.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.920]   Now, they thought of him as just one of a number of religious teachers.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.920]   They had heard of the prophets in the past and so on.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.500]   They had followed John the Baptist, the most amazing of them all, the last of the great
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.500]   prophets.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.880]   Here comes another teacher.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.400]   Oh, here's just another one again.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:47.040]   But he immediately dismisses that he himself is what matters, the bridegroom.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.760]   He calls attention to his person.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:55.520]   Now, this is the first essential about us understanding this Christian message.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:00.640]   And this is what puts it into a category entirely on its own.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:07.360]   With all other teachings, the teacher is not essential.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.640]   You could have Mohammedanism without Mohammed.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.520]   You could have Buddhism without Buddha.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.360]   You could have Confucianism without Confucius.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.400]   This is the man who happened to popularize it.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.200]   But the teaching is a man-made teaching and anybody might have propounded it.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.880]   It's the teaching that matters.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.560]   The person, it doesn't save you.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.320]   It's the teaching that saves you.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.920]   Not so here.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:35.320]   The thing that separates this from everything else is that it is the teacher, the person
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:41.240]   himself who matters above and beyond everything else, the bridegroom.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.860]   He says you don't understand it, your whole thinking is wrong.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.920]   You don't realize that I'm the bridegroom.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.080]   That's why they're happy.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.440]   That's why they're not fasting.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.520]   That's why they're not mourning.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.800]   I am with them.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.080]   The bridegroom is your present.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.720]   He's calling attention to his person.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.840]   And if ever that were necessary, it is essential at the present time.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.640]   People are talking about Christianity, the Christian attitude towards this, that, and
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640]   the other.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.480]   They're turning it into a teaching and a philosophy.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:12.520]   And the blessed person himself is not in it at all.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.840]   And yet there is no Christianity without him.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.680]   Don't you see how he puts it here?
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:23.200]   Christianity is a relationship to a person.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:28.040]   While they are arguing with him about teachings, he says, look here, how can the children of
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.240]   the bride chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:37.160]   The children of the bridechamber are the friends who come and are invited to the marriage and
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.160]   to the feast.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.080]   That's his picture.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.520]   What makes them what they are?
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.360]   Is it that they hold a certain teaching or that they've done certain things?
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.360]   Not at all.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.360]   They're the friends of the bridegroom.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.120]   They're related to the person.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:52.760]   Here's the thing to start with.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.920]   Everything is controlled by him himself.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.640]   What makes a man a Christian?
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.640]   There's only one answer.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.980]   It is his relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:05.980]   You can be a good man.
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.800]   You can be the best man in the world.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:12.320]   But if you bear no direct relationship to this Jesus Christ, this bridegroom, you're
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:15.480]   not a Christian.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.480]   You can be good.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   You can be religious.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.480]   You can be anything you like.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.840]   But the vital question is, what is your relationship to this bridegroom?
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.480]   You see, he says it's central.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.480]   It's vital.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.680]   He says, while I'm here, they can't be unhappy and they can't mourn.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.580]   When I'm taken away, they will mourn.
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.640]   What determines their life?
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.640]   I.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:38.440]   It is their relationship to me that governs everything else.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.680]   Nothing else governs it.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.520]   They're in this special relationship to me and therefore, their state and condition is
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:50.120]   entirely determined by me, by what I am, and by what happens to me.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:57.120]   Here's the heart of Christianity, my friends.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:03.800]   The whole message of Christianity is to say that God has visited and redeemed his people
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:11.040]   in the person of his only begotten Son, the bridegroom, this outstanding person.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.040]   Who is he?
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.600]   Well, look at him here.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.600]   Listen to his speech.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.600]   Look at his knowledge.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.320]   Here he is forecasting his own death.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:25.600]   He says the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then they shall
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.600]   fast.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.600]   They will mourn then.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.120]   They'll be unhappy then.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.640]   The day is coming when I, the bridegroom, am going to be taken from them.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.680]   Now, here is what he's calling attention to himself, to his own person.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.400]   Who is this person who can speak like this?
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:45.760]   Who is this that arrogates to himself this special position and calls himself the bridegroom,
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:51.200]   this special person, and all people are to be influenced by him and by their relationship
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.240]   to him?
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:40:02.520]   There is the first and the most essential truth about this Christian message.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:08.440]   It is he himself that counts and matters supremely.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.880]   If you regard him as just a man, the best man, if you like, that the world has ever
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:17.280]   known and the greatest religious teacher, and no more, you're not a Christian.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.920]   He's the bridegroom.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.480]   He's the one who has come down amongst us.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.600]   Here is the incarnation.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.440]   Here is the two natures in one person.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:33.760]   Here is the uniqueness of this son of God who knows and who knows what he's come to
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.520]   do, the bridegroom.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.720]   My friend, are you related to him?
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.520]   Is your life determined by him this evening?
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.240]   If not, you're not a Christian.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:49.060]   Is your happiness or your misery determined by your relationship to him?
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.780]   He says it must be if you're a Christian.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.320]   He controls everything.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:58.720]   Here, then, is the first and fundamental test.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.400]   What is our relationship to him?
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.120]   Is he everything to me?
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.480]   Is he my all in all?
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.920]   Is he alpha and omega?
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.080]   Do I say that I have nothing apart from him?
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:14.520]   Do I say that my salvation is in him, that Christianity is Christ, the bridegroom?
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.520]   If not, I say I'm not a Christian.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.240]   I'm stumbling as these people do.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:23.400]   But here, then, is the thing with which we must start.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:30.920]   The second point he makes is this, that the uniqueness and the staggering and surprising
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:38.320]   element in this teaching, in this salvation is that he makes it quite plain and clear
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:43.440]   to us that we become Christians and have our Christian joy.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.720]   Not at all as the result of our own activities.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:50.760]   See, that's what's amazed and shocked these people.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.880]   Look here, they said, your disciples are not fasting at all.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.720]   How can they be possibly religious?
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.000]   How can they be good?
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.360]   How can they please God?
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.520]   They're not fasting as they ought.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:08.920]   In other words, you see, what made you religious, according to these people, was your observance
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:14.040]   of the rules and regulations, your living of the good life.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.200]   They fasted often.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:21.720]   They'd been taught to fast frequently, and they thought the more regularly you observed
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:26.920]   your fast days, the better you were, the nearer to God and the more pleasing to God.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:32.520]   Fasting is something that you do yourself, and you make yourself a Christian by observing
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.840]   the rights and the rules and the regulations of the church.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.440]   There are thousands of people like that in the church tonight.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:42.980]   They verily believe that what makes them Christian is this, that they get up early in the morning
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:45.680]   to go to early morning fasting communion.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.620]   That's the thing.
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.240]   If you don't do that, you're a poor Christian.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.960]   But if you do that, then you must be a real Christian.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:43:00.280]   And they observe Lent and days and times and seasons, and are governed by rules and regulations.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.600]   And as you observe them, you're making yourself a Christian.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.240]   That was the attitude.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:12.760]   And to such people, the teaching of our blessed Lord and Savior was nothing but shocking and
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.960]   staggering.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.720]   It seemed to be terribly wrong, and they rebuke him for it.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:26.400]   But you see, he answers by saying, he says, that's not Christianity at all.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:34.240]   He says, what makes a man a Christian is not that he's been fasting and sweating and praying
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.800]   and doing good and trying thus to make himself a Christian.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:43.040]   No, no, he says, what makes a man a Christian is that he's received an invitation to a wedding
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.040]   breakfast.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   He's done nothing.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.360]   He just gets an invitation.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.800]   Come to the bridal feast.
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.880]   It's just his relationship to the bridegroom, that he's a friend of the bridegroom.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:02.000]   And here's the great occasion, and the bridegroom has invited him, and he's gone to the feast.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.440]   That's Christianity, he says.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.140]   Now, it's not surprising that these people were shocked, is it?
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.320]   When you've spent the whole of your lifetime thinking that you make yourself a Christian
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.160]   because you're a good man and by your good living and by your fasting and observance
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:18.720]   of rules and regulations, and are suddenly told, oh, that's quite irrelevant, doesn't
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.560]   matter at all.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:28.960]   You just receive the invitation and accept it, and you're in, you're in the feast, you're
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:29.960]   a Christian.
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:35.560]   Now, do you see why I read to you that third chapter of Paul's epistle to the Philippians
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.480]   at the beginning?
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:43.080]   That's exactly the thing that staggered him and shocked him and threw him on his back
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:50.760]   on the road to Damascus, this Hebrew of the Hebrews, of the stock of Benjamin, this authority
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:57.280]   on the law, this expert in all the minutiae and the details of religion and religiosity,
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:02.360]   this Pharisee of the Pharisees, this man who excelled everybody in his zeal for God, as
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:07.360]   he thought, and persecuting the Christian church, and who relied upon his goodness,
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:15.160]   his righteousness that he'd thus amassed, to put him right with God.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:25.800]   And suddenly he is told that it's all done, no better than a manure heap, what a shock.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:33.760]   And that you become a Christian by just saying, "Who art thou, Lord, and what wilt thou have
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:37.400]   me to do?" and no more.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:42.920]   Now I say that that's the most staggering, shocking thing a man can ever hear.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:49.040]   But that's Christianity, not your fasting, not your goodness, not your protest, not your
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.320]   Christian ideas, your Christian views.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.000]   That's never made anybody a Christian.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   It never will.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   It's the greatest hindrance.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   It's the cheapest obstacle.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   What is it?
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.640]   Well, here it is.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:15.940]   It's the free grace of God, the gift of God, the invitation of God, to come, to feast,
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:16.940]   to enjoy.
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.900]   There's the second thing.
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.980]   It starts with him, the bridegroom comes above everything.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:26.140]   Then you see that second step, nothing that we do.
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:36.080]   And then lastly, it's greatest, it's cheapest characteristic is it's John, "Can the children
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:41.640]   of the bride chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with him?"
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:45.720]   He said, "Are you surprised that these fellows of mine are so happy?
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.720]   Why are you surprised at that?
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:52.640]   Why are you so shocked that my disciples don't go about the world with long faces, always
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.280]   fasting and sweating and looking miserable and unhappy?
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.640]   Why are you shocked at that?
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.280]   What's the matter with you?"
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.360]   He says, "Your whole conception is wrong."
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:08.920]   He says, "We're in a wedding feast.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:09.920]   You haven't got this."
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:15.880]   The cheapest characteristic, he says, of my way and of my salvation is John.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.480]   But people are always amazed at that.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.480]   Why?
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.400]   Well, you see, we've always thought, haven't we, we've all done this, we're all like these
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.480]   disciples of John by nature.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:28.680]   We've always thought that religion is that which makes a man unhappy.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.680]   What is religion?
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.800]   Oh, I'll tell you what religion is.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:35.640]   Religion is that which tells you not to do various things.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:40.080]   Religion is that which always tells you to deny yourself, to give up things, to stop
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:44.040]   doing things you like and to start doing things you don't like.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.040]   What's religion?
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:55.960]   It means living, it means scorning delights and living laborious days.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.960]   Religion makes a man miserable.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:58.960]   Why?
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:04.080]   Well, because it means you're always striving, you're always straining, and yet you're always
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.480]   a failure.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:10.400]   It means you're filled with doubts, filled with lack of understanding.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.400]   You've got vague hopes and then your fears come and drown your hopes.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.400]   That's religion.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:21.520]   A man trying to make himself a Christian and trying to be right with God, his religion
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:26.680]   is a break upon his life, stands between him and all he wants.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:33.000]   That's how people think of religion.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.160]   People you see who are normally full of laughter and smiles and joy, they put on, as it were,
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.920]   a fresh face and go to church on Sunday morning.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.040]   Then they forget it as soon as they can and go to the sherry party and all is happy and
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.040]   well again.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.680]   But you see, there was that interlude at the hour while they were in the church, desperately
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.120]   serious, and it's a great effort sometimes.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:57.000]   But that's religion, this very serious thing that says no for the time being and then you
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.200]   forget it and you let yourself go.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.200]   That's the idea.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.520]   Morality, of course, is exactly the same.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:10.880]   A moral man may be a very good man but you've never met a joyous man who's just a moralist.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:11.880]   He can't be.
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:12.880]   It's impossible.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:18.440]   The standard is so high, he's so aware of his failures and of his own weakness.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:23.800]   Religion as such can't give joy, morality can't give joy, but here is something that
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:24.800]   gives joy.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:25.800]   Why?
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:31.320]   Well, he says it's coming to a banquet, it's coming to a great wedding breakfast, it's
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.720]   coming to a great feast.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.960]   Well, why should there be joy about it?
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.960]   Well, for this reason.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.720]   As I say, you've done nothing at all.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:42.600]   You haven't paid for a ticket, you haven't had to pay a great price, you get an invitation
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:47.160]   from your friend, "Come to my marriage feast, come for nothing!"
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:52.280]   And all you've got to do is to turn up and go into the feast.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:57.280]   That's why he talks about the joy of these people in the presence of the bridegroom.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.560]   Why is Christianity a religion of joy?
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:06.040]   Well, because, as I've already said, it is the free gift of God's grace.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:11.120]   It doesn't ask us to give anything, to make any contribution, it gives it all.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.880]   We are simply invited and we sit down and we begin to partake.
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.400]   Why is this a religion of joy?
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.520]   Well, he answers the question.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:21.320]   The presence of the bridegroom.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.480]   He's such a person, you can't possibly be miserable in his presence.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:31.440]   His very appearance, his whole demeanor, everything he's got to say, his character, his kindness.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.700]   Who can be miserable in the presence of such a person, the bridegroom?
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.760]   Have you ever come near him, my friend?
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:43.080]   If ever you've come near the Lord Jesus Christ, you'll know something of this joy.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.600]   You can't be mournful in his presence.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:51.160]   You must praise him, the glory, the wonder of his person.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:56.800]   And then when you begin to think of what he's done for us, how he left the courts of heaven
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:02.560]   and humbled himself and became a man for us, that we might be delivered out of the misery
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:06.280]   of sin and its shame and all its confusion.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:11.440]   He came and not only lived and taught, but he died, that we might have this.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.440]   Think of what he's done.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.280]   Can you still be sad and unhappy?
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:18.680]   Are you still thinking of yourself and your own efforts and your fasting?
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.680]   No, no.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.440]   This is wonderful good news.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:27.720]   And then think of what he gives you so freely.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:33.800]   What he places before you when you come to the feast and accept his invitation, free
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.400]   pardon of all your sins.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:41.280]   Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:45.000]   Though you've sinned until the moment you entered this building and have lived an evil
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.520]   life, it doesn't matter, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, thou shalt be saved.
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.400]   Your sins are blotted out now.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.920]   You don't have to wait and propose this or that.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:58.840]   Believe on him and you're forgiven now, here and now, without anything.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:51:59.840]   Just as you are.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.840]   That's what he gives you.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.600]   Do you feel like mourning?
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.680]   Is this a time for putting on sackcloth and ashes?
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.680]   Aren't you on your feet shouting?
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.600]   He's offering it to you for nothing.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:14.480]   Because he's died, he offers you free pardon and forgiveness.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.480]   What else?
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:21.800]   A new life, a new beginning, a new start.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.040]   He's invited you to the feast.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.040]   You come.
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.040]   You say, "I'm in rags.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.040]   I'm unworthy."
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.040]   It's all right, he says.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.040]   Put the robe on you.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.640]   He'll clothe you with his own righteousness.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:36.040]   And you can sit down with the saints without feeling ashamed at the royal banquet of the
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:41.680]   Son of God, the bridegroom, the husband of the church and his people.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:47.240]   And he'll fill you with a new power that you've never understood before and never experienced
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.240]   before.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.720]   Oh, let me end by putting it like this.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.280]   This is his description.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:58.480]   You become the friends of the bridegroom, a friend of the Son of God.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.480]   Yea, more.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.240]   You become his brother.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.560]   He's the firstborn amongst many brethren.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.240]   You become a child of God.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.860]   You become adopted into the family of God.
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:13.220]   You become a member of the household of God.
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:17.280]   You become an heir of God and a joint heir with Christ.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.280]   Here's Christianity.
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.280]   What?
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:23.360]   You said, you mean to say that a man who may have come in off the street tonight who's
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:29.320]   never thought about Christ or God or his soul or Christianity ever in his life, you mean
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:34.080]   to say he can come in and begin to enjoy that now with a man who's thriven throughout the
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.760]   long life that he's lived?
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:39.920]   That's precisely what it is.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:44.840]   And if you're not amazed at it, you don't see it.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:48.080]   No man ever thought it was like this.
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:51.280]   It's utterly opposed to all we've ever thought.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:56.680]   It's utterly opposed to all religions and all moralities and philosophies.
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:04.560]   It is unique and it's amazing and surprising, but oh, the glory of it all.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:08.680]   And oh, the joy that it should lead to.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.440]   My dear friend, are you rejoicing in Christ Jesus?
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:14.880]   Did you hear Paul addressing those Philippians?
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.000]   Rejoice in the Lord always, he says.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.520]   And again I say, rejoice.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.800]   Again he repeats it.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:21.800]   Rejoice evermore.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.600]   Go on rejoicing.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.780]   What else can you do?
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:31.240]   My dear friend, do you realize that the Son of God loved you and died for you, came from
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.840]   heaven to earth to deliver you?
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.080]   Do you believe that?
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.080]   Do you know your sins are forgiven?
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:41.040]   Well, I say, if you do, you must be filled with rejoicing in the presence of the bridegroom
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:48.180]   and all that he has to give you.
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:51.460]   That's Christianity.
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:56.840]   That's the message of salvation and none other.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:03.840]   And the test of it is, I say, whether we believe it or not, whether we know this blessed joy.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:10.040]   Did you agree with those words of Robert Robinson that we sang just now?
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:19.160]   But thy rich, thy free redemption, dark through brightness all along, thought is poor and
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:27.240]   poor expression, who dare sing the wondrous song?
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:36.080]   Grace of the Father's glory, shall thy praise unuttered lie?
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:47.360]   Break, my soul, such guilty silence, sing the Lord who came to die.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:59.720]   Praise my soul, the King of heaven, to his feet thy tribute bring, ransomed, healed,
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:11.680]   restored, forgiven, who like thee his praise should sing, praise him, praise him, praise
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:24.360]   the everlasting, all that I could, forever sit like Mary at the master's feet.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:39.320]   Be this, my chiefest joy, my hope, my fear, my delight, be this, forever at the master's
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:48.440]   feet to sit, to hear the bright groom's voice.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.840]   Have you ever heard it?
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:58.560]   Do you know something of a joy unspeakable and full of glory?
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:04.280]   My dear friends, I ask you the question in the midst of the solemnity of these tremendous
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:11.120]   days in which we are living, which is our idea of this?
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.800]   Is it that of the disciples of John?
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:15.840]   Is your religion against the grain?
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.440]   Is it something you have to force yourself to?
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:19.600]   Is it a task?
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:23.520]   Is it something that you're engaged in simply because you're afraid of hell?
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:29.120]   Or do you know the bridegroom?
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:32.000]   Have you heard his voice?
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.720]   Are you a friend of him?
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:39.800]   Do you realize that it's entirely of his grace and love and goodness that he's invited you
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.360]   into the feast?
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:45.440]   Have you heard the invitation?
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.000]   Have you accepted it?
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.860]   And are you rejoicing in Christ Jesus?
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:58:03.540]   God forbid that we should stumble and be upset and annoyed at the central, the chiefest glory
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:14.180]   of this great and glorious salvation.
[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:18.100]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
