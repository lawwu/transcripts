[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Here's a question that is not rare,
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.540]   although because it's a little bizarre,
[00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.500]   it may strike us as a little weird at first,
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.940]   but it's sincere and important,
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.140]   and it's not infrequent in our inbox.
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.340]   This time it comes from a listener named Leslie.
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.180]   Pastor John, I'm not trying to derive personal comfort
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.520]   from this question, I just honestly wanna know,
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.760]   can people who are in heaven look down
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.460]   and see us, their loved ones, on earth?
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.120]   - Well, who of us would not like to know?
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.500]   - Right, exactly.
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.500]   Who has not asked this good question and wanted to know,
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.000]   especially those of us who've lost loved ones
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.940]   and think about it personally that way,
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.800]   as well as those who wonder whether
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.380]   Jonathan Edwards is looking down or the Apostle Paul.
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.420]   So let me say five things in response to this question.
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.720]   Number one, ultimately, I think the answer is
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.060]   we don't know for sure.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.620]   At least we don't know to what extent
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.060]   they might be allowed to see and know
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.600]   all that goes on on earth.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.360]   There's at least one passage of scripture
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.160]   that some writers would interpret in a way
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.100]   that makes it quite clear that they do know what's going on,
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.340]   and I'll get to that in just a moment.
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.680]   But I think I would not stake my life
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.780]   on a position on this because I don't know for sure.
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.920]   But I'll tell you what I think in just a minute.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.920]   Number two, I would say that if God grants saints in heaven
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.660]   to see the suffering and misery,
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.800]   as well as the good on the earth,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.400]   we may be sure that they see it,
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.500]   not with their old imperfect eyes,
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.880]   and they understand it not with their old imperfect minds,
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.880]   and they assess it not with their old imperfect hearts.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.680]   Rather, we may be sure, because the Bible says
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.460]   that they have been perfected in heaven, Hebrews 12, 23,
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.920]   that they will see and understand and assess all things
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.300]   in a perfectly spiritual way that takes into account
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.040]   everything they need to know in order to make sense of it
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.780]   and to keep from making any mistakes.
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.340]   And so they will not in the least doubt the goodness of God
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.840]   in what they see or the wisdom of God in what they see.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.280]   That may be as important as any surety
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.480]   of whether they can come and see.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.020]   Third, there is one text that may well,
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.060]   I think probably does, probably does suggest
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.140]   that God grants the saints in heaven to witness the race
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.100]   that we are running on earth, Hebrews 12, 1.
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.780]   Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.780]   of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and sin
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.880]   which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.760]   the race that is set before us.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.660]   Now, the reason that doesn't settle things for me completely
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.660]   like it does Henry Alford, he thinks that just closes
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.300]   the deal, he thinks they definitely see us, watch us,
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.940]   cheer for us, but the reason that doesn't settle things
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.340]   completely for me is that the Greek word witness here,
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.580]   just a couple of verses earlier and three times at least
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.580]   in chapter 11 is a word used to refer to the testimony
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.520]   that the saints of old gave in their willingness to die
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.280]   for the truth of God.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.020]   So it's possible that Hebrews 12, 1,
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.860]   surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses simply means
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.100]   that all the saints in the past, when they died,
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.800]   successfully witnessed to their faith on earth
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.400]   and made it to heaven through their suffering
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.940]   so you can make it too, not that they're watching you.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.380]   But I'm inclined to think it does mean that they're watching
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.360]   partly because of the picture of the race.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.920]   And it's as though the saints finished their marathon
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.460]   at their deaths, then they come around and stand
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.460]   on the side of the racetrack and watch us.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.500]   And we are supposed to take heart from that
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.100]   because in essence, they would be saying,
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.700]   "Hang in there, trust God, you can do this.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.580]   "We made it, you can make it too."
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.840]   And I find that very, very encouraging.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.860]   And the fourth thing I would say is that we should be
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.420]   more cautioned to beware of spending too much time
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.360]   thinking about the saints above so that we're tempted
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.300]   to interact with them in the way that the Roman Catholics do
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.100]   when they pray to the saints and pray to Mary.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.680]   I think this is very dangerous for the health of our faith.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.600]   It has led many people, millions I fear,
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.580]   to look to the saints and to Mary in their longing for help
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.620]   rather than focusing on Christ and the throne of grace
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.880]   that he has opened to us.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.880]   This very book of Hebrews that we just quoted
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.560]   also says in chapter 415,
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.520]   "We do not have a high priest who's unable to sympathize
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.800]   "with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.600]   "has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.500]   "Let us with confidence then," because of Christ,
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.900]   because of Christ, "Let us with confidence then
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.440]   "draw near to the throne of grace."
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.140]   Not to Mary, not to the saints.
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.840]   "Let us draw near to the throne of grace
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.180]   "that we may receive mercy and find grace to help
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.420]   "in time of need."
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.420]   Christ is the one mediator between God and man.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.460]   And the New Testament does not encourage us
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.760]   to make the saints or Mary into mediators
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.420]   as we seek God's help.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.560]   And the last thing I would say
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.440]   is a caution against sentimentalism.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.700]   You know, if you watch movies or television,
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.580]   sooner or later, it seems, every show that has somebody die
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.980]   is gonna have some sentimental, sappy statement about,
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.240]   well, they're with the angels or they're in heaven
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.780]   or they're looking down on us, et cetera,
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.380]   without any reference to God or Christ.
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.380]   And we're all tempted to hope that those who had no faith
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.560]   as far as we could see or little faith,
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.520]   we hope they might be saved.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.560]   And of course, Jesus is merciful
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.240]   and the thief on the cross was saved in his 11th hour.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.100]   And we're not the last judge.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.640]   Maybe God turned somebody's heart just before they died.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.640]   We don't make those judgments, but Jesus warns us.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.880]   "On that day, many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord,
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.120]   "'did we not prophesy in your name,
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.720]   "'cast out demons in your name,
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.280]   "'do many mighty works in your name?'
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.680]   "And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.400]   "'Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.560]   "And that's a warning, not just for ourselves,
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.500]   "lest we deceive ourselves into thinking
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.100]   "we're following Christ when we're not.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.100]   "It's also a warning that we not be sentimental
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.480]   "as though everybody who was a good person who died
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.640]   "is going to be in heaven.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.140]   "So the bottom line is that we should focus
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.280]   "on the great central realities of the New Testament,
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.660]   "which are rock solid, absolutely certain,
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.560]   "full of hope for all who trust in Christ.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.420]   "And if you think about the great saints in heaven,
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:43.300]   "take heart, if they see you at all,
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.300]   "they are cheering you on to endure every hardship
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.340]   "by encouraging you to focus on Christ."
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.740]   - Amen, what a motivation.
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.220]   That's a great balance of text, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.380]   And a very interesting twist on Hebrews 11 too.
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.620]   I was not expecting that.
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.980]   Leslie, thank you for your question.
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.680]   And thanks to everyone who listens in to this podcast.

[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.160]   We are gonna take a break for the weekend.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.740]   Now on Monday, we're gonna return
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.800]   and talk about heaven again,
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.600]   and whether some people will have more joy in heaven
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.900]   than other people will have.
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.340]   Some things Pastor John has said in the recent past,
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.940]   and some things that Jonathan Edwards said
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.940]   in the distant past, leads one listener to conclude
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.120]   that yes, some people will have more joy
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.920]   or less joy in heaven.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.620]   We'll get to the bottom of that question
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.720]   using biblical texts on Monday.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.820]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.120]   Have a great weekend, and we'll see you on Monday.
