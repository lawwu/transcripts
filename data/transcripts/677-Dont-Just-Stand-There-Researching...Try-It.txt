[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:11.780]  , the first story has to do with investments.
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.800]   The first story has to do with investments.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.900]   The first story has to do with investments. Specifically, investments in things that many of us have never particularly experienced, such as investing in gold.

[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:34.980]   There are people on one side who say, "Nobody should ever buy gold. It's a worthless, useless metal. Nonproductive."
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:43.980]   And then on the other hand, there are people who say, "Everybody should put everything in gold. After all, it's the only thing that will stand when the world goes crazy and everything else goes to zero."
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:52.080]   So, as you would imagine, people have questions on this, and they want to make good decisions.
