[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.560]   Today I'd like to talk with you about the value of just do it.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.320]   Just try it.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.640]   Just test it.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.360]   I want to share with you two stories to drive home to you a very simple point.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.080]   The first story has to do with investments, specifically investments in things that many
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.960]   of us have never particularly experienced, such as investing in gold.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:22.380]   I was recently answering a question that somebody asked about the prospect of investing in gold.
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.240]   Now gold is one of the most hotly debated topics in the world of investing.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.880]   There are people on one side who say nobody should ever buy gold.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.000]   It's a worthless, useless metal.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It's nonproductive.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.840]   And then on the other hand, there are people who say everybody should put everything in
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.840]   gold.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.040]   After all, it's the only thing that will stand when the world goes crazy and everything else
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.560]   goes to zero.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.760]   So as you would imagine, people have questions on this and they want to make good decisions.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.840]   And so when you go with a question like this and you ask for advice, the problem is you're
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.820]   simply going to receive advice from a number of different people who are operating from
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.440]   a number of different perspectives.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.240]   Now years ago, I did not own any gold.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:19.120]   I had never invested in gold and being a student of mainstream investing philosophy, I was
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.160]   under the, I was of the opinion that gold was basically a worthless investment.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.520]   After all, it's unproductive and it doesn't really have any use.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.200]   And I was completely convinced that gold, nobody should own gold.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.960]   That was the advice that I used to give to people when they would ask me this question.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.560]   Then in time, I started thinking more deeply about the issues and the questions and I started
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.160]   researching the topic of investing in gold.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.880]   And I came to believe that there were other valid positions other than the one that I
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.880]   had.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.880]   I wasn't sure I was wrong, but I wasn't sure anymore that I was right.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.360]   And I didn't really know what to do.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.440]   And somebody gave me this advice.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.920]   They said, just go and buy a gold coin.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.800]   And I decided, you know what, I'm just going to go and buy a gold coin.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.400]   I'm going to see what this is like.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:22.560]   Now there've been very few times in my life where I have felt dirty when doing something,
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.000]   but this was genuinely one of those times.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.880]   I went and looked and found the information for a local coin shop right in my town.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.880]   And then I drove to the coin shop and I had my cash in my pocket.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.040]   Didn't really know what I was doing.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.320]   And I went to the front door and I was, of course, a little bit weirded out by the double
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.200]   doors that coin shops always have.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.760]   And I went in and I remember I felt like I was buying drugs.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.520]   I felt like I was doing something illegal.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.520]   It was so weird for me.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.920]   I felt like I was abandoning the investment faith that had been handed down through the
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.360]   ages, that nobody should buy gold.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.280]   But I was convinced that I wanted to buy a gold coin and see what it was like.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.000]   And so finally the representative of the coin shop finished with their other customer and
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   they were ready for me.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.520]   And I said, "Link, I'd like to buy a gold coin, but I don't really know what to buy."
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.480]   And I started talking with them.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.320]   And then I started asking questions about what to buy.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:28.440]   And long story short, I walked out 30 minutes later with a gold coin in my pocket and more
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.560]   importantly, an education.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.240]   Now in my case, I still remember, I still have the coin that I bought.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.840]   I bought a one-tenth ounce gold American Eagle.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.080]   It was probably a couple hundred bucks at the time, but that was it.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.080]   It was a couple hundred bucks.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.320]   And I had this little gold coin.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.400]   And as I went home with this little gold coin, just looking at it, I had a very different
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.080]   understanding of what it was like to invest in gold than I had a couple hours earlier.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.200]   I had asked lots of questions of the coin dealer.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.360]   I started to understand a little bit about the bid and the ask, which is the way that
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.760]   gold coins are dealt with.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:13.240]   And then I started to have a different appreciation for the gold coin than I had before owning
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.520]   it.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.560]   Now I'm not going to go any farther on the gold discussion at the moment.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.480]   I just want you to understand the lesson, which is if you can go and simply try something
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:35.760]   for yourself with minimal cost and minimal risk, you're probably better served to just
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:45.880]   go do it and try it than you are to spend hours and hours and hours researching it.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.440]   Now I've long been a fan of the aphorism of you should take as much time researching an
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.760]   investment as it takes you to earn the money that you put into it.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.760]   I like that.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:02.280]   I don't think it's actually practical to do in all circumstances, but what I like about
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.320]   that little nugget is it gets your mind moving in the right direction.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.640]   When you're going to make a big investment, make sure that you understand that investment
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.440]   through and through and make sure that you have exhaustively researched the potential
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.500]   benefits and potential drawbacks of that investment.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.520]   On the other hand, if you're going to make a small investment, I would say don't spend
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.400]   all that much time.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.880]   Just go try it.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.220]   Just go do it.
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.160]   Now in my case, buying the gold coin was a total risk of what, a couple hundred dollars?
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.160]   What was the risk?
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.960]   Well, the risk was that I was going to have to walk back into the coin shop the next day
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.700]   and sell the gold coin back to the coin dealer.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.040]   Maybe the gold market went down a little bit, the spot price declined in one day, and I
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.600]   had to pay the difference between the bid and the ask.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.280]   Whatever, big deal.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.000]   So I lose 50 bucks, big deal.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.980]   What I actually gained from simply taking action instead of talking about it was a wealth
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.880]   of experience.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.640]   A wealth of experience.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.000]   Now in that case, the risk was relatively small.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Story number two, I have just returned from a week and a half of traveling.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.240]   And let me tell you, I'm tired of traveling.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.400]   When I was younger, I used to think, "I just want to travel all the time.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.400]   I want to travel.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.880]   I want to travel."
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.840]   Well, I think I probably like traveling about as much as anybody.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:42.280]   But in a whole lot of traveling over the years, I've come to view traveling in a more objective
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.640]   light.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:49.440]   And I'm grateful for that because I no longer put travel at the very top of my list.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.660]   And I think a lot of people who dream about the day when they retire just so they can
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.540]   go and travel, they have that there, not because it's something that they actually want or
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.600]   are actually pursuing, but just because it's an idea that seems nice to them, that seems
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.560]   like something they want to do.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.120]   I vividly remember the first time I took a business trip, a traveling business trip.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.920]   I was so excited.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.960]   I was working for a company at the time, and I had to travel from Florida to California
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.720]   and I had to do all the big boy things.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.000]   I had to order a car.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.520]   I ordered a black limousine car, not a big stretch, but just I ordered a Lincoln Town
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.680]   Car Service to pick me up.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.360]   And I flew out there by myself.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.240]   I had a hotel room and everything, and then I flew back home.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.740]   And I thought, "Huh, that wasn't nearly as fun as I thought it was going to be."
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.240]   But then times have gone on, and over the years I've done a whole lot of adventure travel,
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.000]   a lot of times on the cheap.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.240]   And each time I've learned something, and a lot of times I've come back saying, "Huh,
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.080]   that really wasn't as fun as I thought it was going to be."
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.880]   Now, I still like traveling, but I've come to learn that I like certain styles of traveling,
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.000]   certain types of traveling.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.720]   I don't know how much money I've spent over the years on travel, but all things considered,
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.880]   probably not that much.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.800]   More recently, since I buy many plane tickets at a time instead of one, but not that much.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   What I've realized is I like a little bit of travel, but I don't like constant travel.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.520]   That's not for me.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.620]   And so what it means is that if I'm imagining forward in my life, and I'm trying to lay
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:32.700]   out what's my perfect lifestyle, I don't have to budget in years and years of travel into
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.780]   my early retirement plans.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:41.920]   I can just budget in a little bit of travel here and there, and I can be content.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.840]   And so by spending a little bit of money now, I've gained valuable experience that will
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.440]   help me to spend less money down the road.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.320]   I've learned by experience.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.880]   Now, I personally think there are probably different personality types.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.240]   Some people need to learn by experience, some people don't.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.200]   And I think I'm probably one of those, and I don't really believe what people tell me
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.840]   until I've tried it out for myself.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.320]   I'm a person that likes to gain experiences.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.360]   So if you have a different personality type, that's fine.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.840]   But I would encourage you, if you're the kind of person who's sitting back and just researching,
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.520]   researching, researching, cut it off and just try it.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.280]   Don't ask more questions about what do I do if this, what happens if, what do I do if
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.280]   that?
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.280]   Just go and do it.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.800]   Cover your downside, protect yourself, understand a little bit of what the risks are.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.640]   But if you can try something inexpensively, try it.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.920]   If you've always wanted to get a job in a certain industry, just go get a job.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.120]   If you wanted to move to another town, move.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.520]   If you wanted to buy a certain thing or invest in a certain thing, you wanted to buy some
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.320]   gold or buy a mutual fund or buy Bitcoin, just do it.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:11:00.680]   And you'll learn so much more by doing it than you will by reading about it.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:07.560]   Spend time thinking carefully about big questions and big issues.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.760]   But if you can try something inexpensively, do it.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.520]   And by the way, when it comes to the big issues, a lot of times one of the best things you
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.760]   can do is still apply the same principle.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:27.160]   Before you go and open a restaurant, make sure you've at least worked in a restaurant.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.800]   Before you go and spend millions of your dollars becoming a property developer, make sure you've
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.680]   at least spent some time with somebody and volunteered for somebody who does property
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.520]   development.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.660]   Be a doer and you'll get better data to make better decisions.
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:51.000]   And as your good decisions compound over time, you'll get much better results.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
