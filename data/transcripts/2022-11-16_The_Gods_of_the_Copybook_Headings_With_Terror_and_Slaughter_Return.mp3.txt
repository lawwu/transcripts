[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   If you are looking for an exciting role in customer service, food service, or retail,
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.520]   connect with a job at the airport.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.560]   Get started in a role that offers competitive wages, consistent schedules, and fast-tracked
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.100]   management while you work in a vibrant, exciting environment where security is a priority.
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.820]   The airport has it all.
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.640]   You can have it all too.

[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.900]   As I pass through my incarnations, in every age and race, I make my proper prostrations
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.360]   to the gods of the marketplace.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.120]   Peering through reverent fingers, I watch them flourish and fall.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.280]   And the gods of the copybook headings, I notice, outlast them all.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.840]   We were living in trees when they met us.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.400]   They showed us each in turn that water would certainly wet us, as fire would certainly
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.680]   burn.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.640]   But we found them lacking in uplift, vision, and breadth of mind.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.720]   So we left them to teach the gorillas, while we followed the march of mankind.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720]   We moved as the spirit listed.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.520]   They never altered their pace, being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the gods of the
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.260]   marketplace.
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.520]   But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come that a tribe
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.820]   had been wiped off its ice field, or the lights had gone out in Rome.
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.920]   With the hopes that our world is built on, they were utterly out of touch.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.300]   They denied that the moon was Stilton.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.440]   They denied she was even Dutch.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.760]   They denied that wishes were horses.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.360]   They denied that a pig had wings.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.120]   So we worshipped the gods of the market, who promised these beautiful things.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.640]   When the Cambrian measures were forming, they promised perpetual peace.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.040]   They swore if we gave them our weapons that the wars of the tribes would cease.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.880]   But when we disarmed, they sold us and delivered us bound to our foe.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.120]   And the gods of the copybook headings said, "Stick to the devil you know."
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.680]   On the first Feminian sandstones we were promised the fuller life, which started by loving our
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.640]   neighbor and ended by loving his wife.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.080]   Till our women had no more children, and the men lost reason and faith.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.160]   And the gods of the copybook headings said, "The wages of sin is death."
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.080]   In the Carboniferous epoch we were promised abundance for all, by robbing selected Peter
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.920]   to pay for collective Paul.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.880]   But though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.720]   And the gods of the copybook headings said, "If you don't work, you die."
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.780]   Then the gods of the market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew.
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.560]   And the hearts of the meanest were humbled, and began to believe it was true, that all
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.440]   is not gold that glitters, and two and two make four.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.520]   And the gods of the copybook headings limped up to explain it once more.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.760]   As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of man, there are only four things certain
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.560]   since social progress began.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.520]   That the dog returns to his vomit, and the sow returns to her mire, and the burnt fool's
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.760]   bandaged finger goes wobbling back to the fire.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.120]   And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins, when all men are paid
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.820]   for existing, and no man must pay for his sins.
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.440]   As surely as water will wet us, as surely as fire will burn, the gods of the copybook
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.480]   headings with terror and slaughter return.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.820]   That poem is by Rudyard Kipling, it's titled "The Gods of the Copybook Headings," and it's
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.960]   one of my two favorite Kipling poems.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:08.500]   My other favorite is the classic Kipling poem "If," but this is my second favorite.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.900]   And I've thought about this a lot over the last week or two.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.180]   This last month in October we read Kipling poems every day at our breakfast table, among
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.660]   other assorted readings we read a poem together.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.900]   And this last month we were reading Kipling, and I was reminded of this classic excellent
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.900]   poem.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.780]   I've been reading it for a few years, when reading it to my family, and it's just been
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.420]   burning in my mind ever since I read it, as I've watched events happen in the world.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.780]   Let me give you a quick bit of analysis to help the uninitiated to understand and perhaps
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.940]   appreciate this poem on a deeper level.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.540]   Rudyard Kipling wrote this poem, or at least it was published, in the year 1919, the end
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.260]   of the year in England, and then early the next year in the United States.
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:00.100]   If you think for a moment about what was happening in the world in 1919 and 1920, you'll quickly
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.180]   come to realize that World War I had officially come to a close.
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.500]   But what is very important to understand about World War I and its impact on the world is
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.220]   that World War I basically destroyed the progressivism of the era.
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.140]   A little bit of broad social commentary.
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:34.120]   Remember that the 19th century and the early 20th century was a time of high-flying ambition
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.420]   for most of the cultural elites in the West.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:45.540]   Coming out of the Renaissance, the Renaissance period, where people believed that all things
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:52.420]   were being reborn and rebirthed and that we were coming together to create the dream world
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.420]   that we wanted.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.940]   You look around the world, you see various revolutions in many places, revolutions in
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.260]   social thought, etc.
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:05.340]   A lot of those violent revolutions had died down in the 19th century, and the elites of
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.340]   the world, especially the elites of the West, were flying high, believing that we were in
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:18.660]   a brand new era where none of the old rules applied and we had the choice to remake everything
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:25.500]   exactly as we wanted to be, to basically remake the world in our image as the most enlightened,
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.980]   most informed human beings of all time.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:36.180]   This was a heady and euphoric era in the cultural elites.
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.300]   And yet an event happened that destroyed all of that.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.420]   That event is called World War I.
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:52.620]   World War I devastated, on really a global basis, the culture, because it proved that
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:07:01.980]   not only were the many predictions of eternal peace and prosperity, etc., certainly wrong.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.300]   Worse than that, World War I was so exceedingly destructive that it proved that on the flip
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.140]   side all of the worst things of the human experience were available to a much higher
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:20.780]   degree, and war could now be more destructive than ever before.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.300]   So in the wake of World War I, Rudyard Kipling wrote this poem called "The Gods of the Copybook
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.300]   Headings."
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.540]   Now, who are the gods of the copybook headings?
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.820]   What is a copybook heading?
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:36.660]   In those days, a century back, it was very common and normal that in order to learn and
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.460]   practice handwriting, you would be given a copybook.
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:46.500]   A copybook was a bound collection of pages with lines drawn on them, and at the top of
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:54.140]   the copybook would be a pithy aphorism or a proverb or some other maxim or verse.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.580]   It could be a verse of poetry, a verse of scripture, etc.
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.540]   And this was given to you to copy multiple times as a way of simultaneously perfecting
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:09.620]   your handwriting, but also as a way of drilling into your head the moral instruction that
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.580]   mattered.
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:16.260]   And this would have been very commonly understood at the time when he published the poem.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.300]   For example, he makes three specific quotes in this poem from the copybook headings.
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:26.060]   "Stick to the devil you know," "The wages of sin is death," and "If you don't work, you
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.060]   die."
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.740]   And of course there were many others.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.220]   But these gods of the copybook headings were part of the common culture.
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:39.660]   This is the classic wisdom of the centuries collected into a form that we could use to
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.900]   instruct our children.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:48.780]   And yet there was this... we wanted to disregard all of the gods of the copybook headings.
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.540]   We wanted to disregard these classic forms of wisdom, and we want to show that these
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.560]   things are out of touch.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.860]   We wanted to show that the gods of the market, the comparison here between the gods of the
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.460]   market is the ideas of the current day, showing that all the ideas of the past are out of
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.460]   touch.
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.220]   And this was a time of tremendous social change.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:14.380]   But of course, on virtually every level, as you see Kipling's analysis here, is social
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:21.740]   commentary showing that no, actually the wisdom of the ages is here to stay, and it's not
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.920]   changing.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.640]   It's the gods of the market who are foolish and deluded, and what's worse, they may be
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.200]   more than foolish and deluded.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.400]   They may genuinely be immoral.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:43.320]   They may genuinely be... they may not just be wrong, they may be worse than that.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:52.880]   Now the temptation for all of us is to assume that our situations... that we understand
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.440]   exactly what the flow of history is going to look like.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:01.800]   And yet throughout history, it's very difficult to see why you're in the middle of it.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.040]   And so I want to be cautious, because I of course have my own opinions and my own perspectives
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.480]   on the things that will work and the things that will not work in our day and age, ranging
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.600]   from financial topics, which is my primary focus here at Radical Personal Finance, to
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.680]   social topics and cultural topics, political topics, etc.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.240]   We all have our biases, our understanding and our perspectives.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:33.680]   And I would say that history will show us that things can change, and things often should
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.800]   change.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.560]   But there's also that classic maxim that we have, saying that the more things change,
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.600]   the more they stay the same.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.440]   That most of the things that we argue about, most of the changes, are actually... don't
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.960]   accomplish the things that we hope that they accomplish.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:58.400]   And even the changes that stick wind up with a whole long list of unintended consequences.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:06.880]   I think when you think about social issues or cultural issues, you can see this classic
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.340]   tension more than financial issues.
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:20.280]   But in financial issues, we have to grow increasingly confident with our perspectives.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.360]   And yet this is... meaning we have to make sure that we understand the wisdom of the
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:31.720]   past, and then use whatever useful frameworks we can find from the past in order to be clear
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.560]   and understanding of what is working today.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:43.080]   And yet this is difficult, because it flies in the face of what seems to be apparent today.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.400]   The change that we're particularly excited about today.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.440]   I was struck by, of course, the event of this past week, right?
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.540]   FTX, the collapse of FTX, the collapse of various cryptocurrencies, complete destruction
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:03.100]   across the marketplace in terms of stealing of customer money, many accounts disappeared,
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.900]   just massive levels of destruction, right?
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.900]   We've talked about that elsewhere.
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:13.940]   But I was thinking about this when comparing a little meme that I saw showing the collapse
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:23.300]   of the net worth of Mr. Facebook, Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg compared to Warren Buffett's
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.420]   net worth over the past months.
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:33.800]   And Warren Buffett is basically this archetype of the classic traditional investor, right?
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.580]   This is Warren Buffett who owns Nebraska Furniture Mart, and who owns railroads, and who invests
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.580]   in these long companies.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.700]   And this is the Warren Buffett who said, "I don't invest in tech because I don't understand
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.700]   it."
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:52.340]   Now, always remember with Warren Buffett that a lot of his folksiness is more of an image
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:58.700]   that he has cultivated rather than a genuine expression of who he is.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:04.820]   If you read a biography of Warren Buffett, you'll quickly see that he is exceedingly
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:14.180]   smart, he is exceedingly current, he is extremely progressive, but he has cultivated over the
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:20.220]   years this impression of kind of the folksy grandfather from Omaha.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.580]   So don't be fooled by the image that he has cultivated.
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:34.660]   But there is also a sense in which we see a tremendous truthfulness behind kind of the
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.860]   tried and true.
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:44.940]   If we look at, for example, Buffett, his investing philosophy goes back to Benjamin Graham and
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:52.340]   the writers of a century back, and the philosophies of a century back.
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:58.580]   And in that context, we can see that you can still use the tools and tactics and techniques
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:04.300]   of the past century very, very effectively in our modern age.
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:11.420]   I myself find myself drawn consistently to the concept of value investing because it
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:17.540]   aligns with this idea that there is value, here's how we arrive at the value, we buy
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:25.940]   when the markets are inexpensive and we keep for a very long time and sell when they're
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:26.940]   overvalued.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:39.300]   The problem is this requires you to go against what is often years of seeming wrongness.
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.180]   And I want to bring our attention to this in the wake of the cryptocurrency markets
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.940]   over the past few years.
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:52.580]   There was a time, feels like a year ago, maybe about a year ago, when I looked around and
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:57.580]   I wondered, are all of the rules of finance completely broken?
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:03.460]   I looked around and I looked at the rates that people were earning on various schemes
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.180]   in cryptocurrency, the rates of return, etc.
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.580]   And I thought, what's wrong with me?
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.020]   Why do I not see that this stuff could work?
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.740]   But I didn't come out and just completely oppose it all as scams because I don't think
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.180]   it all is.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.820]   But it was very evident, especially in hindsight, and again, I'm fully aware that it can be
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:27.020]   easy to talk about, oh, look, I was so smart after the fact.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:31.580]   But it was evident that, wait a second, this can't continue because the numbers just don't
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.900]   make sense.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:39.740]   So always remember that markets can be very irrational for a significant period of time.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:45.060]   And those may be interesting and fun times to speculate, but you always want to make
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:55.740]   sure that you go back to what has always worked, the traditional things that are proven, because
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:02.380]   the irrationality of today will eventually be corrected by the gods of the copybook headings,
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:12.100]   that true wisdom that has been collected from our forebears.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.340]   My first argument is simply that you should accept that.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:20.020]   You should accept that there is wisdom in the past.
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.620]   If I were starting Radical Personal Finance over again, I'm not sure I would choose the
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.980]   name Radical Personal Finance.
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:26.980]   I still like it.
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.500]   I'm going with it because I believe it expresses some very useful truths.
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.500]   But over the years, over the last almost 10 years that I've done this podcast, I have
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.740]   come to appreciate how...
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:46.620]   I have come to appreciate the wisdom of the past on so many issues.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:52.540]   And I've come to realize that this is more to simply a reflection of my age, and what
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.660]   a man learns as he grows older.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.640]   When I started with the name Radical Personal Finance, I was frustrated by the world as
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.220]   it was, and I wanted to change it in a very progressive shape.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:08.060]   And so I had many ideas about how everything should be different from the past, and I wasn't
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.700]   paying attention to the wisdom of the ages the way that I should have.
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:18.860]   And what I found very interesting and ironic is that as I have tested many ongoing radical
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:26.100]   ideas, I have frequently found that there was a wisdom in the traditional conservative
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.840]   culture of the day that I didn't appreciate.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.100]   And I've come to believe that I should be very slow about just simply throwing out the
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:42.460]   old system and wiping my hands of it and just saying, "Oh, it's all worthless."
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:47.820]   I think any long-time listeners would notice that I have tried to become much more cautious
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:54.540]   in my commentary and be more accurate, rather than being flippant and revolutionary in my
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:18:01.700]   comments, to be accurate and thoughtful and acknowledge what has gone well, and acknowledge
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:13.540]   that I may not understand until many years from now why a certain structure exists.
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:22.380]   And that if we replace something we don't understand, we often reap consequences that
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.460]   we didn't anticipate.
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.700]   And unfortunately I see this happening very broadly.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:36.260]   I'll give you an example from the financial space, and then we'll go on to other examples
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.260]   as well.
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:44.060]   The example from the financial space simply has to do with how we create money.
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:54.020]   I myself don't think a lot of the modern Federal Reserve System of fiat money creation.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:19:01.020]   But where I've always tried to temper myself is to say, "Until I can clearly explain why
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:07.100]   fiat money was created to supersede the previous system and what was attractive about it, I
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:15.060]   should be cautious in just systematically waving my hand and saying it's for nothing."
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.900]   And I find this very interesting as an example.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.540]   Why did we disconnect money from the gold standard?
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:28.900]   Right now in our day there is increasing conversations about the need to anchor money to an external
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.300]   unchangeable standard.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.180]   And I'm a fan of those things.
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:38.780]   I'm not a flag-waving, unconditional supporter, but that makes a lot of sense to me because
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:44.900]   I look at the destruction that happens and inflation of fiat systems when government
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:51.900]   bureaucrats can just wave their hands and fund everything they want and destroy it.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.420]   Let's go back to that stanza from Kipling's poem.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:00.520]   In the Carboniferous epoch, we were promised abundance for all by robbing selected Peter
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.580]   to pay for collective Paul.
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.900]   Welcome to the "there's nothing new about the progressive tax systems, etc. that we
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.100]   live under and argue about today."
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.980]   Next line, "But though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy."
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.660]   And the gods of the copybook headings said, "If you don't work, you die."
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:27.220]   And so the point is simply that if you can't explain clearly the problems that the money
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:34.360]   system that was unlinked from the gold-backed system was trying to accomplish, then I hesitate
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:42.000]   to follow your advice about what the new system should be, because you can create a whole
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.220]   bunch of new problems.
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:54.200]   And we could do this in many—again, on social issues or on environmental issues.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:59.100]   If you go back and you look, I have a real passion for smart urban planning and urban
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.460]   design.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:08.060]   And what I find interesting is how we've, in many cases, transformed cities into hellscapes.
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:13.540]   Many modern cities, especially in the United States, just feel like urban hellscapes.
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.060]   They're not pleasant places to be.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.480]   Nobody wants to come and visit them.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:22.100]   And we go back to an old city in Europe and we walk around and we take our cameras and
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:29.500]   we dream of our vacation to Venice or we dream of our vacation to a small Swiss town or to
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.380]   a great kind of classic 500-year-old city.
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.180]   And people love to be in those places.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:43.020]   But we created something new without understanding what was brilliant about the old design.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:51.940]   And we ignored, in many cases, the collected wisdom of millennia of human experience.
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.860]   And we paved it all over in the United States.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:54.860]   We paved it all over.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.980]   We destroyed our cities and put parking lots up instead, made these massive roads.
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.380]   And they're just unpleasant places to be.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:08.740]   Last night I shared a great YouTube video by the Not Just Bikes channel, a wonderful
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.740]   channel on social commentary.
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.220]   It goes and talks about why nobody wants to raise children, why you should never live
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.820]   in the suburbs when you want to raise children.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.900]   I'd encourage you to look at it and think about it because it's a perfect encapsulation
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.100]   of this rule of unintended consequences.
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:31.620]   The suburbs in the United States, which were very, very commonly built, the suburbs were
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:37.860]   created without an understanding in a time of massive expansion where people didn't understand
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.260]   what was happening and what would be created.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.980]   And so the suburbs were created because people said, "Oh, that's where I want to go to
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.620]   raise my children."
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:51.620]   The suburbs became exceedingly car dependent and they kind of created this whole culture.
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:55.540]   But that culture itself is very, very unfriendly to children.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.180]   And it's funny, there's an argument about this, about, well, do people want to move
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.180]   to the suburbs when they have children?
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.180]   Right?
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.340]   I have four children, so I know something about this.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:08.300]   But while I appreciate certain aspects of the suburbs, and I try to be cautious in my
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.860]   commentary, what we created is a world that is completely unfriendly to children.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:19.700]   It continues to have ongoing impact on our child rearing.
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.060]   And our world continues to be emptied of children.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:27.820]   We could look at the same thing on social issues.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:32.740]   One of the single biggest issues of our day is population collapse.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.100]   We're not having children.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.060]   You can see this all over the world in different areas.
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:42.060]   In the United States, we can trace this back dramatically towards the rise of industrialization.
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.020]   We can trace this back to the invention of the birth control pill.
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:52.300]   We can trace this directly to liberalizing divorce laws, no-fault divorce, which started
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.300]   during the 1980s.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:24:02.280]   We can continue on through the era to today, through even to right now, the US Congress
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:08.640]   and Senate are debating the so-called Respect for Marriage Act.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.480]   And yet, if we look at the results of these things, we see that in reality, if marriage
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:20.940]   formation has collapsed, marriage continuation has fallen apart, and the production of children
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.740]   in our society has collapsed, which has massive impacts for the long term.
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:31.900]   So the social progressives that have wrought the future that we now live in didn't understand
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:37.860]   the things that contributed to a basic, functioning, stable society.
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:44.860]   And they've systematically built a world in which the idea of getting married is very
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.460]   unattractive, the idea of having children while continuing to be a strong biological
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.260]   urge is very unattractive, etc.
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.980]   So you can go and look at China, right?
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.220]   China is collapsing right now.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.700]   Why is China collapsing?
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:02.420]   Because social progressives and communists came in and said, "We have way too many people,
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.740]   population control is out of control."
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:11.980]   And so they came in and implemented the one-child policy, and in a single generation, an entire
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:18.780]   population is already and is going to be completely wrecked, with no ability to continue itself
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:28.660]   in a meaningful way, because a millennia-old civilization was destroyed in some decades
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.880]   by revolutionaries.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.780]   Now let's go to money and to finance.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:42.100]   We have to be on guard for this same thing happening in money and in finance, because
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:47.060]   there are always going to be – the more things change, the more they stay the same
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:56.420]   – there's always going to be these basic human impulses.
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.860]   There's always going to be swindlers, there's always going to be Ponzi schemes, there's
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:04.500]   always going to be people promising a brand new solution to a problem you didn't have,
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:10.740]   and you need to firmly keep in mind the truths that will endure.
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:15.060]   You need to firmly keep in mind these truths as you approach your life, your earning, your
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:22.500]   spending, your investments, and think about how you can align yourself with those long-won
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.020]   truths.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:31.200]   The question that I can't answer for you is, where do you draw the line?
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.740]   So let's deal with a couple of obvious examples.
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:44.020]   When we wade into the collapse of the cryptocurrency space over the last week, there is a strong
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:49.100]   distinction between the crypto people and the Bitcoiners.
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:54.500]   The Bitcoiners say everything except Bitcoin is worthless, and the crypto people say, "But
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.460]   we innovated on the back of Bitcoin."
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:05.780]   Now I myself am drawn and swayed to a distinction, to want to distinguish between Bitcoin and
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.300]   various other tokens that are made up and created.
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:15.100]   But at its core, let's be very humble and acknowledge that while indeed we may have
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:24.300]   solved a very long embedded problem with the ability to transact between individuals and
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:30.100]   to externally verify those transactions, Bitcoin may indeed have solved that problem in a new
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.740]   and innovative way.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:39.380]   Let's be exceedingly humble about the relative newness on the human stage.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:48.000]   And it concerns me deeply when individuals get so wrapped up in their revolutionary fervor
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.040]   and their ideological blindness that they ignore the wisdom of the ages.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.380]   They ignore the classic things like owning your home.
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:03.920]   They ignore the classic things like keeping cash on hand, etc., and put everything in
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.700]   favor of something new and revolutionary.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.520]   When everything is going up, it feels exciting, it feels euphoric.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:16.800]   But when all of a sudden you face brand new headwinds, the wisdom of the ages, the copybook
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.320]   headings come into play.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.800]   Now let's go back and go a step further.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:28.920]   Go back a century and you have a completely different perspective on stock market investing
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.960]   than we have today.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:36.360]   Today stock market investing, through the use of a balanced, diversified portfolio of
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.600]   mutual funds, is considered to be the wisdom of the ages.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.920]   But even there, I think we should always be skeptical.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:50.520]   I am perfectly fine with stock market investing, but stock market investing is a fundamentally
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.520]   new concept.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:58.120]   And even though it's more than a century old, it's still a fundamentally new concept.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:03.720]   And what has never been tested, to my knowledge, anywhere at any time in human history, is
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.080]   even the concept of broad-scale stock market investing.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:14.480]   If you went back 70 years and look at who owned stocks, it was a very small percentage
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.520]   of the population.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.200]   Wealthy elites who owned stocks.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:25.720]   You fast forward to today and increasingly, virtually all of the citizenry is engaged
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.000]   in stock market investing.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:35.440]   I don't oppose it, I support it, but I support balancing that with the wisdom of the ages,
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:40.240]   with the wisdom of other forms of assets, with the wisdom of owning physical assets,
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:45.200]   with the wisdom of being prudent with regard to debt and the modern financial system, etc.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.000]   And we can go back and back and back and back.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.240]   Now of course I've been reading systematically chapters from the excellent book The Richest
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.320]   Man in Babylon here on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:30:00.400]   That's an old book, it's in the public domain, that's why I'm reading the entirety of it.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:08.080]   It's an old and classic book, and that book is written as an allegory.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.880]   It's written in the context of it being a millennia old.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:16.120]   But what you see in that book is you see wisdom expressed.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:22.360]   Obviously the book is an invention of the modern age, but by using the old-fashioned
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:29.680]   language and the old-fashioned concepts, we can see the truth that has existed throughout
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.760]   time.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:36.600]   We can see that there very well could have been these characters who learned these lessons,
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:41.400]   and they learned their lessons in the context of copper pennies and pieces of silver and
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:49.060]   gold, and we apply them in our modern age through dollars or yen or pounds or euros,
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:57.060]   but yet those lessons are—there is a continuity, a similarity between these lessons that arches
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.260]   over the millennia.
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:05.560]   So it's very important that we study our history, that we understand past events of history,
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:13.920]   that we look at the arc of history, we understand what is the wisdom that does not change, and
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:20.920]   then how do we embrace the changes that are truly new and useful, that solve the problems
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.860]   of the past.
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:27.320]   And we need to understand that in order to look at our modern day.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:34.020]   This is clearly hard, because history in some cases is faster than we think it should be,
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.980]   and in some cases is much slower than we think it should be.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:42.500]   We think that our predictions of what will happen should happen immediately, but as I
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:49.140]   grow older what I realize is I can be more right—I can be very right on the direction
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:57.540]   of change, but I can find it very difficult to predict the timing of change.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:04.940]   I think about this—I guess a relationship would be—an example would be relationships
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.780]   and also financial events.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:14.260]   I have some close friends who have recently separated, husband and wife, and what's interesting
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:23.540]   to me is the arc of change, that the prediction of where they would wind up, has been obvious
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.260]   to me for a good number of years.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:32.540]   It started with financial problems, continuing financial problems, those financial problems
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:37.340]   weren't addressed, change didn't happen, and you could see the direction of change
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:42.620]   that seemed inevitable in terms of the relationship.
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:50.040]   But what couldn't be predicted was the particular timing at which the relationship would collapse.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:59.780]   And so as I've grown older I've learned to trust my intuition and my predictions on where
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:07.300]   things will go, but simultaneously to be less confident in my timing of exactly when things
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:13.460]   will go there, because sometimes good situations seem to continue long after we think they
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:19.080]   should end, and bad situations come at times that are completely unforeseen.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:27.380]   So we need to be cautious and try to incorporate history, but make plans that work well regardless
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:34.580]   of the particular timing of events.
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:42.180]   I want to close with my favorite quote on this tension.
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.940]   This of course comes from another author writing a century ago, G.K.
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:50.120]   Chesterton, the British author and commentator.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.520]   And this is the quote on progressives and conservatives that I think is so powerful
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.820]   for us to continue.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:56.820]   Here it is.
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:03.420]   "The whole modern world has divided itself into conservatives and progressives.
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:07.380]   The business of progressives is to go on making mistakes.
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:12.100]   The business of conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected.
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:16.820]   Even when the revolutionist might himself repent of his revolution, the traditionalist
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.980]   is already defending it as part of his tradition.
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:25.540]   Thus we have two great types, the advanced person who rushes us into ruin and the retrospective
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.980]   person who admires the ruins.
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.620]   He admires them especially by moonlight, not to say moonshine.
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:38.420]   Each new blunder of the progressive, or prig, becomes instantly a legend of immemorial antiquity
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.960]   for the snob.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.900]   This is called the balance, or mutual check, in our constitution."
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:52.780]   I share that because it's something I think about a lot, this tension between those who
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:57.620]   identify themselves as progressives and those who identify themselves as conservatives.
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:03.500]   I have broad application to this in the political and social sphere, but I'm less interested
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.980]   in the context of this particular podcast about that as I am in making sure that you
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:14.900]   think of yourself as someone who can understand that things should be changed and embrace
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:20.340]   new solutions without rushing headlong into them and making huge mistakes that are very
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:25.140]   difficult to recover from.
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:30.820]   We need to be informed by the past and we need to write our book of those things that
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.420]   will not change.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:36.100]   The wisdom of the ages is things that will not change.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:40.260]   I try to do that in my work at Radical Personal Finance.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:45.860]   That means that at times there are things that I miss, but what my desire to do is to
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:52.660]   focus on those concepts, those ideas, those principles that are timeless in their application,
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:36:00.020]   that will work just as well in 2022 as they did in 1922 or in 1622.
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:04.820]   My ambition is that those same things will work in the year 2622.
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:16.020]   Again, we don't know the specific tools, but we can see the course of history.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:21.260]   Although the specific tools will change, the dollar will have—I'll make my prediction,
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:25.660]   you can come back and do it—the dollar will have long ceased to exist and become utterly
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:28.220]   worthless by the year 2622.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.580]   How's that for a safe prediction?
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.340]   It's already collapsed multiple times.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.860]   No chance it makes it another century.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.900]   I don't know what will have replaced it.
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.140]   Pretty skeptical it's Bitcoin, but hey, who knows.
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:45.320]   The point is that whatever currency you're dealing with, you can deal with it intelligently
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:52.340]   between here and the year 2622 if you recognize that virtually all currencies collapse, but
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.060]   the value endures.
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:59.180]   This is why when you dig into what do the wealthy invest in, well, you invest into businesses
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:03.380]   that can change and adapt, and they can just switch out and say, "Hey, we'll start accepting
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.380]   this currency.
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:07.380]   We'll accept that currency from there," and they're building wealth and money and then
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:12.260]   turning around, investing it into hard assets and investing it into business expansion.
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.180]   And then, of course, the flip side is hard assets.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.780]   Why does Bill Gates, who made his fortune in computer software, why is he now one of
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.780]   the largest landowners in the United States?
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:28.220]   Because food and land are still continually important.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:31.540]   And so the lesson is not that you should go and invest in land if you're broke.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:37.780]   The lesson is that if you're looking for long-term perspectives, you need a business or a job
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.580]   that's going to create income for you.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:44.100]   Then once you have enough of it, you deploy it into multi-generational assets, et cetera.
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.100]   I'll continue.
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.100]   I want to close today.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.100]   That's enough.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:51.580]   I don't want to go on with example after example, but just recognize the importance of understanding
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:58.940]   the past and then making sure that you are being wise about what you're involved in today.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:05.220]   I want to close with, I'll read this poem to you again because there's great wisdom
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.620]   in here and I would encourage you now that you understand a little bit of the background,
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:13.700]   some of the terms, et cetera, listen again as we close today's show.
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:19.700]   The Gods of the Copybook Headings by Rudyard Kipling.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:26.340]   As I pass through my incarnations in every age and race, I make my proper prostrations
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.060]   to the gods of the marketplace.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:34.980]   Peering through reverent fingers, I watch them flourish and fall.
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:40.640]   And the gods of the copybook headings, I notice, outlast them all.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.940]   We were living in trees when they met us.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:47.940]   They showed us each in turn that water would certainly wet us, as fire would certainly
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.340]   burn.
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:54.740]   But we found them lacking in uplift, vision, and breadth of mind.
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:39:00.620]   So we left them to teach the gorillas while we followed the march of mankind.
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.520]   We moved as the spirit listed.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:10.020]   They never altered their pace, being neither cloud nor wind borne like the gods of the
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.880]   marketplace.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:17.240]   But they always caught up with our progress and presently word would come that a tribe
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:23.060]   had been wiped off its ice field or the lights had gone out in Rome.
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:27.320]   With the hopes that our world is built on, they were utterly out of touch.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.220]   They denied that the moon was Stilton.
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.160]   They denied she was even Dutch.
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.940]   They denied that wishes were horses.
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.180]   They denied that a pig had wings.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:41.840]   So we worshipped the gods of the market who promised these beautiful things.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:46.140]   When the Cambrian measures were forming, they promised perpetual peace.
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:51.860]   They swore if we gave them our weapons that the wars of the tribes would cease.
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:57.460]   But when we disarmed, they sold us and delivered us bound to our foe.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:02.480]   And the gods of the copybook headings said, "Stick to the devil you know."
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:07.180]   On the first Feminian sandstones, we were promised the fuller life, which started by
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:10.740]   loving our neighbor and ended by loving his wife.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:15.840]   Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:21.380]   And the gods of the copybook headings said, "The wages of sin is death."
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:26.820]   In the Carboniferous epoch, we were promised abundance for all by robbing selected Peter
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.500]   to pay for collective Paul.
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.620]   But though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy.
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:39.420]   And the gods of the copybook headings said, "If you don't work, you die."
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:44.380]   Then the gods of the market tumbled and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:49.300]   And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true, that all
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:53.060]   is not gold that glitters, and two and two make four.
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:57.880]   And the gods of the copybook headings limped up to explain it once more.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.580]   As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of man, there are only four things certain
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.500]   since social progress began.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:11.500]   That the dog returns to his vomit and the sow returns to her mire, and the burnt fool's
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.620]   bandaged finger goes wobbling back to the fire.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:19.980]   And that after this is accomplished and the brave new world begins, when all men are paid
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:26.020]   for existing and no man must pay for his sins, as surely as water will wet us, as surely
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:36.140]   as fire will burn, the gods of the copybook headings, with terror and slaughter, return.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.900]   Your tough Tacoma is here.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.320]   Your powerful 4Runner.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.820]   Your stylish Camry.
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.060]   Your versatile RAV4.
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:50.820]   Even your fully electric VZ4X.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:55.940]   Your new Toyota car, truck or SUV is available now.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.940]   So see your Toyota dealer today.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.700]   We make it easy.
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.660]   Toyota, let's go places.
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.660]   You
