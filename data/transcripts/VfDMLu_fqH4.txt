[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880]   As we draw near the end of 2013, we look back on God's grace on Desiring God, and it's been
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.880]   wonderful grace.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.880]   There's a lot going on at Desiring God now, lots of plans for the future.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.960]   Pastor John, when you think of the ministry of Desiring God, what happened in 2013, and
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.360]   what's to come in 2014, Lord willing, what excites you?
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.200]   Tony, it's strange, perhaps, but the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:40.280]   the blessings to Desiring God and through Desiring God is the impact on the life of
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.120]   suffering people.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.640]   One of the favorite texts at our ministry is "Sorrowful, Yet Always Rejoicing," 2 Corinthians
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.640]   6:10.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.800]   And everybody who knows us knows that we stand for Christian hedonism.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.240]   We're the people who say that joy is essential, that God is glorified in us when we're satisfied
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.400]   in Him.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:11.320]   And yet, the most consistent testimony to the benefit of the website, in my ears anyway
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:20.480]   as I travel, is people saying, "Thank you for help in getting through a tragedy."
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:28.520]   And so I'm thankful for the theology of suffering that pervades the website.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.320]   Through many tribulations, Christians must enter the kingdom.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.140]   And the prosperity gospel—I'm just back from the Middle East and from Africa, and
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:46.520]   everywhere I went, I dealt with people from dozens of countries who tell me that they
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.080]   have been affected, and the people around them have been affected by the prosperity
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.400]   gospel.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.160]   And they thanked me that Desiring God gives a perspective on suffering that is a corrective
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:08.000]   to the over-realization of future blessing that prosperity preachers push into this life
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.680]   with a minimization of a proper understanding of the role of sorrow and pain and affliction
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.020]   in the Christian life.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.360]   So I'm deeply thankful that we're all on one page here, that many of us—in fact,
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.240]   at this moment, God seems to be ordaining that some of our brothers are walking through
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.480]   really deep waters.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:39.400]   And I think the people that listen to us and come find a sweet sense of empathy when they're
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.040]   walking through hard times.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.600]   So that's the first thing.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.220]   People yet always rejoicing is all over this ministry, and I think thousands of people
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.720]   find that very, very helpful.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.480]   The second thing that comes to my mind, especially after travels, is the global impact.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.660]   The internet is simply an amazing instrument in God's hands that people from Pakistan
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:12.460]   and Nepal and Indonesia and Vietnam and Cambodia and Egypt and UAE and Ethiopia and Nigeria
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.260]   come up to me after these sessions where I'm speaking to groups of 70 nations and one after
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.380]   the other of every different color and shade and ethnicity thanking me for desiring God.
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:30.100]   I just would have never dreamed that I would go 6,000 miles away and have the same stories
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.900]   told to me that I hear when I do conferences here.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.700]   So praise God for the global impact of this ministry.
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.740]   And the next thing that comes to mind is the app development.
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.180]   I just love the fact that we're working on these special focus kind of ministries.
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.420]   The one we're doing right now, APJ, and your involvement in it, the Solid Joys app.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.620]   We're working on a brand new one that I won't give the title away yet, but it's a new app
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.500]   that will be a new way of teaching the Bible and the content of the Bible, how to read
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.700]   the Bible.
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.220]   And we think, we don't know of anybody else that's doing it quite this way.
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.820]   So we're really excited about that new app.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.060]   New leadership.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.300]   We just made a new hire in web project development, and I'm excited about that.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.220]   People I'm sure will hear more about that soon.
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.360]   So I'm real thankful that the leadership of DG is thinking strategically about the future
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.660]   and the kind of expertise that will be needed to maximize the impact of the web.
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:45.340]   And another one that comes to mind is I love Desiring God's way of thinking about money
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.420]   and marketing.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.460]   We believe in a wartime lifestyle, which is a little different than a simple lifestyle,
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.380]   although it implies measures of simplicity.
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.620]   We don't like to be opulent.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.620]   We want to be simple.
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:09.420]   But wartime means you think through your expenditures in personal living and in ministry living
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.560]   with a view to maximizing impact, not to maximize comfort.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.580]   So all the royalties and honorariums that I make go right back into ministry.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.780]   I don't take any of them for myself.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:27.540]   We give away for free everything online, almost 10,000 resources, they tell me now, not just
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.540]   5,000.
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.620]   We don't sell them.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.420]   We don't cause, we don't require any registration for them because we want to remove every possible
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.420]   obstacle.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:41.740]   I just love just lavishly throwing glorious things out there for anybody, anywhere, anytime
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.900]   in the world to have them with the fewest impediments possible.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.660]   We always have had this whatever you can afford policy so that if somebody wants a book or
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.140]   wants one of those crates of books we try to sell to encourage people to give them away,
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.180]   if they say, "I can't afford what you're charging," we'll say, "Well, what can you afford?"
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.180]   And we send it to them.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.660]   We've done that for 10 years and God's never, never let us down so that nobody has to be
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:12.300]   without a book that they need and that cherish for the upbuilding of their souls if they
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.580]   can't afford it.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.940]   We don't advertise on the website.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.100]   I could give all kinds of reasons for why I'm glad about that, but there's no big bar
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.580]   of advertising over on the right-hand side, which is a big way of making money that we
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.580]   don't do for various reasons.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.820]   And we just believe that focusing on the sovereign grace of God and the glories of Christ and
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.580]   the truth of the Bible creates joyful givers.
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.140]   Because I think $3 million of our $4 million budget comes through the participants who
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.300]   love us and give us gifts.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.060]   So I'm just thrilled.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.980]   And the last thing that I would say is that I'm excited mainly—I left it for last—because
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.620]   mainly the center of our message, God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.620]   in Him.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.620]   That's who we are.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:08.060]   We're people who have discovered that there's no need to choose between living for the glory
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.860]   of God and living in the fullness of joy.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.660]   Because even in the midst of suffering, God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.660]   in Him.
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.260]   That's the essence of our message, and that's why I love Desiring God.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.260]   Yes, amen.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.260]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.260]   And thank you for listening.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.300]   The Ministry of Desiring God, which includes initiatives like this daily podcast, Ask Pastor
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.820]   John, are made possible by the prayers and the financial generosity of many friends of
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.500]   the ministry like you.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.560]   And so as we near the end of 2013, we want to take a moment to thank everyone who supports
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:45.940]   the work of DG and those whose financial contributions make it possible for us to continue to build
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:51.400]   and administrate and steward DesiringGod.org as we labor daily to share the precious gospel
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.500]   of Jesus Christ with as many souls as we possibly can here in the United States and around the
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.500]   globe.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.340]   And if you'd like to partner with us in this work, you can do so online.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.760]   You can go to DesiringGod.org, click on "About Us," and then click on "Support DG."
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.740]   Your financial support is greatly appreciated by us.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:14.340]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, looking forward to sharing with you a fruitful and very innovative
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.460]   2014 online.
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.460]   We'll be back on Monday.
