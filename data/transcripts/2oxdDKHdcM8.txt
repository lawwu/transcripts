[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   The following is a conversation with Ivanka Trump, businesswoman, real estate developer,
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   and former senior advisor to the President of the United States.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.720]   I've gotten to know Ivanka well over the past two years. We've become good friends. Hitting it off
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.240]   right away over our mutual love of reading, especially philosophical writings from Marcus
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.840]   Aurelius, Joseph Campbell, Alan Watts, Viktor Frankl, and so on. She is a truly kind, compassionate,
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.760]   and thoughtful human being. In the past, people have attacked her, in my view, to get indirectly
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.200]   at her dad, Donald Trump, as part of a dirty game of politics and clickbait journalism.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.800]   These attacks obscured many projects and efforts, often bipartisan, that she helped get done,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.480]   and they obscured the truth of who she is as a human being. Through all that, she never returned
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.800]   the attacks with anything but kindness, and always walked through the fire of it all with grace.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.800]   For this, and much more, she is an inspiration, and I'm honored to be able to call her a friend.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:19.920]   Oh, and for those living in the United States, happy upcoming 4th of July. It's both
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.200]   an anniversary of this country's declaration of independence, and an anniversary of my
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.760]   immigrating here to the U.S. I am forever grateful for this amazing country,
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:39.200]   for this amazing life, for all of you who have given a chance to a silly kid like me.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.040]   From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I love you all.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.880]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.600]   And now, dear friends, here's Ivanka Trump. You said that ever since you were young,
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.880]   you wanted to be a builder, that you loved the idea of designing beautiful city skylines,
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.680]   especially in New York City. I love the New York City skyline. So describe the origins
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.400]   of that love of building. You know, I think there's
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.600]   both an incredible confidence and a total insecurity that comes with youth. So I remember
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.440]   at 15, I would look out over the city skyline from my bedroom window in New York and
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:36.160]   imagine where I could contribute and add value in a way that, you know, I look back on and
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.440]   completely laugh at, you know, how confident I was. But I've known since some of my earliest
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.120]   memories, it's something I've wanted to do. And I think fundamentally, I love art. I love
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:55.280]   expressions of beauty in so many different forms. With architecture, there's the tangible.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.640]   And I think that marriage of function and something that exists beyond yourself is very
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.600]   compelling. I also grew up in a family where my mother was in the real estate business working
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.760]   alongside my father. My father was in the business, and I saw the joy that it brought
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.560]   to them. So I think I had these natural positive associations. They used to send me as a little
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.640]   girl renderings of projects they were about to embark on with notes asking if I would
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.600]   hurry up and finish school so I could come join them. So I had these positive associations,
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.040]   but it came from something within myself. I think that as I got older and as I got involved
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.280]   in real estate, I realized that it was so multidisciplinary. You have, of course, the
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.400]   design, but you also have engineering, the brass tacks of construction. There's time
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.000]   management. There's project planning. Just the duration of time to complete one of these
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.600]   iconic structures, it's enormous. You can contribute a decade of your life to one project.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.760]   So while you have to think big picture, it means you really have to care deeply about the details
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.400]   because you live with them. So it allowed me to flex a lot of areas of interest.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   I love that confidence of youth.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.800]   It's funny because we're all so insecure in the most basic interactions, but yet our
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:26.400]   ambitions are so unbridled in a way that makes you blush as an adult. I think it's fun. It's
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.720]   fun to tap into that energy.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.680]   Yeah, where everything is possible. I think some of the greatest builders I've ever met
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.120]   always have that little flame of everything is possible still burning. That is a silly
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.840]   notion from youth, but it's not so silly. Everybody tells you something is impossible,
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.360]   but if you continue believing that it's possible and have that naive notion that you could do it,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.680]   even if it's exceptionally difficult, that naive notion turns into some of the greatest projects
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.240]   ever done.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.360]   A hundred percent.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.320]   Going out to space or building a new company where like everybody said, it's impossible,
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.720]   taking on a gigantic company and disrupting them and revolutionizing how stuff is done
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.040]   or doing huge building projects where, like you said, so many people are involved in making
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.840]   that happen.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.760]   We get conditioned out of that feeling.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:23.520]   We start to become insecure and we start to rely on the input or validation of others,
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:32.480]   and it takes us away from that sort of core drive and ambition. So it's fun to reflect
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.440]   on that and also to smile, right? Because whether you can execute or not, time will tell.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.240]   But yeah, no, that was very much my childhood.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.040]   Yeah, of course, it's important to also have the humility of once you
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.680]   get humbled and realize that it's actually a lot of work to build. I still am amazed just
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.680]   looking at big buildings, big bridges, that human beings are able to get together and
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.440]   build those things. That's one of my favorite things about architecture is just like,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:09.280]   wow, it's a manifestation of the fact that humans can collaborate and do something like
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.080]   EPIC much bigger than themselves. And it's like a statue that represents that and it
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.280]   can be there for a long time.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:23.760]   I think in some ways you look out at different city skylines and it's almost like a visual
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:30.080]   depiction of ambition realized, right? Like it's a testament to somebody's dream, not
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:39.120]   somebody, a whole ensemble of people's dreams and visions and triumphs and in some cases
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:45.840]   failures if the projects weren't properly executed. So you look at these skylines and
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.440]   it's a testament to that. I actually heard once architecture described as frozen music
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.000]   that really resonated with me.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.640]   I love thinking about a city skyline as an ensemble of dreams realized.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:06.480]   Yeah. I remember the first time I went to Dubai and I was watching them dredging out
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.760]   and creating these man-made islands. And I remember somebody once saying to me there,
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:18.800]   an architect actually who collaborated with us on our tower in Chicago, he said that the
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.880]   only thing that limited what an architect could do in that area was gravity and imagination.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.320]   So it's, you know.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.080]   Yeah, but gravity is a tricky one to work against. And that's where civil engineering
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.720]   is one of my favorite things. I used to build bridges in high school for physics classes.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.480]   You have to build bridges and you compete on how much weight they can carry relative
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:47.360]   to their own weight. You study how good it is by finding its breaking point. And that
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.640]   was a deep appreciation for me on a miniature scale of, on a large scale, what people are
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.720]   able to do with civil engineering. Because gravity is a tricky one to fight against.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.480]   It definitely is. And bridges, I mean, some of the iconic designs in our country
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.080]   are incredible bridges.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.400]   So if we think of skylines as ensembles of dreams realized, you spent quite a bit of
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:16.880]   time in New York. What do you love about and what do you think about the New York City skyline?
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.680]   What's a good picture? We're looking here at a few. I mean, looking over the water.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:28.320]   Well, I think the water is an unbelievable feature of the New York skyline. As you see
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.520]   the island on approach and oftentimes you'll see like in these images, you'll see these
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:40.400]   towers reflecting off of the water surface. So I think there's something very beautiful and
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:47.360]   unique about that. When I look at New York, I see this unbelievable sort of tapestry of
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.840]   different types of architecture. So you have the Gothic form as represented by buildings like the
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:00.640]   Woolworth Building or you'll have Art Deco as represented by buildings like 40 Wall Street or
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:07.040]   the Chrysler Building or Rockefeller Center. And then you'll have these unbelievable super
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.960]   modern examples or modernist examples like Lever House and Seagram's House. So you have all of
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.480]   these different styles. And I think to build in New York, you're really building the best of the
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:25.600]   best. So nobody's giving New York their sort of second-rate work. And especially when a lot of
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.640]   those buildings were built, there was this incredible competition happening between New
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:38.160]   York and Chicago for kind of dominance of the sky and for who could create the greatest skyline,
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.400]   this sort of race to the sky when skyscrapers were first being built starting in Chicago and
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:50.880]   then New York surpassing that in terms of height at least with the Empire State Building. So I love
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:58.080]   sort of contextualizing the skylines as well and thinking back to when different components
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.360]   that are so iconic were added and the context in which they came into being.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:09.280]   I gotta ask you about this. There's a pretty cool page that I've been following on X,
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:15.200]   Architecture and Tradition, and they celebrate sort of traditional schools of architecture.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.080]   And you mentioned Gothic, the tapestry. This is in Chicago, the Tribune Tower in Chicago.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.720]   So what do you think about that, sort of the old and the new mixed together? Do you like Gothic?
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.840]   I think it's hard to look at something like the Tribune Tower and not be
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.520]   completely in awe. This is an unbelievable building. Look at those buttresses and you've
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:41.680]   got gargoyles hanging off of it. And this style was reminiscent of the cathedrals of Europe,
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.760]   which was very kind of in vogue in like the 1920s here in America. Actually,
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.960]   I mentioned the Woolworth Tower before. The Woolworth Tower was actually referred to as
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:59.280]   the Cathedral of Commerce, because it also was in that Gothic style.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.640]   Amazing.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.840]   So this was built maybe a decade before the Tribune Building.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:11.280]   But the Tribune Building to me is almost not replicable. It personally really resonates
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.000]   with me because one of the first projects I ever worked on was building Trump Chicago,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.760]   which was this beautiful, elegant, super modern, all glass skyscraper right across the way. So it
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.560]   was right across the river. So I would look out the windows as it was under construction or be
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:35.520]   standing quite literally on rebar of the building looking out at the Tribune and incredibly inspired.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:41.360]   And now the reflective glass of the building reflects back not only the river, but also
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.080]   the Tribune Building and other buildings on Michigan Avenue.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.000]   Do you like it when the glass, the reflective properties of the glass as part of the
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.040]   architecture?
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.600]   I think it depends. Like they have super reflective glass that sometimes doesn't
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:03.520]   work. It's distracting. And I think it's one component of sort of a composition that comes
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:09.200]   together. I think in this case, the glass on Trump Chicago is very beautiful. It was designed by
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:16.000]   Adrian Smith of Skidmore Owings in Maryland, a major architecture firm who actually did the
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.680]   Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which is I think like an awe-inspiring example of modern architecture.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:29.600]   But glass is tricky. You have to get the shade right. You know, some glass has a lot of iron
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:36.400]   in it and gets super green. And that's a choice. And sometimes you have more blue properties,
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.560]   blue-silver, like you see here. But it's part of the character.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.680]   How do you know what it's actually going to look like when it's done?
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.520]   Like, is it possible to imagine that? Because it feels like there's so many variables.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:54.960]   I think so. I think if you have a vivid imagination and if you sit with it, and then if you also go
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:02.000]   beyond the rendering, right? You have to live with the materials. So you don't build a 92-story
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:10.400]   building, glass curtain wall, and not deeply examine the actual curtain wall before purchasing
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:16.080]   it. So you have to spend a lot of time with the actual materials, not just the beautiful sort of
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:23.680]   artistic renderings, which can be incredibly misleading. The goal is actually that the end
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:32.240]   result is much, much more compelling than what the architect or artist rendered. But oftentimes,
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.440]   that's very much not the case. You know, sometimes also you mention context. Sometimes I'll see
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.440]   renderings of buildings. I'm like, "Wait, what about the building right to the left of it that's
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:47.840]   blocking 80% of its views?" You know, architects, they'll remove things that are inconvenient.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.320]   So you have to be rooted in reality.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.240]   In reality, exactly.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:00.560]   And I love the notion of living with the materials in contrast to living in the imagined world of
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:07.600]   the drawings. So both are probably important because you have to dream the thing into existence,
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.600]   but you also have to be rooted in what the thing is actually going to look like in the context of
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.080]   everything else.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.960]   A hundred percent.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.760]   One of the underlying principles of the page I just mentioned, and I hear folks mention this a
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:24.000]   lot, is that modern architecture is kind of boring, that it lacks soul and beauty. And you just spoke
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.560]   with admiration for both modern and for Gothic, for older architectures. So do you think there's
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.360]   truth that modern architecture is boring?
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:41.600]   I'm living in Miami currently, so I see a lot of super uninspired glass boxes on the waterfront.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:49.840]   But I think exceptional things shouldn't be the norm. They're typically rare. And I think in
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:57.440]   modern architecture, you find an abundance of amazing examples of super compelling and
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:03.200]   innovative building designs. I mean, I mentioned the Burj Khalifa. It is awe-inspiring. This is an
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:10.080]   unbelievably striking example of modern architecture. You look at some older examples,
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.640]   the Sydney Opera House. So I think there's unbelievable. There you go.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.440]   I mean, it's like a needle in the sky.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.640]   Yeah, reaching out to the stars.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   It's huge. And in the context of a city where there's a lot of height. So it's unbelievable.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:34.320]   But I think one of the things that's probably exciting me the most about architecture right
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:40.320]   now is the innovation that's happening within it. You know, there's example of robotic fabrication,
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:46.720]   there's 3D printing. Your friend and who you introduced me to not too long ago,
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:53.200]   Neri Oxman, what she's doing at the intersection of biology and technology, and thinking about
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:16:00.240]   how to create more sustainable development practices, quite literally trying to create
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:05.200]   materials that will biodegrade back into the earth. I think there's something really cool
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.000]   happening now with the rediscovery of ancient building techniques. So you have self-healing
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:18.240]   concrete that was used by the Romans, an art and a practice of using volcanic ash and lime
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:24.080]   that's now being rediscovered and is more critical than ever as we think about how much of our
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:29.840]   infrastructure relies on concrete and how much of that is failing on the most basic levels.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:36.400]   So I think actually, it's a really, really exciting time for innovation in architecture.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:44.240]   And I think there are some incredible examples of modern design that are really exciting.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:50.240]   But generally, I think Roosevelt said that comparison is the thief of joy.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.400]   So it's hard. You know, you look at the Tribune Building, you look at some of these iconic
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:00.080]   structures. One of the buildings I'm most proud to have worked on was the historical post office
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:06.480]   building in Washington, D.C. You look at a building like that, and it feels like it has no equal.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.760]   Also, there's a psychological element where people tend to want to complain about the new
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.520]   and celebrate the old.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.880]   Always. It's like the history of time.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:23.760]   People are always skeptical and concerned about change. And it's true that there's a lot of stuff
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.680]   that's new, that's not good, that's not going to last. It's not going to stand the test of time.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:34.080]   But some things will. And just like in modern art and modern music, there's going to be
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.960]   artists that stand the test of time. And we'll later look back and celebrate them.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.000]   Those are the good times.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.920]   When you just step back, what do you love about architecture?
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.800]   Is it the beauty? Is it the function?
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:56.320]   I'm most emotionally drawn, obviously, to the beauty. But I think as somebody who's built
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.280]   things, I really believe that the form has to follow the function. There's nothing uglier
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:13.920]   than a space that is ill-conceived. Otherwise, it's decoration. And I think that after that
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:20.480]   initial reaction to seeing something that's aesthetically really pleasing to me when I look
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:28.240]   at a building or a project, I love sort of thinking about how it's being used.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:36.960]   So having been able to build so many things in my career and worked on so many incredible
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.280]   projects, I mean, it's really, really rewarding after the fact to have somebody come up to you
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:48.800]   and tell you that they got engaged in the lobby of your building or they got married
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:54.160]   in the ballroom and share with you some of those experiences. So to me, that's
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:00.640]   equally as beautiful, the use cases for these unbelievable projects.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:11.040]   But I think it's all of it. I love that you've got the construction and you've got the
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.400]   design and you've got then the interior design and you've got the financing elements,
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:22.480]   the marketing elements, and it's all wrapped up in this one effort. So to me,
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.520]   it's exciting to sort of flex in all those different ways.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:33.040]   Yeah. Like you said, it's dreams realized, hard work realized. I mean, probably on the bridge
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.400]   side is why I love the function in terms of function being primary. You just think of like
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:44.400]   the millions of bridges. Oh my gosh, look at that. Go down. You had...
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:50.560]   Look at that. Yeah, this is devil's bridge in Germany.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:55.760]   Yeah. I wouldn't say it's like the most practical design, but look how beautiful that is.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.680]   Yeah. So this is probably, well, we don't know. We need to interview some people whether the
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.440]   function holds up, but in terms of beauty and then like what we're talking about,
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.120]   using the water for the reflection and the shape that creates. I mean,
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.680]   there's an elegance to the shape of a bridge.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.440]   See, it's interesting that they call it devil's bridge because to me, this is
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.720]   very ethereal. I think about the ring, the circle, life.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.720]   There's nothing about this that makes me feel... Maybe they're just being ironic in the name.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.560]   Unless that function's really flawed.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.840]   Yeah, exactly. Maybe...
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.080]   Nobody's ever successfully crossed.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.960]   Who crossed the bridge, yeah. But I mean, to me, there's just iconic... I love looking at bridges
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.240]   because of the function. It's the Brooklyn Bridge or the Golden Gate Bridge. I mean,
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.920]   those are probably my favorites in the United States. Just in a city to be able to look out
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:51.040]   and see the skyline combined with the suspension bridge and thinking of all the millions of cars
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:57.120]   that pass, like the busyness, like us humans getting together and going to work, building
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:04.000]   cool stuff. And just the bridge kind of represents the turmoil and the busyness of a city as it
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.360]   creates. It's cool.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.120]   And the connectivity as well.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:12.800]   Yeah. The network of roads all come together. So there, the bridge is the ultimate combination
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.600]   of function and beauty.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.320]   Yeah. I remember when I was first learning about bridges, studying the cable stay
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:27.200]   versus the suspension bridge. And I mean, you actually built many replicas, so I'm sure you'll
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:33.520]   have a point of view on this, but they really are so beautiful. And you mentioned the Brooklyn
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:39.120]   Bridge, but growing up in New York, that was as much a part of the architectural story
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:44.800]   and tapestry of that skyline as any building that's seen in it.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:51.280]   What in general is your philosophy, philosophy of design and building in architecture?
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:57.840]   Well, some of the most recent projects I worked on prior to government service were the old
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:04.560]   post office building and almost simultaneously Trump Doral in Miami. So these were both two
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:11.120]   just massive undertakings, both redevelopments, which in a lot of cases, having worked on
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:17.280]   ground-up construction, redevelopment projects are in a lot of ways much more complicated
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:23.840]   because you have existing attributes, but also a lot of limitations you have to work
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.520]   within, especially when you're repurposing a use. So this, the old post office building
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.000]   on Pennsylvania Avenue was- So beautiful.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:40.320]   It's unbelievable. So this was a Romanesque revival building built in the 1890s on America's
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:48.320]   Main Street to symbolize American grandeur. And at the time, there were post office being built
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:53.760]   in the style across the country, but this being really the defining one. Still to this day,
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:59.040]   the tallest habitable structure in Washington, the tallest structure being the monument,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:05.040]   the nation's only vertical park, which is that clock tower. But you've got these thick granite
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:12.880]   walls, those carved granite turrets, just an unbelievable building. You've got this massive
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:20.800]   atrium that runs through the whole center of it that is topped with glass. So having the opportunity
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:27.440]   to spearhead a project like that was so exciting. And actually, it was my first renovation project.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:34.960]   So I came to it with a tremendous amount of energy, vigor, and humility about how to do it
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:42.720]   properly, ensuring I had all the right people. We had countless federal and local government
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.760]   agencies that would oversee every single decision we made. But in advance of even having the
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:54.880]   opportunity to do it, there was a close to two-year request for proposal, like a process
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:00.560]   that was put out by the General Services Administration. So it was this really arduous
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:07.040]   government procurement process that we were competing against so many different people
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:13.200]   for the opportunity, which a lot of people said it was a gigantic waste of time. But I looked at
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.600]   that, and I think so did a lot of the other bidders, and say it's worth trying to put the
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.640]   best vision forward. So you fell in love with this project? I fell in love, yeah. So is there some
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:28.800]   interesting details about what it takes to do renovation? Is there about some of the challenges
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:37.760]   or opportunities? Because you want to maintain the beauty of the old and now upgrade the
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:46.080]   functionality, I guess, and maybe modernize some aspects of it without destroying what made the
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:51.520]   building magical in the first place. So I think the greatest asset was already there,
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.480]   the exterior of the building, which we meticulously restored. And any addition to
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:03.680]   it had to be done sort of very gently in terms of any signage additions. And
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:13.600]   the interior spaces were completely dilapidated. It had been in a post office. Then it was used for
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:21.360]   a really rundown food court and government office spaces. It was actually losing $6 million a year
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:30.960]   when we got the concession to build it and when we won and became one of, I think, a great example
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:36.960]   of public-private partnerships working together. But I think the biggest challenge in having such
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:45.200]   a radical use conversion is just how you lay it out. So the amount of time I would get on that
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:51.600]   Acela twice a week, three times a week to spend day trips down in Washington, and we would walk
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:57.520]   every single inch of the building, laying out the floor plans, debating over the configuration of a
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:04.960]   room. There were almost 300 rooms, and there were almost 300 layouts. So nothing could be repeated.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:13.280]   Whereas when you're building from scratch, you have a box, and you decide where you want to add
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:21.040]   potential elements, and you kind of can stack the floor plan all the way up. But when you're
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.440]   working within a building like this, every single room was different. You see the setback. So the
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:33.280]   setback then required you to move the plumbing. So there was no--it was really a labor of love.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.760]   And to do something like this--and that's why I think renovation--we had it with Doral as well.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:48.800]   It was 700 rooms over 650 acres of property. And so every single unit was very different
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:55.280]   and complicated. Not as complicated in some ways. The scale of it was so massive, but not as
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:01.120]   complicated as the old post office. But it required a level of precision. And I think in real estate,
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:08.560]   you have a lot of people who design on plan, and a lot of people who are in the business of sort of
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.760]   acquiring and flipping. So it's more financial engineering than it is
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:21.120]   building. And they don't spend the time sort of sweating these details that make something
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:28.880]   great and make something functional. And you feel it in the end result. But I mean, blood, sweat,
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:36.800]   tears, years of my life for those projects. And it was worth it. I enjoyed almost every minute of it.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:42.480]   So to you, it's not about the flipping. To you, it's about the art and the function
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.360]   of the thing that you're creating. A hundred percent.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.480]   What's design on plan? I'm learning new things today.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:56.160]   When proposals are put forth by an architect and really just the plan is accepted without--and
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.560]   in the case of a renovation, like if you're not walking those rooms, the number of times
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:07.840]   a beautifully laid out room was on a blueprint. And then I'd go to Washington and I'd walk that
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.840]   floor and I'd realize that there was a column that ran right up through the middle of the space where
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:18.560]   the bed was supposed to be or the toilet was supposed to be or the shower. So there's a lot
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:26.960]   of things that are missed when you do something conceptually without sort of rooting it in
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:32.320]   the actual structure. And that's why I think even with ground-up construction as well,
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:37.200]   people who aren't constantly on their job sites, constantly walking the projects,
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.800]   there's just a lot that's missed.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:47.920]   I mean, there's a wisdom to the idea that we talked about before, live with the materials and
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.320]   walking the construction site, walk in the rooms. I mean, that's what you hear from
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:57.280]   people like Steve Jobs, like Elon. That's why you live on the factory floor. That's why you
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:04.560]   constantly obsess about the details, the actual, not of the plans, but the physical reality of the
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:11.520]   product. I mean, the insanity of Steve Jobs and Johnny I working together on making it perfect,
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:17.120]   making the iPhone, the early designs, prototypes, making that perfect, what it actually feels like
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:24.720]   in the hand. You have to be there as close to the metal as possible to truly understand.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   And you have to love it in order to do that.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.600]   Right. It shouldn't be about how much it's going to sell for, all that kind of stuff.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.800]   You have to love the art.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.440]   Because for the most part, you can probably get 90, maybe even 95% of the end result,
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:43.360]   unless something has terribly gone awry by not caring with that level of
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:50.800]   almost like maniacal precision. But you'll notice that 10% for the rest of your life.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:30:01.760]   I think that extra effort, that passion, I think that's what separates good from great.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:09.600]   If we go back to that young Ivanka, the confidence of youth, and if we could talk about your mom,
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.480]   she had a big influence on you. You told me she was an adventurer.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.540]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:20.720]   Olympic skier and a businesswoman. What did you learn about life from your mother?
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:32.240]   So much. She passed away two years ago now, and she was a remarkable, remarkable woman.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:38.480]   She was a trailblazer in so many different ways. As an athlete and growing up in communist
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:44.880]   Czechoslovakia, as a fashion mogul, as a real estate executive and builder,
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:50.400]   just this all-around trailblazing businesswoman.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:59.360]   I also learned from her, aside from that element, how to really enjoy life. I look back and some of
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:08.400]   my happiest memories of her are in the ocean, just lying on her back, looking up at the sun and just
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:17.520]   so in the moment, or dancing. She loved to dance. She really taught me a lot about living life to
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:26.720]   its fullest, and she had so much courage, so much conviction, so much energy, and a complete comfort
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:27.760]   with who she was.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.440]   What do you think about that? I mean, Olympic athlete, the trade-off between
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:38.880]   ambition and just wanting to do big things and pursuing that and giving your all to that,
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:44.800]   and being able to relax and just throw your arms back and enjoy every moment of life.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.920]   But that trade-off, what do you think about that trade-off?
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:58.080]   I think because she was this unbelievable, formidable athlete, and because of the discipline
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:05.680]   she had as a child, I think it made her value those moments more as an adult. I think she was
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:11.120]   a great balance of the two that we all hope to find, and she was able to find both incredibly
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   serious and formidable. I remember as a little girl, I used to literally traipse behind her
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:25.600]   at the Plaza Hotel, which she oversaw, and actually kind of was her old post office. It
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:31.920]   was this unbelievable historic hotel in New York City, and I'd follow her around at construction
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:40.000]   meetings and on job sites, and there she is dancing. See? That's funny that that's the
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.680]   picture you pull up. I'm sorry. That's great. The two of you just look great in that picture.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:52.800]   That's great. She had such a joy to her, and she was so unabashed in her perspective
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:33:00.560]   and her opinions. I mean, she made my father look reserved, so whatever she was feeling,
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.120]   she was just very expressive and a lot of fun to be around.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:13.680]   So she, as you mentioned, grew up during the Prague Spring in 1968, and that had a big impact
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:18.880]   on human history. I mean, my family came from the Soviet Union, and then the 20th century,
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:27.760]   the story of the 20th century is a lot of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union tried the ideas of
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:36.320]   communism, and it turned out that a lot of those ideas resulted into a lot of suffering.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.360]   So why do you think the communist ideology failed?
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:47.360]   I think fundamentally, as people, we desire freedom. We want agency. And my mom was like
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:52.960]   a lot of other people who grew up in similar situations where she didn't like to talk about
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:34:00.720]   it that often. So one of my real regrets is that I didn't push her harder. But I think back to the
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:07.520]   conversations we did have, and I try to imagine what it's like. She was at Charles University in
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:16.800]   Prague, which was really like a focal point of the reforms that were ushered in during the Prague
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.520]   Spring and the liberalization agenda that was happening. The dance halls were opening, the
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:29.440]   student activists, and she was attending university there right at that same time. So the contrast to
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:39.040]   this feeling of freedom and progress and liberalization in the spring, and then it's so
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:48.320]   quickly being crushed in the fall of that same year when the Warsaw Pact countries and the Soviet
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:56.080]   Union rolled in to put down and ultimately roll back all those reforms. So for her to have lived
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:04.400]   through that, you know, she didn't come to North America until she was 23 or 24. So that was her
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:12.960]   life. As a young girl, she was on the junior national ski team for Czechoslovakia. My
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:18.400]   grandfather used to train her. They used to put the skis on her back and walk up the mountain
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:24.000]   in Czechoslovakia because there were no ski lifts. She actually made me do that when I was a child,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:31.360]   just to let me know what her experience had been. If I complained that it was cold out,
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.800]   she's like, "Well, you didn't have to walk up the mountain. You'd be plenty warm if you
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:41.520]   had carried the skis up on your back up the last run." I feel like they made people tougher back
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.880]   then. Like my grandma, and you mentioned it's funny, they go through some of the darkest things
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.840]   that a human being can go through and they don't talk about it. And they have a general positive
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:36:00.320]   outlook on life that's deeply rooted in the knowledge of what life could be. Like how bad
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:09.440]   it could get. My grandma survived Holodomor in Ukraine, which was a mass starvation brought on
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.560]   by the collectivist policies of the Stalin regime. And then she survived the Nazi occupation of
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:22.400]   Ukraine, never talked about it, probably went through extremely dark, extremely difficult times,
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:29.520]   and then just always had a positive outlook on life. And also made me do very difficult physical
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:34.960]   activity, like you mentioned, just to humble you. Like kids these days are soft kind of energy,
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:40.880]   which I'm deeply, deeply grateful for. On all fronts, including just having hardship,
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:46.160]   including just physical hardship flung at me. I think that's really important.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:52.720]   You wonder how much of who they were was a reaction to their experience. Would she have
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:59.760]   naturally had that sort of forward-looking, grateful, optimistic orientation? Or was it
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.240]   a reaction to her childhood? I think about that. I look at this picture of my mom
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:12.720]   and she was unabashedly herself. She loved flamboyance and glamour. And in some ways,
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:19.600]   I think it probably was a direct reaction to this very austere, controlled childhood. This
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:25.360]   was one expression of it. I think how she dressed and how she presented. I think her
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:33.280]   entrepreneurial spirit and love of capitalism and all things American was another manifestation of
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:40.640]   it and one that I grew up with. I remember the story she used to tell me about when she was
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:49.520]   14 and she was going to neighboring countries. And as an athlete, you were given additional
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:58.560]   freedoms that you wouldn't otherwise be afforded in these societies under communist rules. So,
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:03.120]   she was able to travel where most of her friends never would be able to leave Czechoslovakia.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:08.880]   And she would come back from all of these trips and the first place where she'd do ski races in
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:13.120]   Austria and elsewhere, the first thing she had to do was check in at the local police.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:22.400]   And she'd sit down and she had enough wisdom at 14 to know that she couldn't appear to be lying
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.680]   by not being impressed by what she saw and the fact that you could get an orange in the winter,
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:33.040]   but she couldn't be too excited by it that she'd become a flight risk. So, give enough
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:41.600]   details that you're believable, but not so many that you're not trusted. And imagine that as a
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:50.080]   14-year-old, that experience and having to navigate the world that way. And she told me
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:55.840]   that eventually all those local police officers, they came to love her because one of the things
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.480]   she'd do is smuggle that stuff back from these countries and give it to them to give their wives
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:09.040]   perfume and stockings. So, she figured out the system pretty quickly. But it's a very different
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:14.800]   experience from what I was navigating and the pressures and challenges me as a 14-year-old
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:23.520]   was dealing with. So, I have so much respect and admiration for her. Yeah, hardship clarifies what's
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:29.120]   important in life. You and I have talked about Man's Search for Meaning, that book, having kind
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:36.800]   of an ultimate hardship clarifies that finding joy in life is not about the environment, it's about
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:43.840]   your outlook on that environment. And there's beauty to be found in any situation. And also in
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:49.120]   that particular situation, when everything is taken from you, the thing you start to think about is
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.680]   the people you love. So, in the case of Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl,
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:40:01.360]   thinking about his wife and how much he loves her. And that love was the flame, the warmth that kept
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.760]   him excited. The fun thing to think about when everything else is gone. So, we sometimes forget
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.160]   that with the busyness of life, you get all this fun stuff we're talking about, like building and
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:14.960]   being a creative force in the world. At the end of the day, what matters is just like the other
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:20.640]   humans in your life, the people you love. It's the simple stuff. You know, Viktor Frankl is somebody,
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:28.560]   I mean, his, that book and just his philosophy in general is so inspiring to me. But I think so many
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:33.760]   people, they say they want happiness, but they want conditional happiness. You know, when this
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:38.960]   and this, a thing happens, or under these circumstances, then I'll be happy. And I think
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:47.280]   what he showed is that we can sort of cultivate these virtues within ourselves, regardless of the
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:54.160]   situation we find ourselves in. And in some ways, I think the meaning of life is the search for
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:41:00.080]   meaning in life. It's the relationships we have and we form. It's the experience we have. It's
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:08.080]   how we deal with the suffering that life inevitably presents to us. And Viktor Frankl does an amazing
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:15.920]   job highlighting that under the most horrific circumstances. And I think it's just super
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:22.800]   inspiring to me. He also shows that you can get so much from just like small joys, like getting
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.840]   a little more soup today than you did yesterday. I mean, it's like, it's the little stuff. If you
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:35.200]   allow yourself to love the little stuff of life, it's all around you. It's all there. So you don't
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:40.080]   need to like have these ambitious goals and the comparison being a thief of joy, that kind of
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:46.640]   stuff. Just like it's all around us, the ability to eat. Like when I was in the jungle and I got
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:53.520]   severely dehydrated, because there's no water, you run out of water real quick. And I mean,
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:42:00.480]   the joy I felt when I got to drink, like I didn't care about anything else. Speaking of things that
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:05.440]   matter in life, I would start to fantasize about water and that was bringing me joy.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:12.160]   - You can tap into this feeling at any time. - Yeah, exactly. I was just tapping in just
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.440]   to stay positive. - Just go into your bathroom,
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.360]   turn on the sink, watch the water. - Oh, for sure. For sure. I mean,
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:24.240]   people really, it's good to have stuff taken away for a time. That's why struggle is good,
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:29.600]   to make you appreciate, to have a deep gratitude for when you have it. And water and food is a big
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:34.880]   one, but water is the biggest one. I wouldn't recommend it necessarily to get severely
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:39.120]   dehydrated to appreciate water, but maybe every time you take a sip of water, you can have that
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.560]   kind of gratitude. - There's a prayer in Judaism
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:49.520]   you're supposed to say every morning, which is basically thanking God for your body working.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:58.640]   It's something so basic, but it's when it doesn't that we're grateful. So just reminding ourselves
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:06.560]   every day the basic things of a functional body, of our health, of access to water, which
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:11.840]   so many millions of people around the world do not have reliably,
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:19.600]   is very clarifying and super important. - Yeah, health is a gift. Water is a gift.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:25.600]   Is there a memory with your mom that had a defining effect on your life?
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:33.200]   - I have these vignettes in my mind, seeing her in action in different capacities
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:43.760]   a lot of times in the context of things that I would later go on to do myself. So I would go
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:49.360]   every day, almost every day after school, and I'd go to the Plaza Hotel and I'd follow her around as
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:54.800]   she'd walk the hallways and just observe her. And she was so impossibly glamorous.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:03.600]   She was doing everything in four and a half inch heels with this bouffant. And so it's almost like
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:11.120]   an inaccessible visual. But I think for me, when I saw her experience, the most joy tended to be
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:18.960]   by the sea, almost always, not a pool. And I think I get this from her, "Pools, eh, they're fine."
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:26.720]   I love the ocean. I love salt water. I love the way it makes me feel. And I think I got that from
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:35.520]   her. So we would just swim together all the time. And it's a lot of what I love about Miami,
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:42.400]   actually, being so close to the ocean. I find it to be super cathartic. But a lot of my memories
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:52.080]   of my mom, seeing her really just in her bliss, is floating around in a body of salt water.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.160]   Is there also some aspect to her being an example of somebody that could be
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:02.640]   sort of beautiful and feminine, but at the same time powerful, a successful businesswoman,
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:09.040]   that showed that it's possible to do that? Yeah, I think she really was a trailblazer.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:15.360]   It's not uncommon in real estate for there to be multiple generations of people. And so on
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:23.280]   job sites, it was not unusual for me to run into somebody whose grandfather had worked with my
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:29.760]   grandfather in Brooklyn or Queens, or whose father had worked with my mother. And they'd
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:36.000]   always tell me these stories about her rolling in, and they'd hear the heels first. And a lot
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.840]   of times the story would be like, "Oh, gosh, really? It's two days after Christmas. We thought
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:51.120]   we'd get a reprieve." But she was very exacting. So I have this visual in my mind of her walking
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:56.080]   on rebar on the balls of her feet in these four-inch heels. I'm assuming she actually
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:05.920]   carried flats with her, but I don't know. That's not the visual I have. But I loved the fact that
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:17.200]   she so embodied femininity and glamour and was so comfortable being tough and ambitious and
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   determined and this unbelievable businesswoman and entrepreneur at a time when she was very much
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:31.040]   alone. Even for me in the development world and so many of the different businesses that I've
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:36.960]   been in, there really aren't women outside of sales and of marketing. You don't see as many
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:44.880]   women in the development space, in the construction space, even in the architecture and design space,
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:53.600]   maybe outside of interior design. And she was decades ahead of me. So I love hearing these
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:47:00.560]   stories. I love hearing somebody who's my peer tell me about their grandfather and their father
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:04.000]   and their experience with one of my parents. It's amazing.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.400]   And she did it all in four-inch heels.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:11.280]   And she did it. She used to say, "There's nothing that I can't do better in heels."
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.440]   That's a good one.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.880]   That would be her exact thing. And when I'd complain about wearing something, it was like
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:26.320]   the early '90s. Everything was also uncomfortable, these fabrics and materials. And I would go back
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:34.080]   and forth between being super girly and a total tomboy. But she'd dress me up in these things,
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:38.720]   and I'd be complaining about it. And she'd say, "Ivanka, pain for beauty," which I happen to
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.200]   totally disagree with because I think there's nothing worse than being uncomfortable.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:52.320]   So I haven't accepted or internalized all of this wisdom, so to speak, but it was just funny.
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.960]   She had a very specific point of view.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.240]   And full of good lines, "Pain for beauty."
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:04.000]   It's funny because, I mean, just even in fashion, if something's uncomfortable,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.160]   to me, there's nothing that looks worse than when you see somebody tottering around
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:15.040]   and their heels hurt them, so they're kind of walking oddly. And they're not embodying
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.800]   their confidence in that regard. So I'm kind of the opposite. I start with, "Well,
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:24.400]   I want to be comfortable," and that helps me be confident and in command.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.160]   A foundation for fashion for you is comfort, and on top of that, you build
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.280]   things that are beautiful.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:32.480]   It's not comfort like dowdy. There's that level of comfort, but-
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.240]   Functional comfort.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:39.760]   But I think you have to, for me, I want to feel confident. And you don't feel confident when
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:46.960]   you're pulling at a garment or hobbling on heels that don't fit you properly. And she was never
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:50.720]   doing those things either. So I don't know how she was wearing stuff like that that's like a 40-pound
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:57.760]   feet of dress. And I know this because I have it, and I wore it recently. And I mean, I got
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:03.200]   a workout walking to the elevator. Like, this is a heavy dress. And you know what? It was worth it.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:03.760]   It was great.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.600]   Yeah. She's making it look easy, though.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.400]   But she makes it look very, very easy, so.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.320]   Do you miss her?
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:19.120]   So much. It's unbelievable how dislocating the loss of a parent is. And
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:30.400]   her mother lives with me still, my grandmother, who helped raise us. So that's very special.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.880]   And I can ask her some of the questions that I would have,
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.080]   sorry, I wanted to ask my own mom, but it's hard.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:46.400]   It was beautiful to see. I've gotten a chance to spend time with your family, to see so many
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:51.280]   generations together at the table. There's so much history there.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:50:00.080]   No, she's 97. And until she was around 94, she lived completely on her own. No help,
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:08.080]   no anything, no support. And now she requires really sort of 24-hour care. And
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:14.320]   I feel super grateful that I'm able to give her that, because that's what she did for me.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:21.200]   It's amazing for me to have my children be able to grow up and know her stories, know her recipes,
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:30.000]   Czech dumplings and goulash and kicilice and all the other things she used to make me in
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.200]   my childhood. But she really, she was a major force in my life. My grandmother, she,
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:41.520]   my mom was working. So my grandmother was the person who was always home every day
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:48.240]   when I came back from school. And I remember I used to shower, and it would almost be comical.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:54.880]   I feel like in my memory, and there is no washing machine I've seen on the planet that can actually
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:01.520]   do this, but in my memory, I'd go to shower, and I'd drop something on the bed, and I'd come back
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:06.720]   into the room after my shower, and it was folded, pressed. It was all my grandmother. She's running
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:14.240]   after me, taking care of me. And so it's nice to be able to do that for her. Yeah.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:20.560]   I got from her reading. My grandmother, she would, she devoured books, devoured books.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:28.640]   She loved the more sensational ones. So some of these romance novels, I would pick them up,
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:35.840]   the covers. But she could tell you, she could look at any royal lineage across Europe and tell you
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:43.680]   all the mistresses, all the drama. She loved it. But her face was always buried in a book.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:52.480]   My grandfather, Deddo, he was the athlete. He swam professionally on the national team for
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:57.600]   Czechoslovakia, and he helped train my mom, as I was saying before, in skiing. So he was a great
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:05.120]   athlete. And she was at home, and she would read and cook. And so that's something I remember a
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:08.480]   lot from my childhood, and she would always say, like, "I got reading from her."
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:14.320]   I mean, speaking of drama, I had my English teacher in high school
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.960]   recommend a book for me by D.H. Lawrence. It's supposed to be a classic. She's like,
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:22.240]   "This is a classic you should read. It's called Lady Shadowy Day's Lover."
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:29.760]   And so I've read a lot of classics, but that one is straight up like a romance novel about a wife
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:34.320]   who, like, is cheating with a gardener. And I remember reading this, like, "What?" Like,
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:38.960]   in retrospect, I understand why it's a classic, because it was so scandalous to talk about sex
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:44.160]   in a book a hundred years ago, whatever. In retrospect, do you know why she recommended it?
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:49.920]   I have no... I think maybe she's sending a signal, "Hey, you need to get out more," or something.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:54.000]   I don't know. Maybe she was seeking to inspire you, Lex.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:02.480]   Yeah, exactly. Anyway, I mean, I love that kind of stuff too, but I love all the classics. And
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:09.440]   there's a lot of drama. Human nature, drama is part of it. So what about your dad growing up?
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:15.040]   What did you learn about life from your father? I think my father's sense of humor is sometimes
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:22.880]   underappreciated. So he had an amazing and has an amazing sense of humor. He loved music. I think
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:30.320]   my mom loved music as well, but my father always used to say that in another life he would have
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:37.040]   been a Broadway musical producer, which is hilarious to think about, but he loves music.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.000]   That is funny to think about.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:47.840]   Right? Now he DJs at Mar-a-Lago. So people get a sense of, he loves Andrew Lloyd Webber and all of
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:54.560]   it, Pavarotti, Elton John. I mean, these were the same songs on repeat my whole childhood. So
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:57.040]   I know the playlist.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.280]   Probably Sinatra and all that.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:06.480]   Loves Sinatra, loves Elvis, a lot of the greats. So I think I got a little bit of my love for
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:16.960]   music from him, but my mom shared that as well. I think one of the things in looking back that I
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:25.600]   think I inherited from my father as well is this sort of interest or understanding of the importance
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:32.240]   of asking questions and specifically questions of the right people. And I saw this a lot on job
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:38.720]   sites. So I remember with the old post office building, there was this massive glass-topped
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:46.640]   atrium. So heating and cooling the structure was like a Herculean lift. We had the mechanical
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:54.160]   engineers provide their thoughts on how we could do it efficiently and so that the temperature
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:55:02.960]   never varied. And it was enormously expensive as an undertaking. And I remember one of his
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:08.720]   first times on the site because he had really empowered me with this project and he trusted
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:14.720]   me to execute and to also rope him in when I needed it. But the first time he visits,
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:19.360]   we're walking the hallway and we're talking about how expensive this cooling system would be
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:26.400]   and heating system would be. And he starts stopping and he's asking duct workers as we walk
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:33.120]   what they think of the system that the mechanical engineers designed. First few, fine, you know,
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:37.760]   not great answers. The third guy goes, "Sir, if you want me to be honest with you,
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:44.720]   it's obscenely over-designed. In the circumstance of a 1,000-year storm,
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:51.680]   you will have the exact perfect temperature if there's a massive blizzard or if it's unbearably
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:58.960]   hot. But 99.9% of the time, you'll never need it. And so I think it's just an enormous waste of
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:06.000]   money." And so he kept asking that guy questions and we ended up overhauling the design pretty
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.040]   well into the process of the whole system, saving a lot of money, creating a great system that's
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:17.120]   super functional. And so I learned a lot and that's just one example of countless. That one
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:21.280]   really sticks out in my head because I'm like, "Oh my gosh, we're redesigning the whole system."
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:28.160]   You know, we were actively under construction. But I would see him do that on a lot of different
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:35.680]   issues. He would ask people on the work level what their thoughts were, ideas, concepts, designs.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:46.640]   And there was almost like a Socratic sort of first principles type of way he questioned people,
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:52.800]   trying to get down to sort of trying to reduce complex things to something really fundamental
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:57:00.160]   and simple. So I try to do that myself to the best I can. And I think it's something I very
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:05.520]   much learned from him. Yeah, I've seen great engineers, great leaders do just that. You see,
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:13.440]   you want to do that a lot, which is basically ask questions to push simplification. Can we do
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:19.440]   this simpler? The basic question is like, why are we doing it this way? Can this be done simpler?
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:27.760]   And not taking as an answer that this is how we've always done it. Sort of not allowing yourself,
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:33.120]   like, it doesn't matter that's how it was done. What is the right way to do it? And what is,
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:36.880]   and usually the simpler it is, the more correct the way.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:43.200]   Has to do with cost, has to do with simplicity of production, manufacture, but usually simple
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:43.680]   is best.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:48.560]   And it's oftentimes not the architecture, the engineers. It's, you know, in Elon's case,
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:54.400]   probably the line worker who sees things more clearly. So I think making sure it's not just
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:59.200]   that you're asking good questions, you're asking the right people those same good questions.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:04.880]   That's why like a lot of the Elon companies are really flat in terms of organizational design,
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:14.160]   where anybody in the factory floor can talk directly to Elon. There's not this managerial
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:19.920]   class, this hierarchy where it's travel up and down the hierarchy, which large companies often
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:26.480]   construct this hierarchy of managers where no one manager, if you ask them the question of like,
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.960]   what have you done this week? The answer is like, it's really hard to come up with.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:32.800]   Usually it's going to be a bunch of paperwork.
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:39.280]   So you like, nobody knows what they actually do. So when it's flat, you can actually get as
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:45.200]   quickly as possible. When problems arise, you can solve those problems as quickly as possible.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:52.080]   And also you have a direct, rapid iterative process where you're making things simpler,
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:58.400]   making them more efficient and constantly improving. So yeah, it's interesting when large,
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:03.760]   I mean, you see this in government, a lot of people get together, a hierarchy is developed
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:10.000]   and that somehow, sometimes it's good, but very often just slows things down and you see great
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:18.480]   companies, great, great companies, Apple, Google, Meta, they have to fight against that bureaucracy
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:24.400]   that builds, the slowness that large organizations have. And to still be a big organization,
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:27.920]   act like a startup is the big challenge.
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:34.160]   It's super difficult to deconstruct that as well, once it's in place, right? It's circumventing
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:42.320]   layers and asking questions, probing questions of people on the ground level is a huge challenge to
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:48.960]   the authority of the hierarchy. And there's tremendous amount of resistance to it. So it's
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:56.080]   how do you grow something in the case of a company, in terms of a culture that can scale,
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:05.040]   but doesn't lose its connection to sort of real and meaningful feedback. It's not easy.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:10.240]   I've had a lot of conversations with Jim Keller, who's this legendary engineer and leader.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:17.840]   And he has talked about, you often have to kind of be a little bit of an asshole in the room,
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:24.640]   not in a mean way, but it's uncomfortable. Like a lot of these questions, they're uncomfortable.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:29.760]   They break the kind of general politeness and civility that people have in communication.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:37.440]   When you get a meeting, nobody wants to be like, can we do it way different? Everyone wants just
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:44.480]   like this lunch is coming up. I have this trip planned on the weekend with the family. Everyone
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:50.240]   just wants comfort. When humans get together, they kind of gravitate towards comfort. Nobody
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:56.320]   wants that one person that comes in and says, "Hey, can we do this way better and way different?"
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.000]   And everything we've gotten comfortable with, throw it out.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.880]   Not only do they not want that, but the one person who comes in and does that puts a massive target
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:12.160]   on their back and is ultimately seen as a threat. I mean, nobody really gets fired for maintaining
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.720]   the status quo, even if things go poorly. It's the way it was always done.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:23.440]   Yeah, humans are fascinating. But in order to actually do great big projects,
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:29.680]   to reach for the stars, you have to have those people. You have to constantly disrupt
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.480]   and have those uncomfortable conversations.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.240]   And really have that first principles type of orientation,
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.720]   especially in those large bureaucratic contexts.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:43.360]   So amongst many other things, you created a fashion brand.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.920]   What was that about? What was the origin of that?
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:58.560]   I always loved fashion as a form of self-expression, as a means to communicate either a truth or an
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:04.080]   illusion, depending on what kind of mood you were in. But this sort of second body, if you will.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.440]   So I loved fashion. And look, I mean, my mother was a big part of the reason I did. But
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.080]   I never thought I would go into fashion. In fact, I was graduating from Wharton.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:22.640]   It was the day of my graduation. And Anna Wintour calls me up and offered me a job at Vogue, which
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:29.360]   is a dream in so many ways. But I was so focused. I wanted to go into real estate and I wanted to
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:37.120]   build buildings. And I told her that. So I really thought that that was going to be the path I was
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:45.760]   taking. And then very organically, fashion was part of my life. But it came into my life in a
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:53.920]   more professional capacity by talking with my first of many different partners that I had in
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:03:00.640]   the fashion space about--he actually had shown me a building to buy. His family had some real
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:06.240]   estate holdings. And I passed on the real estate deal, but we forged a friendship. And we started
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:15.440]   talking about how in the space that he was in, fine jewelry, there was this lack of product
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:21.680]   and brands that were positioned for self-purchasing females. So everything was about the man buying
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.760]   the Christmas gift, the man buying the engagement ring. The stores felt like that. They were all
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:32.720]   tailored towards the male aesthetic. The marketing felt like that. And what about the woman who had
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:38.640]   a salary and was really excited to buy herself a great pair of earrings or had just received a
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:43.360]   great bonus and was going to use it to treat herself? So we thought there was a void in the
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:51.040]   marketplace. And that was the first category. I launched Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry. And we just
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.840]   caught lightning in a bottle. It was really quickly after that. I met my partner who had
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:04.240]   founded Nine West Shoes, a really capable partner. And we launched a shoe collection, which took off
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:09.280]   and did enormously well. And then a clothing collection and handbags and sunglasses and
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:21.280]   fragrance. So we caught a moment and we found a positioning for this self-purchasing, multidimensional
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:28.800]   woman. And we made dressing for work aspirational. At the time we launched, if you wanted to buy
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:36.320]   something for an office context, the brands that existed were the opposite of exciting. Nobody was
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:42.720]   taking pictures of what they were wearing to work and posting it online with some of these
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:48.480]   classic legacy brands. Really, it felt very much like it was designed by a team of men for what a
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.480]   woman would want to wear to the office. So we started creating this clothing that was feminine,
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:05:00.560]   that was beautiful, that was versatile, that would take a woman from the boardroom to an afterschool
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:09.200]   soccer game, to a date night with a boyfriend, to a walk in the park with her husband. All the
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:15.840]   different ways women live their lives and creating a wardrobe for that woman who works at every
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:24.000]   aspect of their life, not just sort of the siloed professional part. And it was really compelling.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   We started creating great brand content and we had incredible contributors like Adam Grant,
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:37.440]   who was blogging for us at the time and creating aspirational content for working women.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:43.360]   It was actually kind of a funny story, but I now had probably close to 11 different product
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:48.720]   categories and we were growing like wildfire. And I started to think about what would be a
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:53.360]   compelling way to sort of create interesting content for the people who are buying these
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:59.360]   different categories. And we came up with a website called Women Who Work. And I went to
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:04.160]   a marketing agency, one of the fancy firms in New York, and I said, "We want to create a brand
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:12.000]   campaign around this multidimensional woman who works. And what do you think? Can you help us?"
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.480]   And they come back and they say, "You know, we don't like the word work. We think it should be
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:23.760]   women who do." And I just start laughing because I'm like, "Women who do?" And the fact that they
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:30.080]   couldn't conceive of it being sort of exciting and aspirational and interesting to sort of lean
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:36.800]   into working at all aspects of our lives was just fascinating to me, but showed that that was part
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:43.280]   of the problem. And I think that's why ultimately, I mean, when the business grew to be hundreds of
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:48.960]   millions of dollars in sales, we were distributed at all the best retailers across the country,
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:56.240]   from Neiman Marcus to Sachs to Bloomingdale's and beyond. And I think it really resonated with
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:05.280]   people in an amazing way. And probably not dissimilar to how I have this incredible experience
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:11.680]   every time somebody comes up to me and tells me that they were married in a space that
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:19.600]   I had painstakingly designed. I have that experience now with my fashion company.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:25.040]   The number of women who will come up tell me that they loved my shoes or they loved the handbags.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:30.560]   And I've had women show me their engagement rings. They got engaged with us. And it's really
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:34.560]   rewarding. It's really beautiful. Yeah. When I was hanging out with you in Miami,
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:40.960]   the number of women that came up to you saying that you love the clothing, they love the shoes,
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.960]   is awesome. All these years later. All these years later. Yeah. What does it take to make a
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:51.520]   shoe where somebody would come up to you years later and just be just full of love for this
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:58.000]   thing you've created? What's that mean? What does it take to do that? Well, I still wear the shoes.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.720]   I mean, that's a good starting point, right? Is to create a thing that you want to wear.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:08.320]   I feel like the product, I think first and foremost, you have to have the right partner.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:13.680]   So building a shoe, if you talk to a great shoe designer, it's like it's architecture.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:18.400]   Like making a heel that's four inches that feels good to walk in for eight hours a day,
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:24.720]   that is an engineering feat. And so I found great partners in everything that I did. My
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:30.000]   shoe partner had founded Nine West, so he really knew what went into making a shoe wearable and
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.520]   comfortable. And then you overlay that with great design. And we also created this really
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:45.200]   comfortable, beautifully designed, super feminine product offering that was also affordably priced.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:51.680]   So I think it was like the trifecta of those three things that I think it made it stand out
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.720]   for so many people. Can you speak to, I don't know if it's possible to articulate, but can
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:04.480]   you speak to the process you go through from idea to the final thing? Like what you go through to
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:09.760]   bring an idea to life? So not being a designer, and this was true in real estate as well, I was
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.800]   never the architect. So I didn't necessarily have the pen and in fashion the same. I was kind of
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:21.120]   like a conductor. I knew what I liked and didn't like, and I think that's really important. And
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:27.840]   that became honed for me over time. So I would have to sit a lot longer with something earlier on
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:36.720]   than later when I had more refined my aesthetic point of view. And so I think, first of all,
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:43.920]   you have to have a pretty strong sense of what resonates with you. And then as in the case of
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:50.320]   my fashion business, as it grew and became quite a large business, and I had so many different
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:54.640]   categories, everything had to work together. So I had individual partners for each category.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:59.600]   But if we were selling at Neiman Marcus, we couldn't have a pair of shoes that didn't relate
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:04.640]   to a dress that didn't relate to a pair of sunglasses and handbags all on the same floor.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:12.000]   So in the beginning, it was much more collaborative. As time passed, I really
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.040]   sort of took the point on deciding, and this is the aesthetic for the season. These are the colors
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:22.080]   we're going to use. These are fabrics. And then working with our partners on the execution of
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:30.080]   that, I needed to create an overlay that allowed for cohesion as the collection grew. And that was
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.880]   actually really fun for me because that was a little different. I was typically initially
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:42.000]   responding to things that were put in front of me. And towards the end, it was my partners who
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:49.920]   were responding to the things that myself and my team. But I always wanted to bring the best talent
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:58.880]   in. So I was hiring great designers and printmakers and copywriters. And so I had this
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:06.720]   almost like that conductor analogy. I had this incredible group of, in this case, women
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:14.320]   assembled who had very strong points of view themselves and created a great team.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:20.000]   So yeah, I mean, great team is really sort of essential. It's the essential thing behind
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.920]   any successful story. But there's this thing of taste, which is really interesting because it's
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:32.160]   hard to kind of articulate what it takes. But basically knowing A versus B, what looks good,
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:41.680]   or without A/B comparison to say like, if we changed this part, that would make it better.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:49.920]   That sort of designer taste, it's hard to make explicit what that is. But the great designers
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:56.080]   have that taste, like this is going to look good. And it's not actually, again, the Steve Jobs thing,
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:02.560]   it's not the opinion poll. You can't poll people and ask them what looks better. You have to have
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:09.280]   the vision of that. And as you said, you also have to develop eventually the confidence that your
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:16.480]   taste is good, such that you can curate, you can direct teams, you can argue that, no, no, no,
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.880]   this is right. Even when there's several people that say, this doesn't make any sense. If you
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.760]   have that vision, have the confidence, this will look good. That's how you come up with great
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:30.800]   designs. It's a mixture of great taste as you develop over time and the confidence.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:37.760]   And that's a really hard thing, especially, I think one of the things that I love most about
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:43.680]   all of these creative pursuits is that ability to work with the best people. Right now, I'm
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:49.520]   working with my husband. We have this 1,400-acre island in the Mediterranean,
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:54.880]   and we're bringing in the best architects and the best brands. But to have a point of view
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:02.480]   and to challenge people who are such artists respectfully, but not to be afraid to ask
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:08.080]   questions, it takes a lot of confidence to do that. And it's hard. So, these are actually just
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:13.600]   internal early renderings. So, we're in the process of doing the master planning now.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.520]   But this is beautiful. I mean, it's a side of Amman.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:20.560]   Yeah, this is an early vision. Yeah. It's going to be extraordinary. Amman's going to
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:26.400]   operate the hotel for us, and there are going to be villas, and we have Carbone,
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:32.320]   who's going to be doing the food and beverage. But it's amazing to bring together all of this
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:37.040]   talent. And for me to be able to play around and flex the real estate muscles again and have
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:41.520]   some fun with it is... The real estate, the design, the art. How hard is it to bring something like
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:48.640]   that to life? Because that looks surreal out of this world. Well, especially on an island.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:54.720]   It's challenging, meaning the logistics of even getting the building materials to an island are
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:02.320]   no joke, but we will execute on it. And it may not be this. This is sort of, as I said,
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:07.680]   early conceptual drawings, but it gives a sense of sort of wanting to honor the topography that
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:14.560]   exists. And this is obviously very modern, but making it feel right in terms of the context of
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:25.040]   the vegetation and the terrain that exists and not just have a beautiful glass box. Obviously,
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:32.240]   you want glass. You want to look out and see that gorgeous blue ocean, but how do you do that in a
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:38.400]   way that doesn't feel generic and isn't a squandered opportunity to create something new?
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:42.560]   Yeah, and it's integrated with the natural landscape. It's a celebration of the natural
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.280]   landscape around it. So, I guess you start from this dream-like, because this feels like a dream,
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:50.800]   and then when you're faced with the reality of the building materials and all the actual
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:56.720]   constraints of the building, then it evolves from there, right? Yeah, and so much of architecture
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:05.200]   you don't see, but it's decisions made. So, how do you create independent structures where you
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:11.040]   look out of one and don't see the other? You know, how do you ensure the sort of the stacking
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:17.440]   and the master plan works in a way that's harmonious and view corridors and all of
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:23.680]   those elements, all of those components of decision-making are super appreciated,
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:26.400]   but not often thought about. What's a view corridor?
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:31.760]   Like to make sure that the top unit, you're not looking out and seeing a whole bunch of
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:35.840]   units. You're looking out and seeing the ocean. So, that's where you take this and then you start
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:40.800]   angling everything, and you start thinking about, well, in this context, do we have green roofs? So,
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:46.560]   if there's any hint of a roof, it's camouflaged by vegetation that matches what already exists
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:51.840]   on the island. That's where the engineers become very important. How do you build into a mountainside
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:59.120]   while being sensitive to the beauty of the island? It's almost like a mathematical problem. I took a
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:05.040]   class, computational geometry, in grad school, where you have to think about these view corridors.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:10.000]   It's like a math problem. Well, but it's also an art problem because it's not just about making
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.920]   sure that there's no occlusions to the view. You have to figure out when there is occlusions,
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:22.160]   like what, is it vegetation? You have to figure all that out. So, every single room,
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:25.920]   every single building is a thing that adds extra complexity.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:30.240]   And then the choices, like how does the Sun rise and set?
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.880]   So, how do you want to angle the hotel in relation-
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:35.440]   That's awesome.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:39.680]   -to the Sun rise and the Sun set? You obviously want people to experience those.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:48.960]   So, which do you favor? The directionality of the wind. And on an island, and in this case,
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:54.160]   the wind is coming from the north, and the vegetation is less lush on the northern end.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:59.760]   So, do you focus more on the southern end and have the horseback riding trails and amenities
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:05.760]   up towards the north? So, there are these really interesting decisions and choices
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.280]   you get to reflect on.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:11.520]   That's a fascinating sort of discussion to be having. And probably there's actual constraints
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.400]   on infrastructure issues. So, all of those constraints-
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.440]   Yeah, well, the grade of the land, right? If it's super steep.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.720]   So, also finding the areas of topography that are flatter, but still have the great views.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:28.240]   So, it's fun. I think real estate and building, it's like a giant puzzle. And I love puzzles.
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.480]   Every piece relates to another, and it's all sort of interconnected.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:36.400]   Yeah, like you said, in the whole post office, every single room is different,
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.800]   so every single room is a puzzle when you're doing the renovation.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.480]   That's fascinating.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:50.400]   And if you're not thoughtful, it's like, at best, really quirky. At worst, completely ridiculous.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.680]   Quirky is such a funny word.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:59.040]   I'm sure you've walked into your fair share of quirky rooms. And sometimes that's charming,
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:05.600]   but most often it's charming when it's intentional through smart design.
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:09.680]   Yeah, you can tell if it's by accident or if it's intentional. You can tell.
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.800]   So much, I mean, the whole hospitality thing, it's not just like how it's designed, it's how,
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:20.080]   once the thing is operating, if it's a hotel, how everything comes together.
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.160]   The culture of the place.
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.120]   And the warmth.
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:23.440]   Yeah.
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:32.560]   Like, I think with spaces, you can feel the soul of a structure. And I think on the hotel side,
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:37.920]   you have to think about flow of traffic, use, all these things. When you're building condominiums
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:43.280]   or your own home, you want to think about the warmth of a space as well. And especially with
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:48.320]   super modern designs, sometimes warmth is sacrificed. And I think there is a way to
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:55.520]   sort of marry both. And that's where you get into sort of the interior design elements and disciplines
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:03.440]   and how fabrics can create tremendous warmth in a space which is otherwise sort of colder,
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:09.760]   raw building materials. And that's a really interesting, like how texture matters, how color
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:20.800]   matters. And I think oftentimes interior design is not, it doesn't take the same priority.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:29.920]   And I think that underestimates the impact it can have on how you experience a room or a space.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:33.680]   Yeah. Especially when it's working together with the architecture.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.400]   Yeah. Fabrics and color. That's so interesting.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.640]   Finishes. You know, the choice of wood.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:41.520]   That's making me feel horrible about the space we're sitting in.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:46.080]   It's like black curtains, the warmth. I need to work on this.
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.200]   No comment.
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:54.400]   This is a big to-do item. You're making me feel, I'll listen back to this over and over.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.560]   There may be like a woman's touch needed.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.360]   A lot. A lot.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:00.000]   But I actually, I appreciate the vegetation.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.080]   Yeah. It's fake plants.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:08.080]   You know what I love about this space though is it's, is like you come through. Like every single
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:13.440]   element, there's a story behind it. So it's not just some, you didn't have some interior
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:18.400]   designer curate your bookshelf. You know, there's like nobody came in here with books by the yard.
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:23.760]   This is basically an Ikea. Like this is not, this is not deeply thought through,
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.640]   but it does bring me joy.
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:27.140]   Yeah.
[01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:34.240]   Which is one way to do design. As long as you're happy, that usually means if your taste is decent
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:41.360]   enough, that means others will be happy or we'll see the joy radiate through it. But I appreciate
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.600]   you were grasping for compliments and you eventually got that.
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:48.160]   No, I actually, I love it. I love it. You have like a little, I love this guy.
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:55.760]   Yeah. You're holding on to a monkey looking at a human skull, which is particularly irrelevant.
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:00.080]   And this, I mean, I feel like you've really thought about all of these.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:05.360]   Yeah. There's robot, I don't know if, I mean, I don't know how much you looked into robots,
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.760]   but there's, there's a way to communicate love and affection from a robot that I'm
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:15.120]   really fascinated by. And a lot of cartoonists do this too. You have to, when you create cartoons
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:23.440]   and non-human-like entities, you have to bring out the joy. So with WALL-E or robots in Star Wars,
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:29.920]   to be able to communicate emotion to anger and excitement through a robot is really
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:36.320]   interesting to me. And people that do it successfully are awesome, are awesome.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.200]   To make you smile.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:40.400]   Yeah. That makes you smile for sure. There's a longing there.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:45.680]   How do you do that successfully as you, as you bring them, your projects to life?
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:50.080]   I think there's, there's so many detailed elements that I think artists know well.
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:58.720]   But one basic one is something that people know, and you now know, because you have a dog,
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:06.880]   is the excitement that a dog has when it, when you first show up, just the recognizing you and like
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:13.920]   catching your eye and just showing his excitement by wiggling his butt and tail and all this kind of,
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:20.800]   this, this intense joy that overtakes his body, that, that moment of recognizing something.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:28.480]   It's the double take that you're, that moment of like, where this joy of recognition takes
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:34.400]   over your whole cognition and you're just like, there, and there's a connection. And then the
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:38.960]   other person gets excited and you both get excited together. It's kind of like that feeling,
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:43.520]   what would I put it? You know, like when you go to airports and you get to see people
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:49.040]   who haven't seen each other for a long time, all of a sudden recognize each other in their meeting,
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:55.040]   and they're all like, run towards each other and hug, that moment. But that's awesome to watch.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.000]   There's so much joy.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.920]   And, and dogs that will have that every time. You could walk into the other room to get a glass of
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:06.080]   milk and you come back and your dog sees you like it's the first time.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:11.280]   So I love replicating that in robots. They actually say children, like one of the reasons
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:18.560]   why peekaboo is so successful is that they actually don't remember not having seen you
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:24.080]   a few seconds prior. There's a, there's a term for it, but I remember as a, when,
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:28.400]   when my kids were younger, you leave the room and you walk back in 30 seconds later and they
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:37.040]   experienced the same joy as if you had been, you know, gone for four hours. And we grew out of that.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.800]   We become very used to one another.
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:44.400]   I kind of want to forever be excited by the peekaboo phenomena. The simple joys. We were
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:49.440]   talking about on fashion, having the confidence of taste to be able to sort of push through on
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:55.120]   this idea of design. But you've also mentioned somebody who admires Rick Rubin in his book,
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:02.000]   The Creative Act. It has some really interesting ideas. And one of them is to accept
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.680]   self-doubt and imperfection. So is there some battle within yourself that you have on sort of
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:17.040]   striving for perfection and for the confidence and always kind of having it together versus
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.840]   like accepting that things are always going to be imperfect?
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:26.240]   I think every day. I think I wake up in the morning and, you know, I want to be better.
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:32.160]   I want to be a better mom. I want to be a better wife. I want to be more creative. I want to be
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:40.800]   physically stronger. And, and so that very much lives within me all the time. You know, I think I,
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:49.200]   I also grew up in the context of being the child of two extraordinarily successful parents. And
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:55.280]   that could have been debilitating for me. And I saw that in a lot of my friends who grew up in
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:25:04.160]   circumstances similar to that. They were afraid to try for fear of not measuring up. And I think
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:12.560]   somehow early on, I learned to kind of harness the fear of not being good enough, not being
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:23.040]   competent enough. And I harnessed it to make me better and to push me outside of my comfort zone.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:28.320]   So I think that's always lived with me. And I think it probably always will. I think
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:35.280]   you have to have humility in anything you do that you could be better and strive for that.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:42.960]   I think as you get older, it softens a little bit as you have more reps, you know, as you have more
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:51.440]   examples of, of having been thrown in the deep end and figured out how to swim, you, you get a
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:26:01.920]   little bit more comfortable in your sort of abstract competency. But if that fear is not in you,
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:09.360]   I think you're not challenging yourself enough. Harness the fear. The other thing he writes about
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:17.760]   is intuition. That you need to trust your instincts and intuition. That's a very recruitment
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:25.840]   thing to say. But so what percent of your decision making is intuition and what percent is through
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:32.080]   rigorous, careful analysis? Would you say? I think it's both. It's like trust but verify,
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:39.680]   you know. I think you, I think that's also where age and experience comes into play because
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:46.240]   I think you always have sort of a gut instinct. But I think intuition, like well-honed intuition,
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:53.200]   comes from a place of, of accumulated knowledge, right? So oftentimes when you feel really
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:57.760]   strongly about something, it's because you've sort of, you've been there. Like you know what's right.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:06.560]   Or on a personal level, if you're acting in accordance with your core values, you know,
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:12.800]   it just feels good. And even if it would be the right decision for others, if you're acting outside
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:19.200]   of, of, of your sort of integrity or core values, it doesn't feel good. And, and it, you know,
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:25.280]   your intuition will signal that to you. You'll never be, you'll never be comfortable. So I think
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:32.800]   because, because of that, I, I start oftentimes with my intuition and then I, and then I put it
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:41.040]   through like a rigorous test of, of whether that is in fact true. But very seldom do I go against
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:46.080]   what my initial instinct was, not, at least at this point in my life. Yeah, I had actually a
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:53.360]   discussion yesterday with a big-time business owner investor who, who's talking about being
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:59.200]   impulsive and following that, like on a phone call, shifting like the entire, everything,
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:04.960]   like giving away a very large amounts of money and moving it in another direction on an impulse,
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:10.480]   making a promise that he can't at that time deliver, but knows if he works hard,
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:16.720]   he'll deliver and all doing just to be following that impulsive feeling. And he said, now that,
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:21.440]   you know, he has, he has a family that probably some of that impulse has quieted down a little
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:27.520]   bit. He's more rational and thoughtful and so on, but wonders whether it's sometimes good
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:34.880]   to just be impulsive and to just trust your gut and just go with it. Don't deliberate too long
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:40.160]   because then you won't, you won't do it. It's interesting. It's the confidence, the stupidity
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:47.120]   maybe of youth that leads to some of the greatest breakthroughs. And it's like, there's a cost to
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:53.440]   wisdom and deliberation. There, there is, but I actually think in this case, as you get older,
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:29:01.440]   you may act less impulsively, but I think you're more like attuned with, you have more experience.
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:07.120]   So your, your gut is like more well honed, you know, so your instincts are more well honed. I
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:15.920]   think I, I found that to be true for me. You know, it doesn't feel as like reckless as when I was
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:24.400]   younger. Amongst many other things, you were on The Apprentice. People love you on there. People
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:31.120]   love the show. So what did you learn about business, about life from the various contestants
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:36.320]   on there? Well, I think you can learn everything about life from Joe Rivers. So I'm just, I'm
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:45.680]   got it. Amazing. But you know, I, it was, it was such a wild experience for me because I was,
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:50.720]   I was quite young when I was on it, just getting started in business. And it was the number one
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:56.400]   television show in the country. And it went on to be syndicated all over the world. And it was just
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:04.320]   this wild, like phenomenal success. You know, a business show had never, had never crossed over
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:11.040]   in this sort of way. So it was really a moment in time. And you had regular Apprentice and then
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:16.080]   the Celebrity Apprentice, but, but the tasks, I mean, they, they went on to be studied at business
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:21.200]   schools across the country. So every other week I'd be reading case studies of how The Apprentice
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:27.440]   was being examined and taught to classes and this university in Boston or, you know, so it was
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:33.120]   extraordinary. And this was like a real life classroom I was in. So I think because of the
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:38.640]   nature of the show, you learn a lot about, you know, teamwork and you're watching it and analyzing
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:45.120]   it real time. You learned a lot about, a lot of the tasks were very marketing oriented because of,
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:53.120]   you know, the short duration of time they had to, to execute. A lot of, you learned a lot about time
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:59.600]   management because of that short duration. So, you know, almost every episode would devolve into
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:05.840]   people hysterical over the fact that they had 10 minutes left to, with this Herculean lift ahead
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:11.760]   of them. So, so it was, it was a fascinating, it was a fascinating experience for me. And,
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:17.520]   and we would be filming, I mean, we would film first thing in the morning at like 5 or 6 a.m.
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:25.120]   in Trump Tower oftentimes, like in the lobby of Trump Tower, that's where the war rooms and board
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:31.840]   rooms of the candidates were, the contestants were. And then we would go up in the elevator
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:36.960]   to our office. We would work all day and then we'd come down and we'd evaluate the tasks. It
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:44.240]   was this weird, like real life television thing experience in the middle of our, sort of on the
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:50.640]   bookends of our work day. So it was, it was intense. So you're, you're like curating the
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:55.440]   television version of it and also living it. Living the, and oftentimes there was like an
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:02.880]   overlay. Like there were episodes that they came up with brand campaigns for my shoe collection
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:10.080]   or my clothing line or, or design challenges related to, you know, a hotel I was responsible
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:16.320]   for, for building. So there was this unbelievable crossover that was obviously great for us from a
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:22.800]   business perspective, but it's sometimes surreal to, to experience. What was it like? Was it,
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:26.000]   was it scary to be in front of a camera when you know so many people
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:32.400]   watch? I mean, that, that's a new experience for you at that time. Just the number of people
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:40.480]   watching. Yeah. Was that weird? It was really weird. I, I really struggled
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:49.200]   watching myself on the episodes. Like I really, I still to this day, like television as a medium,
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:53.920]   like the fact that we're taping this, I'm more self-conscious than if we weren't. I, I just,
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:33:02.880]   it's... Hey, I have to watch myself as after, after we record this, before I publish it,
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:09.360]   I have to listen to my stupid self talk. So, and... So you're saying it doesn't get better.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:14.160]   It doesn't get better. I, I still, I hear myself, I'm like, does my voice really sound like that?
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:21.760]   You know, why do I do this thing or that thing? And I, I find it, some people are super at ease
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:26.960]   and, and who knows, maybe they're not either, but some people feel like there's, you know,
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:34.720]   my father was, I think like who you, who you saw is who you get. And I think that made him so
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:41.360]   effective, um, in that medium, uh, because he was just himself and he was totally unselfconscious.
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:49.920]   I was not, I was totally self-conscious. So it was, uh, it was extraordinary, but, um,
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:53.200]   but also a little challenging for me. I think certain people are just like
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:59.120]   born to be entertainers, like Elvis, like on stage, they come to life. Yeah. This is where they,
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:03.920]   this is where they're truly happy. I've met, I've met guys like that, like great rock stars. Like,
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:09.840]   this is where they, they feel like they belong on stages. It's not just the thing they do and
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:13.600]   they, there's certain aspects they love, certain aspects they don't know. This is where, this is
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.000]   where they're alive. This is where they, they've always dreamed of being. This is where they want
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.800]   to be forever. Michael Jackson was like that. Michael Jackson. I saw pictures of you hanging
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:27.760]   out with Michael Jackson. That was cool. He came once to a performance. I wanted to be,
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:35.680]   one moment in time, I wanted to be a professional ballerina. Okay. Yes. Um, and I was, you know,
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:39.520]   working really hard. I was going to the school of American ballet. I was dancing at the Lincoln
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:45.440]   Center in the Nutcracker. I was super serious, you know, nine, 10 year old. And, um, and my
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:51.520]   parents came to a Christmas performance of the Nutcracker and my father brought Michael Jackson
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:58.400]   with him. And everyone was so excited that all the dancers, they wore one glove, but I remember
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:08.640]   he was so shy. He was so quiet. Um, and when you'd see him, uh, like in, in smaller group settings,
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:15.600]   and then you'd watch him walk onto stage and it was like a completely different person,
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:22.240]   like the vitality that came into him. And you say, that's like someone who was born to do what he
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:28.720]   did. And, and I think there are a lot of performers like that. And I just, in general, love to see
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:36.800]   people that have found the thing that, uh, makes them come alive. Like I, um, as I mentioned,
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:42.800]   went to the jungle recently with, uh, Paul Roselye and he's a guy who just belongs in the jungle.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:48.560]   Yeah. Like that's the guy where, like when I, I got a chance to go with him from the city to
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:55.680]   the jungle and you just see this person change of the happiness, the, the, the joy he has when he
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:02.560]   first is able to jump in the water, the Amazon river, and to feel like he's home with the
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:07.680]   crocodiles and all that with what he's calling friends and probably dances around in the trees
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:13.120]   with the monkeys. So he, like he, this is, this is where he belongs. And I love seeing that.
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:17.120]   You felt that. I mean, I, I watched the interview you did with him and,
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:23.600]   and he felt that like you, uh, his passion and enthusiasm, like it
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:30.240]   radiated and captive. I mean, I'm, I love animals. Like I love all animals, never loved snakes so
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:36.560]   much. And he almost made me, now I appreciate the beauty of them much more than I did, um, prior to
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:42.160]   listening to him speak about them. But it, it's an infectious thing. He actually, we were talking
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:47.600]   about skyscrapers before I loved, he called trees skyscrapers of life. And I thought that was so
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:54.720]   great. Yeah. And they are, they're so big. I mean, just like skyscrapers or large buildings,
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:01.280]   they also represent a history, especially in Europe. I like to think, look at all these
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:05.840]   ancient buildings. You like to think of all the people throughout history that have looked at
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:12.240]   them, have admired them, have been inspired by them. You know, the great leaders of history
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:17.360]   in France, it's like Napoleon, just the history that's contained within a building. You almost
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:22.800]   feel the energy of that history. You could feel the stories emanate from the buildings. And that
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:29.920]   same way, when you look at giant trees that have been there, uh, for, for decades, for centuries,
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:35.920]   in some cases, you, you feel the history, the stories emanate. I got a chance to climb some
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:41.520]   of them. So you feel like there's a visceral feeling of the power of the trees. It's cool.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:46.400]   Yeah. That's an experience I'd love to have, be that disconnected.
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:51.760]   Yeah. Being in the jungle, uh, among the trees, among the animals,
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:56.080]   you remember that you're forever a part of nature. You're, you're fundamentally our nature,
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:03.600]   that this is a, uh, earth is a living organism and you're a part of that organism. And that's
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:08.800]   humbling. That's beautiful. And you get to experience that in a real, real way. It sounds
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:13.200]   simple to say, but when you actually like experience it, it stays with you for a long time.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:18.640]   Especially if you're out there alone, like I got a chance to spend time in the jungle solo,
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:28.000]   just by myself. And you sit in the fear of that, in the simplicity of that, all of it. And just
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:36.960]   no sounds of humans anywhere. You're just sitting there and listening to, uh, all the monkeys and
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:42.320]   the birds trying to have sex with each other all around you, just screaming. And there's like
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:46.880]   romantic, I mean, I romanticize everything. There's like birds that are monogamous for life,
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:51.120]   like macaws. You can see like two of them flying. They're also, by the way,
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:55.760]   screaming at each other. I always wonder, like, are they arguing or is this their love language?
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:56.560]   That's very funny.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:00.480]   You just have these like two birds that you know have been together for a long time and they're
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:03.680]   just screaming at each other in the morning. That's really funny because there aren't that
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:08.480]   many animal species that are monogamous. And you highlighted one example where they literally sound
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:10.240]   like they're bickering.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:15.360]   But maybe to them it's beautiful. You know, I don't want to judge, but they do sound very loud
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:21.520]   and very obnoxious. But amidst all of that, it's just, I don't know.
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:28.720]   I think it's so humbling to like feel so small too. Like I feel like when we get busy and when
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:35.840]   we're running around, it's easy to feel we're so in our head and we feel sort of so consequential,
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:40.160]   like in the context of even our own lives. And then you find yourself in a situation like that.
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:49.520]   I think you feel so much more connected knowing how minuscule you are in the broader sense. And
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:56.960]   I feel that way when I'm on the ocean on a surfboard. You know, it's really humbling to be
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:08.640]   so small amidst that vast sea. And it feels really beautiful with no noise, no chatter,
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:15.200]   no distractions, just being in the moment. And it sounds like you experience that in a
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:18.400]   very, very real way in the Amazon.
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:22.160]   Yeah, the power of the waves is cool. I love swimming out into the ocean and feeling the
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:25.680]   power of the ocean beneath you. You're just like this speck.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:30.480]   And you can't fight it, right? You just have to sort of be in it. And I think in surfing,
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.960]   one of the things I love about it is I feel like a lot of water sports are like manipulating
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:40.720]   the environment, you know. And there's something that can be a little like violent about it. Like
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:46.480]   you look at windsurfing and whereas with surfing, you're like in harmony with it. So,
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:53.760]   you're not fighting it, you're flowing with it. And you still have like the agency of choosing
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:41:00.320]   which waves you're going to surf. And you sit there and you read the ocean and you learn to
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:08.800]   understand it, but you can't control it. What's it like to like fall on your face
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:16.160]   when you're trying to surf? I haven't surfed before. It just feels like I always see videos
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:19.520]   of when everything goes great. I just wonder like when it doesn't.
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:25.040]   Those are the ones people post. Well, I actually had the unique experience of one of my first
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:29.680]   time surfing. I only learned a couple of years ago, so I'm not good. I just love it. I love
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:34.560]   everything about it. I love the physicality. I love being in the ocean. I love everything
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:40.080]   about it. The hardest thing with surfing is paddling out because when you're like committing,
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:44.880]   you catch a wave. Obviously, sometimes like you flip over your board and that doesn't feel great.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:50.240]   But when you're in sort of the line of impact and you've maybe surfed a good wave in and now
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:54.160]   you're going out for another set and you get sort of stuck in that impact line,
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:59.920]   there's like nothing you can do. You just sort of sit there and you try to dive underneath it
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:07.040]   and it will pound you and pound you. So I've been stuck there while four, five, six waves just like
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:15.280]   crash on top of your head. And the worst thing you can do is get reactive and scared and try
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:20.480]   and fight against it. You kind of just have to flow with it until inevitably there's a break
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:27.280]   and then paddle like hell back out to the line or to the beach, whatever you're feeling. But to me,
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:35.200]   that's the hardest part, the paddling out. How did life change when your father decided
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:46.320]   to run for president? Wow, everything changed. Almost overnight, we learned that he was planning
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:55.600]   to announce his candidacy two weeks before he actually did. And nothing about our lives had
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:04.080]   been constructed with politics in mind. Most often when people are exposed to politics at that level,
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:14.080]   that sort of national level, there's first like city council run and then maybe a state-level run
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:22.160]   and maybe, maybe, you know, Congress, Senator, ultimately the presidency. So it was unheard of
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:29.360]   for him never to have run a campaign and then run for president and win. So it was
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:37.520]   an extraordinary experience. There was so much intensity and so much scrutiny
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:46.560]   and so much noise. So that took, for sure, like a moment to acclimate to. Not sure I ever fully
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:44:00.160]   acclimated, but it definitely was a super unusual experience. But I think then the process that
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:07.040]   unfolded over the next couple of years was also like the most extraordinary growth experience of
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:12.320]   my life. You know, suddenly I was going into communities that I probably never would have been
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:22.160]   to. And I was talking with people who in 30 seconds would reveal to me their deepest insecurity,
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:28.560]   their gravest fear, their wildest ambitions, all of it, with the hope that in telling me that story,
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:35.920]   it would get back to a potential future president of the United States and have impacts for their
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:41.360]   family, for their community. So the level of candor and vulnerability people have with you
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:49.200]   is unlike anything I've ever experienced. And I had done The Apprentice before. People may know
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:55.280]   who I was in some of these situations that I was going into, but they wouldn't have shared with me
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.080]   these things that you got the impression that oftentimes their own spouses wouldn't know,
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:09.200]   and they wouldn't do so within 30 seconds. So you learn so much about what motivates people,
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:16.640]   what drives people, what their concerns are, and you grow so much as a result of it.
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:23.120]   So when you're in the White House, people, unlike in any other position, people have a sense that
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:27.840]   all the troubles they're going through, maybe you can help.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:28.400]   Yeah.
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:29.760]   So they put it all out there.
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:41.200]   And they do so in such a raw, vulnerable, and real way. It's shocking and eye-opening and
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:49.440]   super motivating. I remember once I was in New Hampshire, and early on, right after my father
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:57.680]   had announced his candidacy, and a man walks up to me in the greeting line, and within
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:02.800]   around five seconds, he had started to tell me a story about how his daughter had died of an
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:11.040]   overdose and how he was worried his son was also addicted to opioids. His daughter's friends,
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:19.200]   his son's friends, and it's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking, and it's something that I would
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:22.240]   experience every day in talking with people.
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:23.840]   And those stories just stay with you.
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:24.340]   Always.
[01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:34.560]   You know, I took a long road trip around the United States in my 20s, and I'm kind of thinking
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:41.440]   of doing it again, just for like a couple of months, for that exact purpose. And you can get
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:47.600]   these stories when you go to like a bar in the middle of nowhere and just sit and talk to people,
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:52.880]   and they start sharing. And it reminds you of like how beautiful the country is. It reminds
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:58.480]   you of several things. One, that people, well, it shows you that there's a lot of different accents,
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:03.760]   that's one. But aside from that, that people are struggling with all the same stuff.
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:10.160]   And at least at that time, I wonder what it is now, but at that time, I don't remember,
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:16.400]   on the surface there's like political divisions, there's Republicans and Democrats and so on,
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:22.400]   but like underneath it, there are people who are all the same, the concerns are all the same,
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:28.560]   there's not that much of a division. Right now, the surface division has been amplified even more,
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:33.760]   maybe because of social media, I don't know why. So I would love to see what the country is like
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:40.640]   now, but I suspect probably it's still not as divided as it appears to be on the surface,
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:46.880]   what the media shows, what the social media shows. But what did you experience in terms of the
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:52.240]   division? I think a couple reactions to what you just said. I think the first is,
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:48:03.120]   when you connect with people like that, you are so inspired by their courage in the face of
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:10.800]   adversity and their resilience. And it's like a truly remarkable experience for me. The campaign
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:16.880]   lifted me out of a bubble I didn't even know I was in. I grew up on the Upper East Side of New
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:23.760]   York and I felt like I was well-traveled and well-educated, and I believed at the time that
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:32.080]   I'd been exposed to divergent viewpoints. And I realized during the campaign how limited my
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:38.240]   exposure had been relative to what it was becoming. So there was a lot of growth in that as
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:45.920]   well. But I do think, you think about the vitriol in politics and whether it's worse than it's been
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:52.880]   in the past or not. I think that's up for debate. I think there have been duels and there's been
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:49:00.480]   screaming. And politics has always been a bloodsport, and it's always been incredibly
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:05.200]   vicious. I think in the toxic swirl of social media, it's more amplified and
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:12.000]   there's more sort of democratization around participating in it perhaps.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:18.640]   And it seems like the voices are louder, but it feels like it's always been that.
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:28.080]   But I don't believe most people are like that. And you meet people along the way,
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:34.720]   and they're not leading with what their politics are. They're telling you about their hopes for
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:42.560]   themselves and their communities. And it makes you feel that we are a whole lot less divided than
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:50.480]   the media and others would have us believe. Although I have to say, having duels sounds
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:55.360]   pretty cool. Maybe I just romanticize Westerns, but anyway. All right. I miss Clint Eastwood movies.
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:02.240]   Okay. But it's true. You read some of the stuff in terms of what politics used to be in the history
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:07.680]   of the United States. Those folks went pretty rough, like way rougher actually, but they didn't
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:14.080]   have social media, so they had to go real hard. And the media was rough too. So all the fake news,
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:21.520]   all of that, that's not recent. It's been nonstop. I look at the surface division, the surface
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:26.560]   bickering, and that might be just a feature of democracy. It's not a bug of democracy. It's a
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:35.200]   feature. We're in a constant conflict, and it's the way we try to figure out the right way forward.
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:39.440]   So in the moment, it feels like people are just tearing each other apart, but really,
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:44.240]   we're trying to find the way where in the long arc of history, it will look like progress.
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:50.160]   But in the short term, it just sounds like people making stories up about each other and calling
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:56.240]   each other names and all this kind of stuff. But there's a purpose to it. I mean, that's what
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:51:00.240]   freedom looks like, I guess is what I'm trying to say, and it's better than the alternative.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:04.000]   Well, I think that the vast majority of people aren't participating in it.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.680]   Sure. Yes, that's true also.
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:10.400]   I think there's a minority of people that are doing most of the yelling and screaming,
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:15.040]   and the majority of Americans just want to send their kid to a great school
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:24.720]   and want their communities to thrive and want to be able to realize their dreams and aspirations.
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:33.360]   So I saw a lot more of that than it would feel obvious if you looked at a Twitter feed.
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:39.760]   What went into your decision to join the White House as an advisor?
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:49.760]   You know, the campaign, I never thought about joining. It was kind of like get to the end of
[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:55.520]   it. And when it started, everything in my life was almost firing on all cylinders. I had two young
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:52:04.000]   kids at home. During the course of the campaign, I was pregnant with my third. So this young family,
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:10.880]   my businesses, real estate and fashion, and working alongside my brothers, running the Trump
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:21.040]   hotel collection. My life was full and busy. And so there was a big part of me that just wanted to
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:29.600]   get through it without really thinking forward to what the implications were for me. But when my
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:38.560]   father won, he asked Jared and I to join him. And in asking that question, keep in mind, he was a
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:44.880]   total outsider. So there was no bench of people as he would have today. He had never spent the
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:51.520]   night in Washington, D.C. before staying in the White House. And so when he asked us to join him,
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:59.360]   he trusted us. He trusted in our ability to execute. And there wasn't a part of me that
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:07.760]   could imagine the 70- or 80-year-old version of myself looking back and having been okay
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:14.240]   with having said no and going back to my life as I knew it before. I mean, in retrospect,
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:22.480]   I realize there is no life as you know it before, but just the idea of not saying yes
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:34.560]   wherever that would lead me. And so I dove in. During the course of the campaign,
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:42.240]   I was just much more sensitive to the problems and experiences of Americans. I gave you an example
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:50.080]   before of the father in New Hampshire. But even just in my consumption of information, I had a
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:57.120]   business that was predominantly young women, many of which were thinking about having a kid, had
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:04.400]   just had a child, were planning on that life event. And I knew what they needed to be able to
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:10.000]   show up every day and realize this dream for themselves and the support structures they would
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:17.760]   need to have in place. And I remember reading this article at the time in one of the major newspapers
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:27.120]   of a woman. She had had a very solid job working at one of the blue-chip accounting firms,
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:33.600]   and the recession came. She lost her job around the same time as her partner left her, and over
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:41.040]   a matter of months, she lost her home. So she wound up with her two young kids after bouncing around
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:52.320]   between neighbors living in their car. She gets a call back from one of the many interviews she
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:57.680]   had done for a second interview, where she was all but guaranteed the job, should that go well.
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:04.480]   And she had arranged child care for her two young children with a neighbor in her old apartment
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:09.760]   block. And the morning of the interview, she shows up, and the neighbor doesn't answer the doorbell.
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:18.560]   And she stands there five, ten minutes, doesn't answer. So she has a choice. Does she go to the
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:24.640]   interview with her children, or does she try to cancel? She gets in her car, drives to the
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:30.480]   interview, leaves her two children in the back seat of the car with the window cracked, goes
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:34.720]   into the interview, and gets pulled out of the interview by police because somebody had called
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:39.600]   the cops after seeing her children in the back seat of the car. She gets thrown in jail. Her
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:46.480]   kids get taken from her. And she spends years fighting to regain custody. And I think about--
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:51.520]   that's an extreme example. But I think about something like that, and I say, "If I was the
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:56:02.320]   mother and we were homeless, would I have gone to that interview?" And I probably would have.
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:10.000]   And that is not an acceptable situation. So you hear stories like that, and
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:17.600]   then you get asked, "Will you come with me?" And it's really hard to say no. I spent four
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:23.200]   years in Washington. I feel like I left it all in the field. I feel really good about it, and
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:29.200]   I feel really privileged to have been able to do what I did.
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:39.440]   A chance to help many people. Saying no means you're kind of turning away from those people.
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:40.480]   It felt like that to me.
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:47.920]   Yeah. Yeah, but then it's the turmoil of politics that you're getting into, and
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:56.080]   it really is a leap into the abyss. What was it like trying to get stuff done?
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:06.720]   In Washington, in this place where politics is a game, it feels that way, maybe from an outsider
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:11.200]   perspective. And you go in there trying, giving some of those stories, trying to help people.
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:12.560]   What's it like to get anything done?
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:15.920]   It's an incredible cognitive lift.
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:19.920]   That's a nice way to put it, yeah.
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:27.280]   To get things done. There are a lot of people who would prefer to
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:33.840]   cling to the problem, and they're talking points about how they're going to solve it,
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:40.320]   rather than sort of roll up their sleeves and do the work it takes to build coalitions of support
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:46.800]   and find people who are willing to compromise and move the ball. And so, it's extremely difficult.
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:51.920]   Jared and I talk about it all the time. It probably should be, because these are highly
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:58.000]   consequential policies that impact people's lives at scale. It shouldn't be so easy to do them,
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:05.760]   and they are doable, but it's challenging. One of the first experiences I had where it really was
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:14.720]   just a full grind effort was with tax cuts and the work I did to get the child tax credit doubled as
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:21.120]   part of it. And it just meant meeting after meeting after meeting after meeting with a lawmaker,
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:26.320]   convincing them of why this is good policy, going into their districts, campaigning in their
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:33.680]   districts, helping them convince their constituents of why it's important, of why child care support
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:40.080]   is important, of why paid family leave is important, of different policies that impact
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:50.080]   working American families. So, it's hard, but it's really rewarding. And then to get it done,
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:57.440]   I mean, just the child tax credit alone, 40 million American families got an average of $2,200
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:05.360]   each year as a result of the doubling of the child tax credit. So, it's one component of tax cuts.
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:10.880]   - When I was researching this stuff, you just get to think the scale of things,
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:17.440]   the scale of impact is 40 million families. Each one of those is a story, is a story of struggle,
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:24.400]   of trying to give a large part of your life to a job while still being able to give love and
[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:29.360]   support and care to a family, to kids, and to manage all of that. Each one of those is a little
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:36.080]   puzzle that they have to solve. And it's a life and death puzzle. You can lose your home,
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:43.040]   your security, you can lose your job, you can screw stuff up with parenting. So, you can mess
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:51.120]   all that up and you're trying to hold it together. And government policies can help make that easier,
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:56.640]   or can, in some cases, make that possible. And you get to do that at a scale, not of like five
[01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:01.200]   or 10 families, but like 40 million families. And that's just one thing.
[02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:06.000]   - Yeah. The people who shared with me their experience and, you know, during the campaign,
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:12.800]   it was what they hoped to see happen. Once you were in there, it was what they were seeing,
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:20.480]   what they were experiencing, the result of the policies. And that was the fuel. You know,
[02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:26.880]   on the hardest days, like that was the fuel. Child tax credit. I remember visiting with a woman,
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:31.120]   Brittany Houseman. She came to the White House. She had two small children. She was pregnant with
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:36.000]   her third. Her husband was killed in a car accident. She was in school at the time. Her
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:43.360]   dream was to become a criminal justice advocate. That was no longer on the table for her after he
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:49.120]   passed away. And she became the sole earner and provider for her family. And she couldn't afford
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:56.240]   childcare. She couldn't afford to stay in school. So she ended up creating a childcare center in
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:03.280]   her home. And her center was so successful because in part of different policies we worked on,
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:08.560]   including the childcare block grants that went to the state, she ended up opening additional centers.
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:14.720]   I visited her at one of them in Colorado. Now she has like a huge focus on helping
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:21.600]   teenage moms who don't have the resources to afford quality childcare for their kids
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:25.920]   come into her centers and programs. And, you know, it's stories like that
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:31.840]   of the hardships people face, but also what they do with opportunity when they're given it
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:38.160]   that really like powers you through tough moments when you're in Washington.
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:44.320]   - What can you say about the process of like bringing that to life? So the child tax credits,
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:52.880]   so doubling them from a thousand, 2000 per child. Well, like what are the challenges of that
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:56.960]   getting people to compromise? I'm sure there's a lot of politicians playing games with that
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.280]   because maybe it's a Republican that came up with an idea or a Democrat that came up with an idea.
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:05.920]   And so they don't want to give credit to the idea. And there's probably all kinds of games happening
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:12.720]   where they, when the game is happening, you probably forget about the families. Each politician
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:18.000]   thinks about how they can benefit themselves. You forget like the serving part of the role
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.320]   you're supposed to be in. - There were definitely people
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:25.760]   I met with in Washington who I felt that was true of, but, you know, they all go back to
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:30.720]   their districts and I assume that they all have similar experiences to what I had where people
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:35.120]   share their stories. So there'd be something really cynical about thinking they forget,
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:38.480]   but, you know, some do. - You help get people together.
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:42.880]   What's that take? Trying to get people to compromise, trying to get people to see
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:45.360]   the common humanity. - I think first and foremost,
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:51.280]   you have to be willing to talk with them. So, you know, one of the policies I advocate for was paid
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:57.600]   family leave. We left and 9 million more Americans had it through a combination of securing it for
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:03.920]   our federal workforce. I had people in the White House who were pregnant who didn't have access to
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:09.520]   paid leave. So we want to keep people attached to the workforce, yet when they have an important
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:16.560]   life event like a child, we create an impossibility for that. You know, some people don't even have
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:26.080]   access to unpaid leave if they're part-time workers. And so that, and then we also put in
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:32.560]   place the first ever national tax credit for workers making under $72,000 a year where employers
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:37.520]   could then offer it to their workers. That was also part of tax cuts. So, you know, part of it
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:45.360]   is really taking the arguments as to why this is good, smart, well-designed policy to people.
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:52.000]   And, you know, it was one of my big surprises that on certain policy issues that I thought
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:04:00.160]   would have been well-socialized, the policies that existed were never shared across the aisle.
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:05.840]   So people just lived with them, maybe in hopes that one day they would have the votes to get
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:11.680]   exactly what they want. But I was surprised by how little discussion there was. So I think part
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:17.840]   of it is be willing to have those tough discussions with people who may not share your viewpoint and
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:27.440]   be an active listener when they point out flaws and they have suggestions for changes. Not believing
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:34.080]   that you have a monopoly on good ideas. And I think there has to be a lot of humility in
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:42.000]   architecting these things and a policy should benefit from that type of well-rounded input.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.200]   Yeah, be able to see, like you said, well-designed policies. There's probably like the details are
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:53.920]   important too. Like there's just like with architecture and you walk the rooms, there's
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:05:00.240]   probably really good designs of policies, like economic policy that helps families, that delivers
[02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:06.720]   the maximum amount of money or resources to families that need it, and is not a waste of
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:13.120]   money. So like that, there's probably really nice designs there, nice ideas that are bipartisan,
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:18.240]   that has nothing to do with politics, has to do with just great economic policy, just great policies.
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:20.560]   And that requires listening.
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:26.960]   Requires trust too. Like I learned tax cuts was really interesting for me because I met with so
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:35.040]   many people across the political spectrum on advancing that policy. I really figured out
[02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:40.000]   who was willing to deviate from their talking points when the door was closed and who wasn't.
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:49.280]   You know, and it takes some courage to do that, especially without surety that it would actually
[02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:54.160]   get done, you know, especially if they've campaigned on something that was slightly different.
[02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:59.840]   And, you know, not everyone has that courage. So through tax cuts, I learned the people who
[02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:05.520]   did have that courage, and I went back to that well time and time again on policies that I
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:10.560]   thought were important. You know, some were bipartisan. The Great American Outdoors Act
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:15.040]   is something, it's incredible policy.
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:16.160]   I love that one.
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:21.440]   Yeah, it's amazing. It's one of the largest pieces of conservation legislation since
[02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:29.760]   the national park system was created. And, you know, over 300 million people visit our national
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:34.880]   parks, the vast majority of them being Americans every year. So this is something that is real
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:40.000]   and beneficial for people's lives, getting rid of the deferred maintenance, permanently funding them.
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:45.920]   But there are other issues like that that just weren't being prioritized. Modernizing,
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:51.840]   Perkins CTE, you know, and vocational education. And it's something I became super passionate about
[02:06:51.840 --> 02:07:00.480]   and helped lead the charge on. I think in America for a really long period of time,
[02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:05.200]   we've really believed that education stops when you leave high school or college.
[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:11.920]   And that is not true, and that's a dangerous way to think. So how can we both galvanize the private
[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:16.720]   sector to ensure that they continue to train workers for the jobs they know are coming,
[02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:24.880]   and how they train their existing workforce into the new jobs with robotics or machinery or new
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:30.640]   technologies that are coming down the pike. So galvanizing the private sector to join us
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:37.760]   in that effort. So whether it's the legislative side, like the actual legislation of Perkins CTE,
[02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:43.840]   which was focused on vocational education, or whether it's the ability to use the White House
[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:50.480]   to galvanize the private sector. We got over 16 million commitments from the private sector
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:57.200]   to retrain or reskill workers into the jobs of tomorrow. Yeah, there's so many aspects of
[02:07:57.200 --> 02:08:03.280]   education that you helped on. Access to STEM and computer science education. So the CT thing you're
[02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:07.200]   mentioning, modernizing career and technical education, that's millions and millions of people.
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:14.320]   The Act provided nearly $1.3 billion annually to more than 13 million students to better align
[02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:21.120]   the employer needs and all that kind of stuff. Very large scale policies that help a lot of
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:26.320]   people. It's fascinating. Education often isn't like the bright, shiny object everyone's running
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:33.280]   towards. So one of the hard things in politics, when there's something that is good policy,
[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:38.800]   sometimes it has no momentum because it doesn't have a cheerleader. So where are areas of good
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:46.400]   policy that you can like literally just carry across the finish line? Because people tend to
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:53.120]   run towards what's the news of the day, sort of to try to address whatever issue is being
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:58.800]   talked about on the front pages of papers. And there's so many issues that need to be addressed.
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:04.800]   And education is one of them that's just underprioritized. Human trafficking,
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:08.960]   that's an issue that I didn't go to the White House thinking I would work on. But you hear
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:16.960]   a story of a survivor, and you can't not want to eradicate one of the greatest evils
[02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:24.560]   that the mind can even imagine, the trafficking of people, the exploitation of children.
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:29.120]   And I think for so many, they assume that this is a problem that doesn't happen
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:35.840]   on our shores. It's something that you may experience at far-flung destinations across
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:41.200]   the world, but it's happening there and it's happening here as well. And so through a
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:49.280]   coalition of people that on both sides of the aisle that I came to trust and to work well with,
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:56.160]   we were able to get legislation which the president signed, passed nine pieces of legislation,
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:02.400]   combating trafficking at home and abroad, and digital exploitation of children.
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:08.640]   How much of a toll does that take, seeing all the problems in the world at such a large scale,
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:15.040]   the immensity of it all? Was that hard to walk around with that, just knowing how much suffering
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:19.680]   there is in the world? As you're trying to help all of it, as you're trying to design government
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:26.160]   policies to help all of that, it's also a very visceral recognition that there is suffering in
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:34.560]   the world. How difficult is that to walk around with? You feel it intensely. You know, we were
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:40.320]   just talking about human trafficking. I mean, you don't design these policies in the absence
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:47.040]   of the input of survivors themselves, so you hear their stories. I remember a woman who was really
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:54.640]   influential in my thinking, Andrea Hipwell, who she was in college where she was lured out by
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:11:01.760]   a guy she thought was a good guy, started dating him. He gets her hooked on drugs, convinces her
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:07.520]   to drop out of college, and spends the next five years selling her. She only got out when she was
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:12.320]   arrested, and all too often that's happening, too, that the victim's being targeted,
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:19.760]   not the perpetrator. So we did a lot with DOJ around changing that,
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:27.120]   but now she's helping other survivors get skills and job training and
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:34.960]   the therapeutic interventions they need. But you speak with people like Andrea and so many others,
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:42.640]   and I mean, you can't not, your heart gets seized by it, and it's both,
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:46.880]   it's motivating and it's hard. It's really hard.
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:50.560]   I was just talking to a brain surgeon. Many of the surgery he has to do,
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:12:00.800]   he knows the chances are very low of success, and he says that that wears at his armor,
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:05.120]   it chips away. It's like, only so many times can you do that.
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:08.400]   And thank God he's doing it, because I bet you there are a lot of others that don't
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:11.520]   choose that particular field because of those low success rates.
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:18.400]   But you can see the pain in his eyes. Maintaining your humanity while doing all of it,
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:22.400]   you could see the story, you could see the family that loves that person,
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:29.680]   just you feel the immensity of that. And you feel the heartbreak involved with mortality in that
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:35.440]   case, and with suffering also in that case. And in general, in all these, in human trafficking,
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:44.400]   but even in helping families try to stay afloat, trying to break out or escape poverty, all that,
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:46.960]   you get to see those stories of struggle. It's not easy.
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:55.360]   But the people that really feel the humanity of that, feel the pain of that, are probably the
[02:12:55.360 --> 02:13:00.720]   right people to be politicians. But it's probably also why you can't stay in there too long.
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:08.080]   It's the only time in my life where you actually feel, like there's always a conflict, right,
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:15.600]   between work and life and making sure. As a woman, I'd often get asked about, "How do you
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:24.480]   balance work and family?" And I never liked that question because balance, it's elusive, right?
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:33.200]   You're one fever away from like, "No balance." You're child sick one day, "What do you do?"
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:40.640]   There goes balance. Or you have a huge project with a deadline, there goes balance. I think
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:44.880]   a better way to frame it is, "Am I living in accordance with my priorities?"
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:51.200]   Maybe not every day, but every week, every month, and reflecting on have you
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:57.840]   architected a life that aligns with your priorities so that more often than not,
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:05.920]   you're where you need to be in that moment. And service at that level was the one time where you
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:13.840]   feel incredibly conflicted about having any priorities other than serving. It's finite.
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:19.520]   In every business I've built, you're building for duration. And then you go into the White House,
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:22.560]   and it is sand through an hourglass. Whether it's four years or eight years,
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:28.960]   it's a finite period of time you have. And most people don't last four years. I think the average
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:36.960]   in the White House is 18 months. It's exhausting. But it's the only time when you're at home with
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:43.360]   your own children that you think about all the people you've met, and you feel guilty about any
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:53.200]   time that's spent not advancing those interests to the best of your capacity. And that's a hard
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:59.760]   thing. That's a really hard feeling as a parent. And it's really challenging then to be present,
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:07.280]   to always need to answer your phone, to always need to be available. It's very difficult.
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:12.160]   It's taxing. But it's also the greatest privilege in the world.
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:16.400]   So through that, the turmoil of that, the hardship of that, what was the role of family
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:19.520]   through all of that, Jared and the kids? What was that like?
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:28.320]   That was everything, to have that, to have the support systems I had in place with my husband.
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:33.360]   We had left New York and wound up in Washington. In New York, I lived
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:38.160]   10 blocks away from my mother-in-law, who if I wasn't taking my kids to school, she was. So
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:43.280]   we lost some of that, which was very hard, but we had what mattered, which was each other.
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:53.680]   My kids were young. When I got to Washington, Theo, my youngest, was 8 months old. And Arabella,
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:16:02.880]   my oldest, my daughter, was 5 years old. So they were still quite young. We have a son,
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:12.560]   Joseph, who's 3. And I think for me, the dose of levity, coming home at night
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:23.840]   and having them there and just joyful, it was super grounding and important for me.
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:30.960]   I still remember, Theo, when he was around 3, 3 1/2 years old, Jared used to make me coffee
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:36.560]   every morning, and it was my great luxury that I would sit there. He still makes it for me every
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:40.240]   morning. I told him I'm never--even though I secretly know how to actually work the coffee
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:44.480]   machine--but I've convinced him that I have no idea how to work the coffee machine. Now I'm going
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:50.880]   to be busted. But it's a skill I don't want to learn because it's one of his acts of love. He
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:58.320]   brings me coffee every morning in bed while I read the newspapers, and Theo would watch this.
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:04.480]   And so he got Jared to teach him how to make coffee, and Theo learned how to make a full-blown
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:12.640]   cappuccino. And he had so much joy in every morning bringing me this cappuccino. And I
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:21.520]   remember the sound of his little steps, the slide. It was so cute coming down the hallway
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:26.400]   with my perfectly foamed cappuccino. Now I try to get him to make me coffee, and he's like,
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:32.000]   "Come on, Mom." That was a moment in time, but we had a lot of little
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:35.600]   moments like that that were just amazing.
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:42.880]   Yeah, I got a chance to chat with him, and he has a--his silliness and sense of humor, it's
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:51.360]   really joyful. I could see how that could be an escape from the madness of Washington,
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:52.720]   of the adult life, the quote-unquote adult life.
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:56.480]   And they were young enough. We really kept our home life pretty sheltered from
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:01.120]   everything else, and we were able to do so because they were so young and because they
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:05.760]   weren't connected to the internet. They were too young for smartphones, all of these things.
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:12.880]   We were able to shelter and protect them and allow them to have as normal an upbringing
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:21.840]   as was possible in the context we were living. And they brought me, and continue to bring me,
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:27.360]   so much joy. But they were--I mean, without Jared and without the kids, it would have been
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:29.280]   much more lonely.
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:34.560]   Yeah. So three kids, you've now upgraded, two dogs and a hamster.
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:42.640]   Well, our second dog, so we rescued him thinking he--we thought he was probably like part German
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:48.800]   shepherd, part lab is what we were told. He's now--I don't even know if he qualifies as a dog,
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:55.120]   he's like the size of a horse, a small horse, Simba. So I don't think he has much lab in him,
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:19:03.760]   I think--we--Joseph has not wanted to do a DNA test because he really wanted a German shepherd,
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:04.800]   so he's a German shepherd.
[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:06.240]   He's gigantic, yeah.
[02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:12.320]   He is gigantic. And we also have a hamster who's the newest addition because my son, Theo,
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:20.240]   he tried to get a dog as well. Our first dog, Winter, became my daughter's dog as she wouldn't
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:25.760]   let her brothers play with him or sleep with him and was old enough to bully them into submission.
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:29.120]   So then Joseph wanted a dog and got Simba. Theo now wants a dog
[02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:33.120]   and has Buster the hamster in the interim, so we'll see.
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:40.160]   What advice would you give to other mothers just having--planning on having kids and maybe advice
[02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:43.520]   to yourself on figuring out this puzzle?
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:53.040]   I think being a parent, you have to cultivate within yourself, like, heightened levels of
[02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:59.200]   empathy. You have to really look at each child and see them for who they are, what they enjoy,
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:11.360]   what they love, and meet them where they're at. And I think that can be enormously challenging
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:16.160]   when your kids are so different in temperament. As they get older, that difference in temperament
[02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:23.280]   may be within the same child depending on the moment of the day. But I think it's actually
[02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:31.280]   made me a much softer person, a much better listener. I think I see people more truly for
[02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:38.800]   who they are as opposed to how I want them to be sometimes. And I think being a parent to three
[02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:45.120]   children who are all exceptional and all incredibly different has enabled that in me.
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:48.880]   I think for me, though, they've also been like some of my greatest teachers
[02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:55.600]   in that we were talking about the presence you felt when you were in the jungle
[02:20:55.600 --> 02:21:05.200]   and the connectivity you felt and sort of the simple joy. And I think for us as we grow older,
[02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:10.800]   we kind of disconnect from that. My kids have taught me how to play again. And that's beautiful.
[02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:16.560]   I remember just a couple of weeks ago, we had one of these crazy Miami torrential downpours,
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:20.320]   and Arabella comes down. It's around 8 o'clock at night. It's really raining.
[02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:28.400]   And she's got rain boots and pajama pants on, and she's going to take the dogs for a walk in the
[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:32.960]   rain. Which, you know, she had all day to walk, but she wasn't doing it because they needed to
[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:37.600]   go for a walk. She was like, "This would be fun." And I'm standing at the doorstep watching her,
[02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:42.720]   and she goes out with Simba and Winter, this massive dog and this little tiny dog.
[02:21:42.720 --> 02:21:47.920]   And I'm watching her walk to the end of the driveway, and she's just dancing,
[02:21:47.920 --> 02:21:52.960]   and it's pouring. And I took off my shoes, and I went out, and I joined her, and we danced in
[02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:58.960]   the rain. And even as like a preteen who normally, you know, she like allowed me to experience the
[02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:05.760]   joy with her. And it was amazing. We can be so much more fun if we allow ourselves to be more
[02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:12.000]   playful. We can be so much more present. I look at--Theo loves games, so we play a whole lot of
[02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:17.840]   board games, any kind of game. So it started with board games. We do a lot of puzzles.
[02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:21.280]   Then it became card games. I just taught him how to play poker.
[02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:28.480]   He loves backgammon, like any kind of game. And he's so fully in them. You know, when he
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:36.240]   plays, he plays. My son Joseph, he loves nature. And he'll say to me sometimes when like I'm taking
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:41.440]   a picture of something he's observing, like a beautiful sunset, he's like, "Mom, just experience
[02:22:41.440 --> 02:22:50.160]   it." I'm like, "Yes, you're right, Joseph. Just experience it." You know, so those kids have taught
[02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:55.920]   me so much about sort of reconnecting with what's real and what's true and being present in the
[02:22:55.920 --> 02:23:02.400]   moment and experiencing joy. - They always give you permission to sort of reignite the inner child,
[02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:08.240]   just be a kid again. Yeah. And it's interesting what you said, that the puzzle of noticing
[02:23:08.240 --> 02:23:12.960]   each human being, like what makes them beautiful, the unique characteristics,
[02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:23.520]   like what they're good at, the way they want to be mentored. I often see that,
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:29.520]   especially with coaches and athletes, young athletes aspiring to be great,
[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:36.880]   each athlete needs to be trained in a different way. Like I, for example, with some you need a
[02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:42.800]   softer approach. Like with me, I always like a dictatorial approach. I like the coach to be this
[02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:49.120]   menacing figure. That brought out the best in me. I didn't want to be friends with the coach.
[02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:56.320]   I want to almost, I think it's weird to say, but yell that like to be pushed, but that doesn't
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:24:01.840]   work for everybody. And that's a risk you have to take in the coach context of like,
[02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:07.920]   'cause you can't just yell at everybody. You have to figure out like, what does each person need?
[02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:14.240]   And when you have kids, I imagine the puzzle is even harder. - And when they all need different
[02:24:14.240 --> 02:24:19.280]   things, but yet coexist and are sometimes competitive with one another. So you'll be
[02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:23.600]   at a dinner table, the amount of times I get, well, that's not fair. Why did you let, and I'm
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:28.000]   like, life isn't fair. And by the way, like, I'm not here to be fair. I'm like, I'm trying to give
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:33.200]   you each what you need. Especially when I've been working really hard and, you know, in the White
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:38.080]   House, I'd say, okay, well now we have a Sunday and we have these hours and I'll have like a grand
[02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:42.720]   plan, you know, and we're going to make it count. And it's going to involve, you know,
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:50.080]   hot chocolate and sleds, you know, whatever, whatever it is that like my great adventure,
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:55.200]   that we're going to go play mini golf. And then I come down all psyched up, all ready to go.
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:25:01.440]   And the kids have zero interest. And there have been a lot of times where I've been like,
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:06.160]   we're doing this thing. And then I realized, wait a second, you know, like sometimes you just like
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:11.680]   plop down on the floor and start playing magnet tiles, you know, and like, that's where they need
[02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:19.440]   you. And so, so those of us who have sort of like alpha personalities who sometimes it's just,
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:25.600]   just witness, like witness what they need. Don't like play with them and allow them to lead the
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:33.280]   play. Don't force them down a road you may think is more interesting or productive or educational
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:40.080]   or edifying, you know, just, just be with them, observe them and, and then show them that you are
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:45.040]   genuinely curious about the things that they are genuinely curious about.
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:50.320]   I think there's a lot of love when you do that. - Also, there's just fascinating puzzles. I was
[02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:59.200]   talking to a friend yesterday and she has four kids and they fight a lot and she, she generally
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:05.600]   wants to break up the fights, but she's like, I'm not sure if I'm just supposed to let them fight.
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:10.080]   Can they figure it out? But you always break, break them up because I'm told that it's okay
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:14.800]   for them to fight. Kids do that. They kind of figure out their own situation. That's part
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:19.280]   of like the growing up process, but you want to always, especially if it's physical, they're like
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:24.320]   pushing each other. You want to kind of stop it, but at the same time, it's also part of the play,
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:29.520]   part of the dynamics. And that's a puzzle you also have to figure out. And plus you're probably
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:35.120]   worried that they're going to get hurt. - I think there's like, when it gets physical,
[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:39.200]   that's like, okay, we have to intervene. I know you're into martial arts, but
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:45.600]   that's normally like the red line, you know, once it, once it tips into that, but there is always
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:50.160]   that, you know, like you have to allow them to problem solve for themselves. Like a little
[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:55.280]   interpersonal conflict is, is good. It's really hard when you try to navigate something because
[02:26:55.280 --> 02:27:00.160]   everyone thinks you're taking their side. You have oftentimes incomplete information. It's,
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:07.840]   I think for parents, what tends to happen too is we see our kids fighting with each other in a way
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:15.200]   that all kids do. And we start to project into the future and like catastrophize, you know,
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:21.840]   if like my two sons are going through a moment where they're like oil and water, anything one
[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:27.360]   wants to do, the other doesn't want to do. It's like a very interesting moment. So my instinct is
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:32.240]   they're not going to like each other when they're 25. You know, you sort of project into the future
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:38.400]   as opposed to recognizing this is a stage that I too went through and it's normal and it's not
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:46.800]   building it in your mind into, into something that's unnecessarily consequential.
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:49.120]   It's short-term formative conflict.
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:49.620]   Yeah.
[02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:58.960]   So, uh, ever since 2016, the, the number and the level of attacks you've been under has been
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:06.000]   steadily increasing, has been super intense. How do you walk through the fire of that? You've been
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:14.320]   very stoic about the whole thing. I don't think I've ever seen you respond to an attack. You
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:21.440]   just let it pass over you. You stay positive and you focus on solving problems. And you didn't
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:27.520]   engage while being in DC, you didn't engage into the back and forth fire of the politics.
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:29.840]   So what's your philosophy behind that?
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:34.000]   I appreciate your saying that I was very stoic about it. I think,
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:39.040]   you know, I feel things pretty deeply. So initially, some of that
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:47.520]   really took me off guard, like some of the derivative love and hatred, um, some of the
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:55.360]   intensity of, of, of the attacks. Um, and there were times when it was, it was so easy to counter
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:29:02.800]   it. I'd even write something out and, and say, well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna press send and never
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:10.720]   did. I, I felt that sort of getting into the mud, fighting back, it didn't run true to who I am as
[02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:17.680]   a human being. Like it didn't, it felt at odds with, with who I am and how I want to spend my
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:24.240]   time. So I think as a result, I was oftentimes on the receiving end of a lot of, a lot of cheap
[02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:28.720]   shots. And I'm okay with that because it's sort of the way I know how to be in the world. I was
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:35.520]   focused on things I thought mattered more. And, you know, I, I think part of me also
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:43.200]   internalized, there's a concept in Judaism called Lashon Hara, which is translated into,
[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:51.680]   I think, quite literally evil speech. And the idea that, you know, speaking poorly of another
[02:29:53.120 --> 02:30:00.480]   is almost the moral equivalent to murder because you can't really repair it. You can apologize,
[02:30:00.480 --> 02:30:06.000]   but you can't repair it. Another component of that is that it does as much damage to the person
[02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:13.920]   saying the words, then it does to the person receiving them. And I think about that a lot.
[02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:20.560]   I talk about this concept with, with my kids a lot. And I'm not willing to pay the price
[02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:28.800]   of that fleeting and momentary satisfaction of, of sort of swinging back because I think it would
[02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:36.560]   be, it would be too expensive for my soul. And, and that's how I kind of made peace with it because
[02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:44.320]   I think that's just, that feels more true for me. But it is a little bit contrary in politics.
[02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:54.640]   It's, it's definitely, it's definitely a contrarian viewpoint to, to not get into the fray.
[02:30:54.640 --> 02:31:00.080]   Actually, somebody I love, Dolly Parton, says that she doesn't condemn or criticize,
[02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:04.880]   she loves and accepts. And I like that. It feels, it feels right for me.
[02:31:04.880 --> 02:31:11.520]   I also like that you said that words have power. It's not, sometimes people say, well, words,
[02:31:12.640 --> 02:31:18.480]   when you speak negatively of others, ah, that's just words. But I think there's a cost to that.
[02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:23.360]   There's a cost, like you said, to your soul. And there's a cost in terms of the damage you can do
[02:31:23.360 --> 02:31:28.240]   to the other person, whether it's to their reputation publicly or to them privately,
[02:31:28.240 --> 02:31:35.120]   just as a human being psychologically. And in the place that it puts them, because they think,
[02:31:35.120 --> 02:31:38.960]   they start thinking negatively in general, and then maybe they respond and there's this vicious
[02:31:38.960 --> 02:31:43.600]   downward spiral that happens, that almost like we don't intend to, but it destroys everybody
[02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:52.800]   in the process. You quoted Alan Watts, I love him, in saying, quote, "You're under no obligation to
[02:31:52.800 --> 02:31:59.520]   be the same person you were five minutes ago." So how have the years in DC and the years after
[02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:04.640]   changed you? I love Alan Watts too.
[02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:10.880]   I listen to his lecture sometimes falling asleep. He's got like an on planes, he's got like the most
[02:32:10.880 --> 02:32:16.240]   soothing voice. But I love what he said about, "You have no obligation to be who you were five
[02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:23.200]   minutes ago," because we should always feel that we have the ability to evolve and grow and better
[02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:30.560]   ourselves. I think further than that, if we don't look back on who we were a few years ago, with
[02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:39.360]   some level of embarrassment, we're not growing enough. When I look back, I'm like, "Oh." I feel
[02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:49.520]   like that feeling is because you're growing into hopefully sort of a better version of yourself.
[02:32:49.520 --> 02:32:56.000]   And I hope and feel that that's been true for me as well. I think the person I am today,
[02:32:56.880 --> 02:33:05.280]   we spoke in the beginning of our discussion about some of my earliest ambitions in real
[02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:11.840]   estate and in fashion, and those were amazing adventures and incredible experiences in
[02:33:11.840 --> 02:33:19.440]   government. And I feel today that all of those ambitions are more fully integrated into me as a
[02:33:19.440 --> 02:33:26.560]   human being. I'm much more comfortable with the various pieces of my personality and that any
[02:33:26.560 --> 02:33:32.480]   professional drive is more integrated into more simple pleasures. Everything for me has gotten
[02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:39.840]   much simpler and easier in terms of what I want to do and what I want to be. And I think that's
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:48.080]   where my kids have been my teachers, just being fully present and enjoying the little moments.
[02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:54.480]   And it doesn't mean I'm any less driven than I was before. It's just more a part of me than
[02:33:54.480 --> 02:34:01.360]   being sort of the all-consuming energy one has in their 20s.
[02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:06.800]   Yeah, just like you said with your mom, be able to let go and enjoy the water, the sun,
[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:12.320]   the beach, and enjoy the moment, the simplicity of the moment.
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:18.880]   I think a lot about the fact that for a lot of young people, they really know what they want to
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:25.520]   do, but they don't actually know who they are. And then I think as you get older, hopefully you
[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:30.480]   know who you are and you're much more comfortable with ambiguity around what you want to do and
[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:35.360]   accomplish. You're more flexible in your thinking around those things.
[02:34:35.360 --> 02:34:37.600]   And give yourself permission to be who you are.
[02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:38.100]   Yeah.
[02:34:38.100 --> 02:34:44.800]   You made the decision not to engage in the politics of the 2024 campaign.
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:47.440]   If it's okay, let me read what you wrote on the topic.
[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:54.160]   Quote, "I love my father very much. This time around, I'm choosing to prioritize my young
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:35:00.560]   children and the private life we're creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.
[02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:05.360]   While I will always love and support my father going forward, I will do so outside the political
[02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:10.720]   arena. I'm grateful to have had the honor of serving the American people, and I will always
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:16.400]   be proud of many of our administration's accomplishments." So can you explain your
[02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:18.880]   thinking, your philosophy behind that decision?
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:27.680]   I think first and foremost, it was a decision rooted in me being a parent, really thinking
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:35.840]   about what they need from me now. You know, politics is a rough, rough business, and I think
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:43.280]   it's one that you also can't dabble in. I think you have to either be all in or all out. And I
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:54.880]   know today the cost they would pay for me being all in emotionally in terms of my absence at such
[02:35:54.880 --> 02:36:02.960]   a formative point in their life, and I'm not willing to make them bear that cost. I served
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:10.880]   for four years and feel so privileged to have done it, but as their mom, I think it's really
[02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:16.400]   important that I do what's right for them. And I think there are a lot of ways you can serve.
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:22.080]   I think there's, obviously, we talked about the enormity, the scale of what can be accomplished
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:30.000]   in government service, but I think there's something equally valuable about helping
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:36.960]   within your own community. I volunteer with the kids a lot, and we feel really good about that
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:42.880]   service. It's different, but it's no less meaningful. So I think there are other ways
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:52.400]   to serve. I also think, you know, politics is a pretty dark world. There's a lot of darkness,
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:37:00.640]   a lot of negativity, and it's just really at odds with what feels good for me as a human being.
[02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:12.640]   And it's a really rough business. So for me and my family, it feels right to not participate.
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:19.040]   So it wears on your soul. And yeah, there is a bit, at least from an outsider's perspective,
[02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:24.080]   a bit of darkness in that part of our world. I wish it didn't have to be this way.
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:24.960]   Me too.
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:30.480]   I think part of that darkness is just watching all the legal turmoil that's going on.
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:37.360]   What's it like for you to see that, your father involved in that, going through that?
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:47.120]   On a human level, it's my father. And I love him very much, so it's painful to experience.
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:50.240]   But ultimately, I wish it didn't have to be this way.
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:55.760]   I like it that underneath all of this, "I love my father" is the thing that you lead with.
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:38:05.120]   That's so true. It is family. And I hope amidst all this turmoil, love is the thing that wins.
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:06.960]   It usually does.
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:11.920]   In the end, yes. But in the short term, there is, like we were talking about,
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:14.240]   there's a bit of bickering. But at least no more duels.
[02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:17.360]   No more duels.
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:19.040]   You mentioned Dolly Parton.
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:22.960]   That's a segue.
[02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:27.200]   Listen, I'm not very good at this thing. I'm trying to figure out.
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:29.040]   Okay, we both love Dolly Parton.
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:37.280]   So you're big into live music. So maybe you can mention why you love Dolly Parton.
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:40.640]   I definitely would love to talk to her. I would love to interview her. She's such an icon.
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:42.400]   Oh, I hope you do.
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:46.640]   What I love about her, and I've really come to love her in recent years,
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:54.480]   is she's so authentically herself. And she's obviously so talented and so accomplished,
[02:38:54.480 --> 02:39:00.160]   and this extraordinary woman. But I just feel like she has no conflict within herself as to who she
[02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:07.200]   is. She reminds me a lot of my mom in that way. And it's super refreshing and really beautiful
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:15.440]   to observe somebody who's so in the public eye being so fully secure in who they are,
[02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:21.840]   what their talent is, and what drives them. So I think she's amazing. And she leads with a lot of
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:26.560]   love and positivity. So I think she's very cool. I hope you have a long conversation with her.
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:31.840]   Yeah, she's like, okay. So there's many things to say about her. First, incredibly great musician,
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:37.040]   songwriter, performer. Also can create an image and have fun with it.
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:41.040]   Have fun being herself over the top.
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:48.800]   It feels that way, right? After all these years, it feels like she enjoys what she does. And you
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:51.200]   also have the sense that if she didn't, she wouldn't do it.
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:56.400]   That's right. And just an iconic country musician, country music singer.
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:40:01.920]   There's a lot. We've talked about a lot of musicians. Who do you enjoy? You mentioned
[02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:05.360]   Adele, seeing her perform, hanging out with her.
[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:13.360]   Yeah, I mean, she's extraordinary. Her voice is unreal. I find her to be so talented. And she's
[02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:19.040]   so unique in that three-year-olds love her music. She was actually the first concert Arabella ever
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:24.560]   went to at Madison Square Garden when she was around four. And 90-year-olds love her music.
[02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:31.600]   And that's pretty rare to have that kind of bandwidth of resonance. So I think she's so
[02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:36.320]   talented. We actually just saw her. I took all three kids in Las Vegas around a month ago.
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:44.560]   Alice Johnson, whose case I had worked with in the White House, my father commuted her sentence.
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:51.920]   Her case was brought to me by a friend, Kim Kardashian. And she came to the show. We all
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:59.600]   went together with some mutual friends. And it was amazing to see Adele, but it was a very profound
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:04.240]   experience for me to have with my kids because she rode with us in a car on the way to the show.
[02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:11.120]   And she talked to my kids about her experience and her story and how her case found its way to me.
[02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:17.600]   And I think for young children, it's very abstract, you know, policy. And so for her to be
[02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:24.800]   able to share with them this was a very beautiful moment and led to a lot of really incredible
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:31.360]   conversations with each of my kids about our time in service because, you know, they gave up a lot
[02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:37.600]   for me to do it. Actually, Alice told them the most beautiful story about the plays she used
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:41.760]   to put on in prison, how these shows were like the hottest ticket in town. Like, you could not
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:48.160]   get into them. They always extended their run. But for the people who were in them, a lot of those
[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:57.520]   men and women had never experienced applause. Nobody had ever shown up at their games or at
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:03.840]   their plays and clapped for them. And the emotional experience of just being able to
[02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:10.800]   give someone that, you know, being able to stand and applaud for someone and how meaningful that
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:14.800]   was. And she was showing us pictures from these different productions. And it was a really,
[02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:22.480]   it was a beautiful moment. Alice actually, after her sentence was commuted and she came out of
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:29.600]   prison, together we worked on 23 different pardons or commutations. So the impact of
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:39.440]   her experience and how she was able to take her opportunity and create that same opportunity for
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:46.720]   others who were deserving and who she believed in was very beautiful. So anyway, that was an
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:50.320]   extraordinary concert experience for my kids to be able to have that moment.
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:52.960]   What a story. So just, that's the sort of, the—
[02:42:52.960 --> 02:42:56.720]   And then here we are dancing at Adele.
[02:42:56.720 --> 02:42:58.400]   Exactly. Exactly. It was like that turning point—
[02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:00.640]   Six years later. It was almost to the day, six years later.
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:05.600]   So that policy, that meeting of the minds resulted in a major turning point in her
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:08.080]   life and Alice's life and now you're dancing with Adele.
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:09.760]   And now we're at Adele.
[02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:13.680]   Yeah. I mean, you mentioned also there, I've seen commutations where
[02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:23.920]   it's an opportunity to step in and consider the ways that the justice system does not always work
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:31.680]   well. Like in cases when it's nonviolent crime and drug offenses, there's a case of a person
[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:37.680]   you mentioned that received a life sentence for selling weed.
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:45.120]   You know, and it's just the number, it's like hundreds of thousands of people are in the
[02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:51.280]   federal prison and jail and the system for drug, for selling drugs. That's the only thing with
[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:57.680]   no violence on their record whatsoever. And obviously there's a lot of complexity,
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:04.320]   the details matter, but oftentimes the justice system does not do right in the way we think
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:08.400]   right is. And it's nice to be able to step in and help people like, and direct them.
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:16.400]   They're overlooked and they have no advocate. Jared and I helped in a small way on his effort,
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:22.000]   but he really spearheaded the effort on criminal justice reform through the First Step Act, which
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:28.720]   was an enormously consequential piece of legislation that gave so many people another
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:34.480]   opportunity. And that was amazing. So working with him closely on that was a beautiful thing
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:38.720]   for us to also experience together. But in the final days of the administration, you know,
[02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:44.560]   you're not getting legislation passed. And anything you do administratively is going to be
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:50.240]   probably overturned by an incoming administration. So, you know, how do you use that time for
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:56.000]   maximum results? And I really dug in on pardons and commutations that I thought were
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:06.560]   overdue and were worthy. And my last night in Washington, D.C., the gentleman you mentioned,
[02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:13.760]   Corvin, I was on the phone with his mother at 1230 in the morning, telling her that her son
[02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:19.280]   would be getting out the next day. And it felt really, it's one person, but you see with Alice,
[02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:24.880]   like the ripple effect of, you know, the commutation granted to her and her ability and
[02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:30.800]   the impact she'll have within her family with her grandkids. And now she's an advocate for so many
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:36.160]   others who are voiceless. You know, it felt like, it felt like the perfect way to end four years to
[02:45:36.160 --> 02:45:42.400]   be able to, to be able to call those parents and call those kids in some cases and give them the
[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:46.480]   news that a loved one was coming home. And I just love the cool image of you,
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:50.080]   Kim Kardashian, and Alice just dancing on Adele show with the kids. I love it.
[02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:55.600]   Well, Kim wasn't at the Adele show, but she had connected us. It was beautiful.
[02:45:55.600 --> 02:46:05.360]   Yeah. The way Adele can hold just like the badassness she has on stage. She does like
[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:09.600]   heartbreak songs like better than anyone, or no, it's not even heartbreak. Like what's,
[02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:14.800]   what's that genre of song? Like rolling in the deep, like a little anger, a little love,
[02:46:14.800 --> 02:46:20.080]   a little like something, a little attitude, and just like one of the greatest voices ever.
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:22.240]   All of that together, just by herself.
[02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:26.880]   Yeah. You can strip it down and the power of her voice. You know, I think about that.
[02:46:26.880 --> 02:46:32.400]   One of the things we were talking about live music, one of the amazing things now is you,
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:39.040]   there's so much incredible concert material that's been uploaded to YouTube. So sometimes I just sit
[02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:45.040]   there and watch these like old shows. We both love Stevie Ray Vaughan, like watching him perform.
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:47.680]   You can even find old videos of like Django Reinhardt.
[02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:48.240]   You got me.
[02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:48.720]   I got you.
[02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:49.600]   You got me, Stevie Ray Vaughan.
[02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:50.640]   Texas Flood.
[02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:55.200]   We had this moment, which is hilarious that you said like one of the songs you really like
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:57.520]   of Stevie's is Texas Flood.
[02:46:57.520 --> 02:46:59.440]   Well, my bucket list is to learn how to play it.
[02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:05.440]   It's a bucket list. It's just a bucket list item. You made me feel so good because for me,
[02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:09.920]   Texas Flood was the first solo on guitar I've ever learned because for me, it was like the
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:16.480]   impossible solo. And then that was, so I worked really hard to learn it. It's like one of the
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:24.000]   most iconic sort of blues songs, Texas blues songs. And now you made me fall in love with
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:28.400]   the song again, want to play it out live, at the very least put it up on YouTube.
[02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:33.120]   Because it is, it's so fun to improvise. And when you lose yourself in the song,
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:35.760]   it truly is a blues song. You can have fun with it.
[02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:37.120]   I hope you do do that.
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:38.080]   Throw on a Stevie Ray Vaughan.
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:39.680]   Regardless, I want you to play it for me.
[02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:42.000]   A hundred percent, a hundred percent.
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:47.040]   But he's amazing. And there's so many great performers that are playing live now.
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:52.400]   I just saw Chris Stapleton show. He's an amazing country artist.
[02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:53.120]   He's too good.
[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:54.640]   That guy is so good.
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:48:01.520]   Lucas Nelson's one of my favorite to see live. And there's so many incredible songwriters and
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:06.720]   musicians that are out there touring today. But I think you also, you can go online and watch some
[02:48:06.720 --> 02:48:11.680]   of these old performances like Django Reinhardt was the first, because I torture myself,
[02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:18.320]   was the first song I learned to play on the guitar. And it took me like nine months to a year.
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:22.160]   It was, I mean, I should have chosen a different song, but Uetu Monomore,
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:29.440]   one of his songs was, and it was like finger style and I was just going through and grinding it out.
[02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:34.640]   And that's kind of how I started to learn to play by playing that song.
[02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:40.720]   But to see these old videos of him playing, without all his fingers and the skill and the
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:46.960]   dexterity. One of my favorite live performances is actually who really influenced Adele as Aretha
[02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:54.240]   Franklin. And she did this, she did a version of Amazing Grace. Have you ever seen this video?
[02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:54.800]   No.
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:49:00.560]   I cry. Look up. It was in LA. It was like the temple missionary Baptist church.
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:05.200]   Talk about stripped down. She's literally, I mean, just listen to this.
[02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:16.160]   Well, you could do one note and you could just kill it.
[02:49:16.160 --> 02:49:21.360]   The pain, the soulfulness.
[02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:25.680]   The spirit you feel in her when you watch this.
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:30.240]   That's true. Adele carries some of that spirit also, right?
[02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:36.160]   Yeah. And you can take away all the instruments with Adele and just have that voice.
[02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:44.800]   And it's so commanding and it's so amazing. Anyway, you watch this and you see the arc of
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:51.920]   also the experience of the people in the choir and them starting to join in. Anyway, it's amazing.
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:55.440]   I love watching Queen, like Freddie Mercury, Queen performances.
[02:49:55.440 --> 02:49:55.920]   Yeah.
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:49:59.280]   In terms of vocalists and just great stage presence.
[02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:02.240]   That Live Aid performance is considered one of the best of all, I think.
[02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:05.040]   I've watched that so many times. He's so cool.
[02:50:05.040 --> 02:50:06.320]   Here, wait. Pull up that for a second.
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:16.000]   Go to that part where he's saying "Radio Gaga" and they're all mimicking his arm moves. It's so cool.
[02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:20.720]   Look at that.
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:24.080]   Oh, man. I miss that guy.
[02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:25.120]   So good.
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:28.400]   So that's an example of a person that was born to be on stage.
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:34.160]   So good. Well, we were talking surfing, we were talking jiu-jitsu. I think live music
[02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:38.800]   is one of those kind of rare moments where you can really be present.
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:45.280]   Where something about the anticipation of choosing what show you're going to go to
[02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:49.520]   and then waiting for the date to come. And normally it happens in the context of community.
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:54.960]   You go with friends and then allowing yourself to sort of fall into it is incredible.
[02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:57.920]   So you've been training jiu-jitsu.
[02:50:57.920 --> 02:51:01.280]   Yes. Trying.
[02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:10.160]   I mean, I've seen you do jiu-jitsu. You're very athletic. You know how to use your body
[02:51:10.160 --> 02:51:14.960]   to commit violence. Maybe there's better ways of phrasing that, but anyway.
[02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:17.680]   It's been a skill that's been honed over time.
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:21.440]   Yeah. I mean, what do you like about jiu-jitsu?
[02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:26.320]   Well, first of all, I love the way I came to it. It was my daughter.
[02:51:26.320 --> 02:51:34.720]   I think I told you this story. At 11, she told me that she wanted to learn self-defense
[02:51:34.720 --> 02:51:39.760]   and she wanted to learn how to protect herself, which as a mom, I was so proud about because
[02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:44.880]   at 11, I was not thinking about defending myself. I loved that she had sort of that
[02:51:44.880 --> 02:51:52.720]   desire and awareness. So I called some friends, actually a mutual friend of ours, and asked
[02:51:52.720 --> 02:51:58.560]   around for people who I could work with in Miami. And they recommended the Valente Brothers
[02:51:58.560 --> 02:52:04.080]   studio. And you've met all three of them now. They're these remarkable human beings.
[02:52:04.080 --> 02:52:08.560]   And they've been so wonderful for our family. I mean, first starting with Arabella, I used
[02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:13.440]   to take her and then she'd kind of encourage me and she'd sort of pull me into it. And
[02:52:13.440 --> 02:52:20.080]   I started doing it with her. And then Joseph and Theo saw us doing it. They wanted to start
[02:52:20.080 --> 02:52:25.280]   doing it. So now they joined and then Jared joined. So now we're all doing jiu-jitsu.
[02:52:25.280 --> 02:52:30.240]   And for me, there's something really empowering knowing that I have some basic skills
[02:52:30.240 --> 02:52:35.280]   to defend myself. I think it's something as humans we've kind of gotten away from.
[02:52:35.280 --> 02:52:43.200]   You look at any other animal and even the giraffe, they'll use their neck. The lion,
[02:52:43.200 --> 02:52:50.560]   the tiger, every species. And then there's us, who most of us don't. And I didn't know
[02:52:50.560 --> 02:52:56.080]   how to protect myself. And I think that it gives you a sense of confidence and also gives you kind
[02:52:56.080 --> 02:53:02.960]   of a sense of calm, knowing how to deescalate rather than escalate a situation. I also think
[02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:15.440]   as part of the training, you develop more natural awareness when you're out and about.
[02:53:15.440 --> 02:53:19.440]   And I feel like especially, you know, everyone's you get on an elevator and like the first thing
[02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:23.200]   people do is pick up their phone. You're walking down the street. People are getting hit by cars
[02:53:23.200 --> 02:53:28.080]   because they're walking into traffic. I think as you start to get this training, you become
[02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:35.520]   much more aware of the broader context of what's happening around you, which is really healthy
[02:53:35.520 --> 02:53:41.840]   and good as well. It's been beautiful. Actually, the Valente brothers, they have this 753 code that
[02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:50.480]   was developed with some of the sort of samurai principles in mind. And all of my kids have
[02:53:50.480 --> 02:53:56.480]   memorized it, and they'll talk to me about it. Theo, he's eight years old. He'll be able to
[02:53:56.480 --> 02:54:05.120]   recite all 15. So, you know, benevolence and fitness and nutrition and flow and awareness
[02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:12.960]   and balance. And it's an unbelievable thing. And they'll actually integrate it into conversations
[02:54:12.960 --> 02:54:16.640]   where they'll talk about something that happened. Yeah, rectitude, courage.
[02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:22.240]   Benevolence, respect, honesty, honor, loyalty. So, this is not about jujitsu techniques or
[02:54:22.240 --> 02:54:26.400]   fighting techniques. This is about a way of life, about the way you interact with the world,
[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:31.760]   with other people. Exercise, nutrition, rest, hygiene, positivity, that's more on the physical
[02:54:31.760 --> 02:54:36.960]   side of things. Awareness, balance, and flow. It's the mind, the body, the soul, effectively,
[02:54:36.960 --> 02:54:40.800]   is how they break it out. And the kids can only advance and get their stripes if
[02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:46.640]   they really internalize this. They give examples of each of them. And my own kids will come home
[02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:52.160]   from school, and they'll tell me examples of how things happen that weren't aligned with the 753
[02:54:52.160 --> 02:54:59.440]   code. So, it's a framework, much like religion is in our house and can be for others. It's a
[02:54:59.440 --> 02:55:06.880]   framework to discuss things that happen in their life, large and small, and has been beautiful. So,
[02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:12.560]   I do think that body-mind connection is super strong in jujitsu.
[02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:18.560]   So, there's many things I love about the Valenti brothers, but one of them is how rooted it is in
[02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:23.200]   philosophy and history of martial arts in general. You know, a lot of places, you'll practice the
[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:29.760]   sport of it, maybe the art of it, but to recognize the history and what it means to be a martial
[02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:34.400]   artist broadly, on and off the mat, that's really great. And the other thing that's great is they
[02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:39.040]   also don't forget the self-defense route, the actual fighting routes. So, it's not just a sport,
[02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:44.000]   it's a way to defend yourself on the street in all situations. And that gives you a confidence
[02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:49.200]   in, just like you said, an awareness about your own body and awareness about others.
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:56.720]   It is, you know, sadly, we forget, but it's a world full of violence or the capacity for
[02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:02.560]   violence. So, it's good to have an awareness of that and a confidence how to essentially avoid it.
[02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:09.680]   100%. I've seen it with all of my kids and myself, how much they've benefited from it. But
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:16.080]   that self-defense component and the philosophical elements of either they,
[02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:25.920]   Pedro will often tell them about like wu-wei and sort of soft resistance and some of these
[02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:31.600]   sort of more Eastern philosophies that they get exposed to through their practice there that are
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:42.880]   sort of non-resistance that are beautiful and hard concepts to internalize as an adult, but especially
[02:56:42.880 --> 02:56:50.720]   when you're 12, 10, and 8, respectively. So, it's been an amazing experience for us all.
[02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:56.560]   I love people like Pedro because he's like finding books that are in Japanese and translating them
[02:56:56.560 --> 02:57:04.880]   to try to figure out the details of a particular history. He's like an ultra scholar of martial
[02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:09.280]   arts and I love that. I love when people give everything, every part of themselves to the thing
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:14.800]   they're practicing. You know, people have been fighting each other for a very long time. And I
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:21.360]   love from the Colosseum on, you can't fake anything, you can't lie about anything. It's
[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:27.840]   truly honest. You're there and you either win or lose. It's simple. And that's like, it's also
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:34.480]   humbling that the reality of that is humbling. And oftentimes in life, things are not that simple,
[02:57:34.480 --> 02:57:39.520]   not that black and white. So, it's nice to have that sometimes. That's the biggest thing I gained
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:45.680]   from jiu-jitsu is getting my ass kicked, which is the humbling. And it's nice to just get humbled in
[02:57:45.680 --> 02:57:50.000]   a very clear way. Sports in general are great for that. I think surfing probably, because I can
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:57.680]   imagine just, you know, yeah, face planting. Not being able to stay on the board, it's humbling.
[02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:03.360]   And the power of the wave is humbling. So, just like your mom, you're an adventurer.
[02:58:03.360 --> 02:58:08.480]   Are there, your bucket list is probably like 120 pages.
[02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:15.440]   There are things that just pop to mind that you're like thinking about, especially in the near
[02:58:15.440 --> 02:58:21.200]   future, just anything. Well, I hope it always is long. You know, I hope I've never like exhausted
[02:58:21.200 --> 02:58:25.360]   exploring all the things I'm curious about. I always tell my kids whenever they say, you know,
[02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:31.760]   "Mom, I'm bored," only boring people get bored. Like, there's too much to learn. There's too much
[02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:36.480]   to learn. So, I've got a long one. You know, I think obviously there are some like immediate,
[02:58:36.480 --> 02:58:41.840]   tactical, you know, interesting things that I'm doing. I'm incubating a bunch of businesses. I'm
[02:58:41.840 --> 02:58:47.440]   investing in a bunch of companies that hopefully I'll always can continue to do that. Some of the
[02:58:47.440 --> 02:58:52.320]   fun things I'm doing in real estate now. So, those are all on the list of things I'm passionate and
[02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:57.920]   excited about, you know, continuing to explore and learn. But in terms of the like the ones that are
[02:58:57.920 --> 02:59:03.200]   more pure sort of adventure or hobby, I think I'd like to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. Actually,
[02:59:03.200 --> 02:59:09.280]   I know I would. And the only thing keeping me from doing it in the short term is I feel like it'd be
[02:59:09.280 --> 02:59:14.640]   such a great experience to do with my kids. And I'd love to have that experience with them. I also
[02:59:14.640 --> 02:59:19.840]   told Arabella we were talking about this archery competition that happens in Mongolia and she loves
[02:59:19.840 --> 02:59:24.400]   horseback riding. So, I'm like I feel like that would be an amazing thing to experience together.
[02:59:24.400 --> 02:59:32.240]   I want to get barreled by a wave and learn how to play Texas Flood. I want to see the Northern
[02:59:32.240 --> 02:59:40.560]   Lights. Like I want to go and experience that. I feel like that would be really beautiful.
[02:59:40.560 --> 02:59:48.560]   I want to get my black belt like you have. I asked you, how long did it take? But so,
[02:59:48.560 --> 02:59:53.200]   I want to get my black belt in jiu-jitsu. That's going to be a longer-term goal but
[02:59:53.200 --> 03:00:00.640]   within the next decade. Yeah, a lot of things. You know, I'd love to go to space.
[03:00:00.640 --> 03:00:03.680]   Not just space. I think I'd love to go to the Moon.
[03:00:03.680 --> 03:00:05.760]   Like step on the Moon.
[03:00:05.760 --> 03:00:11.120]   Yeah. Or float, you know, in close proximity like that famous photo.
[03:00:11.120 --> 03:00:12.960]   Yeah. Just you and--
[03:00:13.680 --> 03:00:18.880]   The space suit. I feel like Mars is at this point in my life--
[03:00:18.880 --> 03:00:19.600]   A little too far away.
[03:00:19.600 --> 03:00:22.960]   Well, the Moon's like four days feels more manageable.
[03:00:22.960 --> 03:00:27.440]   I don't know. But the sunset on Mars is blue. It's the opposite color. I hear it's beautiful.
[03:00:27.440 --> 03:00:28.640]   Might be worth it. I don't know.
[03:00:28.640 --> 03:00:30.880]   You negotiate with Theo.
[03:00:30.880 --> 03:00:31.380]   Yeah.
[03:00:31.380 --> 03:00:35.280]   Let me know how it goes. Let me know how it goes.
[03:00:35.280 --> 03:00:38.640]   I think actually just even going to space where you can look back on Earth.
[03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:39.120]   Yeah.
[03:00:39.120 --> 03:00:42.400]   I think that just to see this little--
[03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:44.080]   Pale blue dot.
[03:00:44.080 --> 03:00:50.880]   Pale blue dot. Just all the stuff that ever happened in human civilization is on that.
[03:00:50.880 --> 03:00:56.640]   And to be able to look at it and just be in awe. I don't think that's a thing that will go away.
[03:00:56.640 --> 03:01:02.400]   I think being interplanetary, my hope is that that heightens for us how
[03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:13.360]   rare it is what we have. Like how precious the Earth is. I hope that it has that effect.
[03:01:13.360 --> 03:01:22.400]   Because I think there's a big component to interplanetary travel that kind of taps into
[03:01:22.400 --> 03:01:30.480]   this kind of manifest destiny inclination. Like the human desire to conquer territory and expand
[03:01:33.440 --> 03:01:40.160]   the footprint of civilization that sometimes feels much more rooted in like dominance and conquest
[03:01:40.160 --> 03:01:50.960]   than curiosity, wonder. And obviously, I think there's maybe an existential imperative for it
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:02:00.240]   at some point or a strategic and security one. But I hope that what feels inevitable
[03:02:01.040 --> 03:02:05.280]   at this moment. I mean, you know Elon Musk and what he's doing with SpaceX and
[03:02:05.280 --> 03:02:12.560]   Jeff Bezos and others. It feels like it's not an if, it's a when at this point. I hope it also
[03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:14.960]   underscores the need to protect what we have here.
[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:23.440]   Yeah. And I hope it's the curiosity that drives that exploration. And I hope the exploration
[03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:28.240]   will give us a deeper appreciation of the thing we have back home. And that Earth will always be
[03:02:28.240 --> 03:02:34.720]   home. And it's a home that we protect and celebrate. What gives you hope about the future
[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:38.560]   of this thing we have going on, human civilization, the whole thing?
[03:02:38.560 --> 03:02:43.680]   I think I feel a lot of hope when I'm in nature. I feel a lot of hope when
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:53.360]   I am experiencing people who are good and honest and pure and true and passionate. And
[03:02:54.560 --> 03:02:59.600]   that's not an uncommon experience. So those experiences give me hope.
[03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:01.280]   Yeah. Other humans, we're pretty cool.
[03:03:01.280 --> 03:03:09.920]   I love humanity. We're awesome. You know, not always, but we're a pretty good species.
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:14.240]   Yeah. For the most part, on the whole, we do all right. We do all right. We create some
[03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:19.280]   beautiful stuff. And I hope we keep creating. And I hope you keep creating. You've already
[03:03:19.840 --> 03:03:24.960]   done a lot of amazing things, build a lot of amazing things. And I hope you keep building
[03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:32.080]   and creating and doing a lot of beautiful things in this world. Ivanka, thank you so much for
