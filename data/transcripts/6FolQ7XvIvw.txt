[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   So, one of the tricky aspects of new technologies is that they can sometimes destabilize parts
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.280]   of our lives that we didn't even know exist and didn't even know were important.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.960]   We get this vague feeling of unease, but we don't really know where it's coming from.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.440]   We saw this, for example, in the world of digital knowledge work.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.320]   When personal computers and email and then mobile computing came along, it really changed
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.960]   the character of this type of work.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.800]   We became more busy and more frantic than ever before.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.960]   So we were assuming, given how much effort we were putting out, that we must somehow
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.400]   be more productive than we were before.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.120]   And yet, during that revolution, people had a sinking suspicion that something was wrong.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.760]   We couldn't necessarily point to all the new important things that we were accomplishing.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.920]   We were busier, but we didn't necessarily feel more productive.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.720]   So this was a case where it turned out that the real issue is there was two different
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.680]   types of work and we didn't know it.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.400]   We didn't have this vocabulary before.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.420]   But there was deep work, and then there was shallow work.
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.680]   And all of the new digital productivity tools that came in the 20th century, 21st century
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.040]   office were increasing the speed and quantity of shallow work, but were actually decreasing
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.120]   the amount of deep work.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:26.320]   And that is why we felt more busy than ever before, but weren't actually producing more.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.720]   So we didn't realize there was a difference between deep and shallow work.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.320]   And we didn't realize, therefore, that technology was subtly destabilizing this and making our
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.080]   lives worse because of it.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.680]   So today I want to talk about a similar problem in our personal lives.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.040]   As we begin to spend more and more time interacting with our phones, something that really picked
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.400]   up right around 2008, 2009, really hit its stride in 2012, it's easy to look at the positives,
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   right?
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.440]   We have more information, more connection, more distraction, more entertainment.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.840]   And all of this delivered in times that we would otherwise just be bored.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.960]   There's concerns, of course, about the specific things we were looking at on our phones.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.360]   But the idea was, look, if you can stay away from the toxic stuff, if you can stay away
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.720]   from the toxic social media threads, this was a net positive.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.620]   Life has just become more interesting than it was before.
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.280]   And yet, just like with digital knowledge work, we once again have this sinking feeling
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.000]   that something is off, that our lives are somehow not quite right in a world in which
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.200]   we're looking at our phones so much.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.000]   We can't say exactly why it's a problem, but people just feel uneasy when they survey the
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.920]   crowds around them and see everyone's face looking down.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.400]   So I want to get into that today, because I'm going to identify first what it is that
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.880]   we are losing in this current state of constant phone usage, the sort of hidden thing that
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.920]   was important to our lives that we didn't even realize that's being destabilized.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.520]   And once we realize what it is that we are losing, I'm going to give you concrete advice
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.800]   for how to regain it, and how to by doing so, regain the depth in your life.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.760]   All right, so let's get specific here.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.160]   What is it that we have to worry about when we look at our phones so much?
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.320]   Well, it's a specific cognitive state that I think most of us don't realize is important,
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.520]   and I'm going to call it the quiet brain.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.280]   This is the cognitive state when you are alone with your own thoughts and your observations
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.040]   of the world around you.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.160]   So when you're truly in a quiet brain state, it sort of feels like this.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.720]   The cacophonous chatter in your head has settled into a singular internal discussion or conversation.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.720]   Or exploration.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.440]   So you sort of have a single discussion happening in your brain.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.840]   What do I think about this?
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.000]   Or what happened there?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   What might be exciting to do next?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.360]   And this conversation in your brain will go quiet sometimes, and it'll just be you observing
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.160]   the world around you, seeing something around you, just fully observing, and then the conversation
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.440]   will come back again.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.440]   It's slow.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.440]   It's solemn.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.680]   Then it kind of dies off again as you notice something else.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.160]   So it's you, the world around you, and a sort of calm internal dialogue.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.080]   That's the quiet brain state.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.080]   Now here's the thing.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.120]   This is basically the default state for the human brain ever since we got to the stage
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.720]   of verbal language.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.400]   I think for most of our history, most of the time during the day, we were in a quiet brain
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400]   state.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.200]   We were sort of looking around as we were doing our daily labors, our daily journeys.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   We were seeing things.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   We were noticing things.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.620]   And then having these conversations internally come up, stick around for a while, then sort
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.000]   of die down again.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.680]   Not unlike being on the porch with an old friend in the rocking chairs, and as the evening
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.040]   wears on, you have conversation that drifts in and out, and sometimes you're just watching
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   the wind blow.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.820]   That was our default state.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.000]   Why is this quiet brain state important to humans?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.040]   Well there's three things I want to mention.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   First it's calming.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.280]   If you've had this state, you go for a long hike, and you don't have anything in your
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.080]   ears, and you see what's around you, and you'll think about something for a while, then back
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.000]   to observing what's around you, we feel restored.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.160]   To use a computer metaphor, it allows our brain to defragment, to sort of clean up what's
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.600]   going on inside.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.580]   I'm sure from a neurophysiological perspective, there's something to be said about chemicals
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.480]   being reset and rebalanced within our brains.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:32.880]   In my book, Digital Minimalism, I talked about the huge neural load required to do social
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.760]   interaction or to simulate other people's brains, and so to have relief from that, to
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.680]   just be alone with you and your own thoughts, this lets your brain actually catch a breather.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.120]   The second thing that happens during the quiet brain state is that you're able to make sense
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.000]   of yourselves and the world around you.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.580]   It is extended periods alone with your own thought where you process the information
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.480]   that you've taken in and make sense of it, that you integrate it into the multiple internal
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.520]   schemas stored inside your brain that you use to make sense of yourself and the world.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.680]   Maybe you had an experience recently that elicited pride or shame.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.200]   This lets you process that.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   What does that mean?
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   Why did that happen?
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.280]   What do I want to learn from this?
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.220]   What do I want to change going forward?
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.400]   It helps you better understand other people because you can sit there and really think
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.180]   about what's going on with this person?
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.040]   Why do they actually feel this way?
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.560]   What are the people that I'm leading or involved in a community with?
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.360]   What is it that they really need or what they're struggling with?
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.440]   It also helps you understand the world of ideas.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:37.580]   A complicated idea that you may be encountered in a podcast or a book isn't going to be accessibly
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.080]   integrated into your brain, something you can build on or apply to other things later
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.960]   in life until you give yourself time to actually let it bounce around, to think about it, to
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.240]   explore the different hard edges of this new complex shape and to integrate it into the
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.200]   folds of your brain.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.920]   So it's literally where you become smarter as well.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.000]   Finally, the quiet brain state is where you figure out what matters to you.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   What's important to you?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   What's not?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   What do you want in your life?
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.800]   What do you want to avoid?
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.680]   This requires discernment, by which I mean it requires you to actually pick up and notice
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.040]   these subtle feelings of resonance.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.560]   Something about what I'm seeing in this documentary right now just speaks to me.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.360]   There's something in there that's important.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.840]   Something about this experience over here is really turning me off.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.400]   I think there's something in this that I really don't like.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:32.060]   To really pull apart those threads and isolate them in a way that's usable, you need quiet
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.560]   time alone with your own thoughts.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.980]   I hear this a lot from people who are trying to follow my ideas and advice about cultivating
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.560]   a deeper life.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.640]   They'll realize, "I don't know what to aim for.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.640]   I don't know what it is I'm trying to get more of in my life and what it is I'm trying
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.820]   to reduce," and that's because they don't have enough quiet brain time to actually figure
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.820]   that out.
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:58.360]   The quieter your brain can get, the more sophisticated your understanding can become of what's important
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.240]   to you and what's not.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.280]   There's huge benefits to the quiet brain.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.280]   What is our current problem?
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:11.200]   Our current problem is this is exactly what is being subtly and quietly eliminated by
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   this behavior of constantly looking at our phones.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.800]   It's something we didn't realize was being destabilized, but it's a big source of that
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.160]   disquiet we feel about the constant companion model of looking at our phones every time
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.540]   we have some down time.
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.040]   Because we have mobile computing and high-speed ubiquitous wireless internet, for the first
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.980]   time in human history, we really can banish every moment in which we would have fallen
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.800]   into the quiet brain state, every moment of boredom, every moment of not having something
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.800]   to do.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.380]   We can listen to something or read something.
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:47.380]   We can have high-tech algorithms using lots of data on ourselves and our preferences show
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:52.140]   us like exactly what's going to be entertaining in the moment.
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.340]   It's like going from like a state of starvation to having an advanced snack machine that follows
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.860]   you around that gives you your very favorite junk food whenever you're hungry.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:06.140]   So this is the thing that we're quietly losing without realizing it by looking at our phones
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.140]   all the time.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:12.620]   This quiet brain state that we used to spend so much time in is being eliminated.
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.620]   We don't notice it.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.700]   We don't have the terminology for it.
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.700]   But it comes out when we just look around and say, "This doesn't feel right that we're
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.900]   all looking at our phones all the time."
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:27.220]   And it's not because what's really happening here is that we are quite literally not fully
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.860]   being human.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.420]   This quiet brain state, which is so core to the human experience, we're just getting rid
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.820]   of it without realizing it.
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.820]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.340]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:47.800]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:53.220]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.580]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.400]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.400]   Check it out.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.400]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.400]   All right.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.260]   So we want to do something about this.
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:11.020]   We want to reclaim more quiet brain time in our lives.
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:15.820]   Now, this is going to require not just making time for this, but becoming once again more
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.500]   comfortable with it.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.340]   This can be an uncomfortable state if you haven't been in there in a while.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.620]   We're not used to our own brain.
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.480]   We can get bored or antsy or afraid pretty easily.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.340]   So we have to reclaim our comfort with the quiet brain.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:33.060]   We have to carve out more time to actually have this cognitive state.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.540]   So I want to give you some concrete advice here.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:43.740]   I have four ideas, four concrete ideas, all of them built towards the same goal, the same
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:49.840]   goal of eliminating this constant companion relationship with your phone, where it's something
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:55.760]   that's always with you, that can deliver you incredibly appealing information distraction,
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.220]   and that you're in the habit of doing at even the slightest hint of not having directed
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.220]   work to do.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.220]   All right.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.100]   So we're going to break this constant companion model with your phone.
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.020]   We're going to do so with four pieces of advice.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:13.340]   All right, piece of advice number one, make your phone more boring.
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.340]   So I want you to take off your phone any app where someone makes more money the more time
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.940]   you use that app.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.200]   So this is a course including essentially every social media app.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:29.540]   It's also including, for example, addictive games, games you download for free.
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.300]   But the more you play it, the better it is for the company.
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.780]   This is also going to involve probably if you're using the YouTube app on your phone
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:42.340]   a lot too, and just sort of jumping around the recommendations on there when you're bored.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.140]   So what does this make your phone if you don't have those apps on it?
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.540]   It makes your phone exactly what it was when Steve Jobs first introduced the iPhone, when
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.180]   he first introduced the modern smartphone in his famous keynote in 2007.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.700]   What did Jobs outline in that original introduction of the iPhone?
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.460]   What did he outline as the phone's main uses?
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.940]   Communication, it's a really good interface for communicating with people, be it calls
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.620]   or text messages.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.300]   Audio, he really was pushing music, but of course now this is audio books and podcasts.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.940]   It's a fantastic audio player navigation, right?
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.940]   You have this fantastic map, so you never have to get lost again.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.380]   And looking up information relevant to what you're doing in the moment.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.200]   Where is the address of this restaurant we're looking for?
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.640]   What is the hours of this museum?
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   Is it still open?
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.440]   We want to figure out so we can decide whether we want to go there or not, right?
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.540]   Those were the original visions for the phone.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.780]   It's a fantastic vision.
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.420]   It makes it an incredibly useful part of your life, but it doesn't make it something that
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.660]   you would pull out at a moment's notice when distracted.
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.000]   So make your phone more boring.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.420]   Number two, practice the phone foyer method.
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.620]   I recommend this all the time.
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.180]   People do not want to do this.
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.820]   This is probably the scariest suggestion that I will make here, but I have to tell you it
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.460]   works.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.780]   It really will change your relationship with your phone.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.540]   I know it sounds scary, but it really will.
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.620]   All right, for people who don't know it, here is how it works.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.320]   When at home, you keep your phone plugged in in a set location, not in your pocket with
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.800]   you.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.840]   So I call it the phone foyer method because if you have a house, maybe you have a foyer
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.620]   near the front door where you put your keys, it's a great place to plug it in.
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.160]   If you don't have a foyer, it could be, for example, in your kitchen or in your home office.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.660]   You keep it plugged in when you're at home.
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.820]   If you need to look something up, you go to where your phone is plugged in, you look it
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.820]   up.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.820]   If you need to text someone, you go to your phone and you text them there.
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.160]   If you need to call someone, you go to the phone and you call them there.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.860]   If you need to have a back and forth conversation with someone, you know, you're going to have
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.420]   to sit there and do it where the phone is plugged in.
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:47.820]   So you're not eliminating any use of the phone, but you are eliminating the immediate access.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.660]   So this means when you're at the table, when you're eating breakfast, when you're watching
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.020]   TV or a movie with your family, the phone is not there to alleviate any boredom.
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.180]   It's in the other room, it's plugged in.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.780]   And so you have to just stay with whatever you're doing.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.460]   You sit down to read a book, you can't look at your phone real quick when you have those
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.460]   little moments of boredom.
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.140]   Your phone is plugged in, in the other room.
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.380]   Now what about audio when you're doing chores around the house?
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.860]   Well, you use, you know, wireless earbuds, it's fine.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.380]   Someone once said, "Well, wait a second, my house is kind of large and if my phone is
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:25.380]   plugged in over here and I'm doing the dishes over here, my earbuds don't reach."
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.380]   Okay, fine.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.100]   Change where you plug it in if you need to, to do a chore in another part of your house.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.120]   The key thing is not to have it on your person.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.500]   This is really effective because it gets to the core of the constant companion model,
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.940]   which is the default knee jerk reaction of bored, pull it out, bored, pull it out.
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.580]   You eliminate that ability, your brain pretty quickly learns to make that association less
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:53.060]   strong and that urge, that dopamine-driven urge of, "I'm going to feel good in a second
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.980]   here when I look at this distraction," that will begin to dissipate.
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.980]   So you really have to practice the phone for your method, even though I know you don't
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:00.980]   want to.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:06.180]   All right, my third piece of advice, this is kind of controversial as well, stop reading
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.700]   so much stuff on your phone.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:13.020]   All right, I love written material, but I don't want you to think of your phone as a
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:17.740]   place that always has interesting things you can scroll through and read when you're bored.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.860]   So there's a couple of things you can do to actually implement this advice.
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.900]   First of all, I love email newsletters.
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.820]   You should have those all filtered, if you're using something like Gmail, filtered to a
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:27.820]   particular label.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:32.020]   And then what you can do is every once in a while, go through those newsletters.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:37.060]   And these can include, by the way, newsletters, daily news roundups from the major news sources
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.060]   you follow.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:43.180]   So we're talking not just independent information, but major news as well.
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:48.700]   Send the interesting articles either to a reading app, or there's a cool app someone
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.900]   was showing me the other day that can send articles to your Kindle.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.660]   Send to Kindle.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:58.580]   So either clip it in a reading app, or maybe send it directly to a Kindle.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.140]   Then to read these articles, you can, if you send them to your Kindle, you can read them
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.540]   right there on your Kindle where you have no other distractions.
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:10.580]   If you sent them to a reader app like Pocket, you could use like an iPad that has that app,
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.580]   it syncs up with it.
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.860]   And that's like what you use to read the articles you sent over there, right?
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.300]   So you're not, it's not on your phone, it's on a separate device.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.780]   And now you can read these interesting articles that you got digitally delivered in times
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.300]   in place that you've set aside for this.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.460]   Like I've talked about the Sunday morning ritual of going to a coffee shop with your
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.180]   Kindle or iPad to catch up on articles.
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.140]   Or it could be something you do right before dinner, or you do at night in your study,
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.340]   but you're not giving up on this miraculous element of the internet, which is there's
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.020]   more information for more interesting people that's more accessible, but you're taking
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.020]   it off of your phone.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.820]   Because again, this is all about making your phone no longer this totemic source of distraction
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.260]   that like everything is on here, if I pick it up, that's going to make my life less
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.260]   boring.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:00.660]   Finally, you have to actually just practice this boredom.
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:05.220]   And by boredom, I mean, being alone with your own thoughts, you have to get used to that.
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.900]   This will take some time, but you have to get used to that.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:11.860]   Now I recommend often on the show, a pretty specific rhythm for this, a small session
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:15.620]   every day where you go and do something with nothing in your ear and nothing in your hand,
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:21.460]   we're talking about you run into run an errand, or you go to buy some coffee, and you don't
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.460]   bring your phone with you.
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.900]   Or if you do have your phone with you, it's in your bag and it's turned off.
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:29.700]   It's just every day, you get a little bit more comfort with just my brain is all I have
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.100]   to entertain me.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.500]   Once a week, then I want you to do a longer session, like a long walk or a hike, or you
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.740]   mow your whole yard or something, a longer session alone with your own thoughts.
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:43.940]   For now, you can really get used to that sort of, I bring up a conversation, I can get bored
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.740]   with it, it's just looking around for a while, another conversation comes up that sort of
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:52.500]   we're on the porch, and there's just some moments of silence type calm and peace.
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.380]   So a short session every day of boredom, a long session every week.
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:01.740]   All right, so this is my four pieces of advice to summarize, make your phone more boring,
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:08.060]   practice the phone for your method, stop reading on your phone, practice boredom.
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:13.280]   You do these things and you can reclaim the quiet mind as a state that you not only go
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.220]   into more frequently, but that you're much more comfortable being in.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:23.740]   It will take about four to six weeks of practicing this advice before this becomes natural, before
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.940]   you really begin to reap the benefits and not just feel the difficulties of it.
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.140]   But those benefits are worth it.
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:36.980]   It really is like your life has been turned from black and white to technicolor.
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:41.700]   It's just it's slower and more vivid and more rich and more intellectually interesting.
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.080]   Your sense of yourself as a person and what's happening in the world around you and what's
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.420]   important to you, all of this will become sharper.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.380]   You will quite literally feel more human.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:56.580]   So this advice is hard, but I think it's worth giving a try because the quiet brain is not
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:01.940]   a state that we should be comfortable fully abandoning from the human experience.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.100]   All right, so there we go, Jesse, quiet brain.
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.380]   You know where this came from actually was working on my deep life book.
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.380]   Oh, really?
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.380]   Up here.
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.380]   Yeah.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.540]   Up here on vacation is where it kind of became, I began thinking more and more about the importance
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:19.260]   of the quiet brain and to discern like what you want to do with your deep life.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:24.020]   And so I've been kind of been grappling it up here in this quiet, this quiet undisclosed
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.020]   location.
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.420]   So I thought I would, I would try out some of the ideas.
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.300]   I have two questions for the no reading on your phone.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.740]   Is that due to the temptation to look at other things?
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.740]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.740]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:41.880]   And also just, uh, I want your phone to seem like the Steve jobs, 2007 device, very utilitarian.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:48.420]   So the more you have sort of just like generic button pressing, nice distraction on the phone,
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.480]   the more you're going to be tempted to just, this is what I do when I'm bored.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.400]   Um, so, so a lot of people will maybe get off to like I'm on Instagram or Tik TOK on
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.880]   the phone, but in this have so many like news feeds and recommended articles, uh, and it
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:06.760]   can, it can take them down that same pathway of just quick distraction.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.760]   So you're going to read, read.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.760]   Um, the other thing I would add, you know, I, I had this
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.760]   note.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.440]   I'll add, I'll add one more note to the stop reading on your phone.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.400]   I'll add a little addendum, read more physical stuff too.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.720]   And we might call this the Rory Gilmore method is a Gilmore girls reference.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.720]   She always had books with her.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.360]   So consider always having a physical book with you as well.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.960]   So in moments of boredom, it is a physical book and not your phone that you turn to.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.680]   I think that's also a fantastic, a fantastic way to disassociate again, your phone as like
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.560]   a distraction machine.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:46.560]   Um, and then in terms of the larger session every week, I guess golfing will count, right?
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.280]   If you didn't have your phone, you're like carrying your bag and walking.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.280]   I think it'd be great.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.280]   You're golfing.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.040]   Uh, you know, you're there with your buddy, you're talking, you're listening, you're thinking
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.040]   about what you're doing.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:03.240]   You're, I think there's a reason why, uh, people today really like golf.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.320]   Like one of the benefits they get from it is like, it's some of their only quiet brain
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.320]   time.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:14.200]   So yeah, you're justified, Jesse, with your, your, uh, outrageous amount of time you spend
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.200]   playing golf.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   Think about my swing and cry.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.200]   Exactly.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.560]   Just want you to sit there and just contemplate what's wrong with your swing.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:27.960]   All right, well, we've got a great group of questions here, uh, dealing with this and
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.560]   quiet and solitude and distraction work, all sorts of cool stuff.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:37.680]   But before we get there, let's, uh, quickly hear from one of the sponsors.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:43.120]   So in particular, I want to talk about a new sponsor of this show.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:48.120]   And that is indeed look, we're all driven by the search for better.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.280]   That's what we talk about here on the show all the time, but when it comes to hiring,
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.360]   the best way to search for our can it isn't to search at all.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.360]   You don't want to search.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.840]   You want to be matched and you can do this with indeed, right?
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.640]   So if you're growing out a company and a lot of our listeners are right there, they're
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:09.080]   growing out a side hustle into a full-time business to help them fulfill their vision
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.560]   of a deep life.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.160]   Hiring is going to be a really big piece of this.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.960]   And if you need to hire, you need indeed.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.680]   Indeed is your matching and hiring platform.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:24.360]   It has over 350 million global monthly visitors according to indeed data and a matching engine
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.980]   that helps you find quality candidates fast.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:34.200]   Look used ditch your busy work use indeed for the scheduling, the screening, the messaging,
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.600]   all the things you need to go through the hiring process.
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.160]   Indeed is going to make this easier.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.400]   I have a chapter in my book, slow productivity, where I say, look, you need to spend more
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:48.240]   money if it will make your life easier professionally.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.600]   This is a great example of that.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:54.040]   If you need to hire, don't let this become what I call a task engine.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.000]   Instead of little steps that you have to figure out from scratch, use a service like indeed.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.320]   It takes care of the details.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.880]   It helps you match the right people and handle all the steps along the way of the hiring
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.680]   process.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.760]   So here's the good news.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:15.040]   Listeners of the show will get a $75 sponsored job credit to help get your jobs more visibility.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:19.920]   All you have to do is go to indeed.com/deep.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:25.200]   Let's go to indeed.com/deep right now and support our show by saying you heard about
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:34.400]   indeed on this podcast, indeed.com/deep terms and conditions apply, need to hire, you need
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.400]   indeed.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.880]   I also want to talk about our friends at notion.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:47.200]   Notion is a place where any team can write, plan, organize and rediscover the joy of play.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:53.520]   It's a workspace design, not just for making progress, but getting inspired.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:58.680]   Look we live in an era of information overload, all sorts of information you need to run your
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.240]   business or to run your life.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.240]   Notion helps you make sense of this information.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.400]   One of the ways we used to use notion, for example, was to keep track of our ad reads
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.760]   like I'm doing right now.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:15.480]   Our ad agency actually built out a really cool notion workspace where we could see the
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.240]   information, all the information relevant to these ads in many different forms.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.640]   We could look at a calendar, for example, a calendar view and say, okay, what are the
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.000]   ads for this particular episode?
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.400]   But then we could click on one of those ads and say, why don't you show me all of the
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.840]   ads that we've done for that particular advertiser?
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.400]   There is the system that they set up with notion made it easy for us to enter an information.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.200]   Oh, here's the link to the episode.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.940]   Here's the timestamps.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:45.580]   This information workspace that we created for managing ads just made this so much easier
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.440]   than trying to just throw shared documents back around and send emails.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.880]   You can really do almost anything with your information using notion.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:58.400]   It is also more recently added more and more AI powered tools.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.560]   Now meetings can be summarized, docs can be easily found.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.960]   Questions about the information in your workplace can be asked of the AI and it will give you
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.600]   an answer right there.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:14.400]   So it is made notions already best in class information management, even more powerful.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.120]   Whether you're a fortune, a fortune 500 company or freelance designer, starting a new startup
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.880]   or student juggling classes and clubs, notion will make it easier.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.960]   So try notion for free when you go to notion.com/cow.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:33.320]   That's all lowercase letters, notion.com/cow and start turning ideas into actions.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.240]   And when you use our link, you're supporting my show.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.800]   So go to notion.com/cow.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:44.280]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.280]   Sounds good.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.440]   First questions from triple a is walking meditation an important skill or is it used as a tool
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.880]   to learn to focus?
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.260]   Oh, it's a good question.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:26:01.560]   Triple a because people ask about this a lot using traditional meditation techniques to
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.720]   help improve their ability to focus.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.840]   So walking meditation is a traditional technique.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.540]   It comes, for example, out of mindfulness meditation.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:15.180]   So one of the ways to do mindfulness meditation is to go on a walk so that your body's in
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.180]   physical motion.
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:22.140]   And then during traditional walking meditation, you just try to keep your attention just on
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:26.160]   your thoughts without engaging them, just like you do when you're sitting doing mindfulness
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.160]   meditation.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.160]   But some people, myself included, find it easier to be moving.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:36.520]   It also just gives you sort of more to look at, makes it sort of easier to get that distance
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.720]   from your inner dialogue.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:44.760]   So walking meditation is great for the benefits you get from traditional mindfulness meditation.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:50.920]   However, if you want to learn to focus better, my advice is always practice directly focusing
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.560]   better.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.000]   Don't look for a transference of ability from related tasks.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.860]   It's usually better just to practice directly the thing you want to be better at.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.840]   So if you want to be better at focusing on your work, let's devise routines to practice
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.460]   focusing better on your work.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.040]   Let's directly practice what we want to do.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.940]   There's two things I usually recommend here, two practice regimes I usually recommend for
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.200]   getting better at focusing on your work.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.420]   One is interval training.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.180]   So use an actual timer.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.000]   You can start at 20 minutes if you're new to this.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.960]   And start the timer and focus on what you're doing really, really intensely.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.800]   If your attention wanders, bring it back to the work you're doing and try to focus really
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   intensely.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.280]   Remember, you only have to do this for the time or duration, so it doesn't seem open-ended
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.680]   and impossible.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:45.240]   Also, that voice that says like, "Well, why don't we take a break now?" is much more easy
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.000]   to diffuse when you're doing interval training because you can say, "No, the break is going
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.240]   to come when this timer's over."
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.720]   So we don't have to have a negotiation about whether or not to take a break now.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.080]   It's in 10 minutes.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.400]   We can wait 10 minutes.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.760]   Now, the key to interval training is if you actually go and look at something else, you
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.440]   look at the web, you look at your phone, you have to restart the timer, so there's some
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.360]   stakes there as well.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.320]   And what you do is you start with a time that's a little bit of a stretch, and then after
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.760]   you get more comfortable with that time, you increase it by 10 minutes.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.080]   So 20 minutes, let's just go all in, focus.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:25.480]   It's really hard, but I can do 20 minutes because I'm going to be embarrassed if I can't.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.720]   Once it's no longer so hard, I make that 30 minutes, so maybe that's like a week later.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.640]   Now I'm doing these like 30-minute chunks until that's pretty comfortable, then I make
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.640]   it 40-minute chunks.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:37.440]   And if you can get to about 90 minutes to two hours of being able to really focus hard,
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.160]   there you go.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.020]   You've got a sort of A+ focus ability.
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:45.440]   So interval training directly increases your ability to focus on the type of stuff you
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.120]   need to focus on.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.440]   The other thing I recommend, and this might be where your connection or mix-up around
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:57.240]   walking meditation and focus might have come from, is what I call productive meditation.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:02.240]   This does involve walking, but it's not walking meditation.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.640]   So what you do with productive meditation is you go for a long walk and try to make
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:11.640]   progress on a single professional problem, the type of thing you want to get better at.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.000]   Make progress on a single professional problem only in your head.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.120]   And when your attention wanders from that problem, which it will do, you just bring
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.400]   your attention back to that problem and keep trying to make progress.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.320]   Do this with your phone not with you or turned off in your bag so it's just you alone with
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.440]   your own thoughts trying to make progress on a professional problem.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.760]   This will be hard at first.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.080]   Your mind will wander a lot.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.600]   In fact, I can guarantee one thing your mind, if you're new to this, will almost certainly
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.320]   do is try to write emails.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.080]   I don't know why this is the case, but knowledge worker after knowledge worker reports this
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.080]   to me.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.480]   When they first try productive meditation, the first thing their mind tries to do is
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.240]   wander from the problem at hand and think about emails it needs to write and it starts
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.920]   writing the text in your brain.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.920]   That's fine.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.760]   Just notice it and bring your attention back to the problem.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.600]   Eventually you'll get better at this.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.840]   You'll be able to keep your mind's eye more stable and you'll be able to better take advantage
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.240]   of your working memory resources, meaning you'll have more things you can keep held
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:16.480]   in your mind's eye to reference while you're trying to make mental progress on your problem.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.120]   Productive meditation is hard, but it makes you really good at focus.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:25.360]   I spent my two years as a postdoc at MIT doing a large quantity of productive meditation
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.640]   and it really made a big difference on my ability to actually grapple with problems.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:33.920]   So if you're going to become better at focusing, practice getting better at focusing.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:39.400]   If you want the benefits of mindfulness meditation, practice mindfulness meditation.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.920]   But I wouldn't depend too much on transference from one to the other.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.180]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.400]   Next question's from Tired New Dad.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:55.000]   I'm a new dad, however I want to change my job and this will require that I get new certifications.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.520]   But this all takes time outside of work, which I feel like I have none.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:03.080]   How can I advance my career in this new period of my life?
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.380]   Don't advance your career in this particular period of your life, right?
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:13.360]   It's possible, Tired New Dad, that you're having a bit of a panic reaction.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.980]   This big disruptive thing has happened.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.180]   It's scary and disoriented.
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:22.180]   There's a baby in the house and it's like everything feels out of control and you're
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:27.600]   fighting with your wife about who's doing what and it all seems kind of weird and scary
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.600]   and you're worried.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.680]   A big change can feel like this is going to make me feel better.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.320]   Changes we think make us feel better.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.060]   There's an excitement in doing something new.
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.280]   We want to change something up.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:48.080]   It's a way to regain autonomy and a way to seek the chemical soothing of positive change.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.120]   However, this is not the time to do that.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:56.220]   This is the time to make your side hustle, your side project, where you're putting your
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.220]   extra energy.
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:01.060]   All of that should be focused on your new kid and your wife.
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.060]   How do we get through this?
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.320]   How do we make this as reasonable as possible?
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.560]   How do I prevent my partner from going insane?
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.260]   How can I be as useful as possible?
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.960]   This is what you should be focused on at least in this period where you're tired because
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.440]   you have a very new baby.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.040]   That's what I'm going to suggest.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.720]   Now this idea of changing your job, when do you get back to this?
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.960]   You get back to this after what I call the new baby stabilization point.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:29.280]   I've been through this three times and so I learned through experience that in that
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.160]   early period of everything is up in the air because we have an infinite home, the thing
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.800]   I would look forward to to calm myself is knowing you're going to get to what I call
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:46.720]   the new baby stabilization point, which is when you first get into a sustainable, stable,
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:53.760]   ongoing routine with the child, which usually means maternity and paternity leaves are over.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.920]   The childcare situation is figured out.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.780]   Like, okay, here's the daycare, here's the nanny, whatever it is, and it's like, great,
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.600]   we have the sustainable setup.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.600]   We dropped the kid off here at this time, we pick them up here, here's what we do with
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.000]   our schedules to make this work.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.760]   So you're no longer in a period of temporarily facing a disruption, but you've come back
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.880]   to like, okay, this is what we're going to do for the next year or two.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.520]   That's when you can start thinking again about side projects, right?
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.440]   Because now you're no longer all hands on deck, you're back to like, okay, here's our
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.760]   new stable configuration.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.760]   We have a new stable configuration for our family.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.480]   Now I can actually step back and say, what changes do I want to make?
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.480]   All right.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.920]   So that's the way I would think about this is until you're at the new baby stabilization
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:42.100]   point and just focus on the new baby and your wife right now, like that's where you want
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.100]   to be.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.360]   That's where you want to be focusing.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:49.560]   The other recommendation I'm going to give here is, you know, if this is your first kid,
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.640]   now you have a family that's different than let's say, even just being married, you have
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:58.880]   a family, which means your lifestyle centric planning from which any decision like to change
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.240]   your job should be, uh, stemming from, it should be working backwards from a lifestyle
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.120]   vision, not working forward towards a singular goal.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.800]   This lifestyle vision needs to now be fully shared.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.520]   You and your wife need to sit down and really think through what do we want our lifestyle
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.280]   to be like the next few years, five years from now, 10 years from now, you have to be
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.400]   on the same page.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:22.840]   All these decisions need to be decisions made to help the family's vision.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:28.960]   Very important that you do not fall into, uh, I, me, the sort of singular, what do I
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.060]   want in my job?
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.080]   Uh, I want to react to this part of my life being harder by being able to do this other
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.480]   part of my life more.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.960]   It's my turn to make this more what I want to be.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.280]   Everything now needs to be family focused as the family lifestyle that you're working
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.440]   backwards from, not just what you think might be interesting or what might be best for your
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.440]   career.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.480]   So there's a, there's a real change that happens in the air when you go from a couple to a
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.480]   family.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.600]   All right.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.040]   I really do remember that after the first kid, Jesse, I got really good at it.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:02.160]   It really was call me being like, yeah, it's going to be six months from now.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.160]   We will have it.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.680]   We'll be in the stable routine.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.760]   And once we're in a sustainable, stable routine, everything's possible again.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.160]   And so don't worry about the moment being really chaotic.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.520]   It was always knowing like that's not that far in the future.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.840]   I remember that very clearly.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.840]   All right.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.840]   Who do we got next?
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.840]   All right.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.840]   Next question is from Thomas.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.600]   In a few months, I'm taking on the role of our customer support manager as she goes on
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.240]   maternity leave for at least six months.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.520]   This will add a lot more admin work.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.280]   Normally I can work in solitude on one to two tasks per day.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:39.040]   Should I treat this period as an intense season from which I will cool off significantly afterwards
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.880]   as in your soul productivity book, or should I be more focusing on your work management
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.840]   suggested suggestions from a world without email?
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.160]   I'm going to suggest both.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.160]   Right.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.600]   So you should do you should do both of these things.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.600]   One.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.600]   Yes.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:59.200]   This is a temporary season that's more intense because you're taking on this extra role,
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.320]   but then that role is going to go away.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:08.520]   So it is helpful psychologically to say my expectations for the bigger, deeper projects
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:13.720]   that I execute in isolation and solitude, that my expectations are reduced for this
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   period.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.520]   I'm going to reduce my load of big projects.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:23.160]   I'm going to dedicate more time to accommodate this new administrative role.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.160]   And I know this will end.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.560]   And when it ends, I'll sort of take a breather and then go back to the way I was working
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.800]   before, which was which was slower and more individualistic.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.140]   So, yes, I think you should do that.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:37.880]   At the same time, I think you should also be applying the type of thinking that's in
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.440]   my book A World Without Email about structuring this new administrative work with systems
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.600]   and processes to to minimize the negative impact it has on your life.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.280]   You want to do both.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:52.520]   I want to build systems around it and I want to adjust my expectations for this period.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.760]   You want to do both at the same time.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:37:02.080]   Now the cool thing about this being a temporary assignment, you are doing like a favor for
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.680]   your company by doing this, right?
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.760]   You're helping them out by taking on this extra role.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.680]   I bet they're not paying you more.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.320]   So they're really grateful that you're doing this.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.560]   This means because it's not your full time job, you can get away with being more more
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.180]   annoying about how you structure this work.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:22.360]   You can get away with having pretty extremes like, look, here's like the systems and processes
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.440]   I'm going to need if I'm going to do this and I'm going to still be able to do my other
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.440]   job.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.720]   I'm going to have to really structure the hell out of this.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.080]   You get away with a lot more than if they like hired you just to do this job and like,
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.840]   you know, chill out with all this Cal Newport stuff.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.200]   You can you can get away with some bigger, more intense system.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.760]   So like, let me suggest a few things you might think about here.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.920]   Colleague office hours.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.480]   Every day or every other day, here's an hour in which my door is open and I have a virtual
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:52.040]   meeting room turned on and a phone on and you defer as many back and forth interactions
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.160]   with your colleagues as possible to the office hours like, yeah, that's a great point.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.160]   Grab me at my next office hours.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.080]   We'll get into it, right?
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.080]   Make those demands.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.040]   That's going to cut a lot of the back and forth communication down.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.040]   Ticketing systems.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.240]   You're in customer support.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.400]   Use ticketing systems or simulated ticketing systems that I talked about in a world without
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.200]   email for non-customer facing things as well.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.200]   All right.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.520]   Yeah, you did make this request to me.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.640]   You can see it status.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.640]   Here it is.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.920]   It's in a Trello board or in a free ticketing system somewhere.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.760]   I'll update you when I get to this.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.480]   I'm going to pull tickets off of here.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.840]   So you're structuring information.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.720]   You're making status of information transparent.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.160]   All this again reduces unscheduled back and forth communication.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.480]   If you have a team, use docket clearing meetings to take care of lots of little things so it
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.080]   doesn't just unfold on Slack channels.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.320]   In fact, you should even demand.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.280]   We don't use Slack.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:46.040]   Or if we use it, it's when we're having a meeting on Slack at a certain time, but it's
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.520]   not something that otherwise I'm going to monitor.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.680]   Definitely structure the time you use for working on this particular job.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.080]   You say, look, I have two jobs.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.500]   Here are the hours I work on this one.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.980]   So like the first three hours of every day is working on my other job.
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:03.320]   The next three hours is like for meetings and everything else for this other job.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:07.320]   And so when you're scheduling meetings for the new temporary job, you say, yeah, I spend
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.560]   half the day on this job, the second half of the day.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.960]   So no morning is available.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:16.680]   Again, you can get away with this stuff because you have agreed to take on these extra obligations
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.680]   for your company.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.720]   So you have more wiggle room here to structure your time.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:24.520]   And finally have communication protocols for things that have to happen again and again.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:28.480]   Again, you have to read a world without email to get the details on that.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:33.220]   But for types of work that happen again and again, figure out this is how we talk about
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.220]   it.
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.220]   This is how requests come in.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.220]   This is how we keep track of requests.
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.020]   Here's how we update the status of things.
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.680]   Take the time to build protocols around these.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.360]   Do not just let things come with haphazard unscheduled messaging back and forth.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.360]   All right.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.860]   So lower your expectations, put a temporary hold on almost everything else you're working
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:51.860]   on.
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.520]   Make this reasonable.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.440]   But then it's structured the hell out of the work anyways.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.400]   Those two together I think will make this completely survivable.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.140]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.000]   Next question's from Scott.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.120]   My son is two years away from university.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.980]   He's also a highly competitive judo athlete.
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:14.040]   Can he start to implement some of your strategies such as weekly planning, multi-scale planning
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:19.960]   to help him manage his time more effectively and balance the priorities of school and judo?
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:27.520]   Yeah, students can definitely gain massive advantages by being more aware about how they
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.040]   schedule their time and activities.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:34.400]   It can almost be because there's so little of this happening among young people, so like
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.600]   at the high school level or the college level.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.880]   It's almost like a superpower.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.880]   If you have even rudimentary control over your time and schedule, it prevents deadline
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:48.440]   pile-ups, it prevents you having to work late at night, it gives you a realistic assessment
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.880]   of your actual workload so you can make reductions or figure out what's really messing up with
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.360]   your time.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.680]   It's a fantastic, I very much suggest it.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:01.640]   I have two different books that give advice specifically on students doing this.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.120]   First is How to Become a High School Superstar.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:10.200]   The part one playbook in that book specifically gets into how a high school-age student could
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.320]   manage their time and schedule.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.640]   The second book is How to Become a Straight-A Student.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:22.920]   That book gives advice for university students on how they should manage their time and obligations.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:27.040]   How to Become a High School Superstar sort of simplifies the straight-A student advice
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.520]   a little bit to make it more appropriate for a younger student.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.200]   However, if you have an advanced student with a complicated schedule, either of those books
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:40.120]   I think you'll find the student-focused time management advice really useful.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.280]   So yes, students should care about this.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.800]   It is going to look different than what I would do as a middle-aged professional with
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.520]   five jobs, but scheduling makes a difference.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.400]   Speaking of which, I had a little note about this.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.400]   How to Win at College, Jesse.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:00.640]   My very first book from 2005 was featured on the Fox News website the other day.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.640]   Oh, really?
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.640]   It's interesting.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.680]   A, blast of a past and not the place you think about when you think about college advice
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:07.680]   books.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:13.240]   But I guess they had a roundup of books to get for students, and it was one of the books.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:19.360]   So hey, it's good to see my very first book has made a reappearance.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.360]   That's good.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.360]   A lot of fondness.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.880]   A lot of fondness for that book.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.880]   How to Win at College.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:24.880]   All right.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.360]   Oh, we've got a Slow Productivity Corner coming up.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.360]   Is that right?
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.360]   Yes, we do.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.360]   All right.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:35.600]   I may be separated by many miles from the HQ right now, but I think I can still rock
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.080]   out to the Slow Productivity Corner theme music.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:48.600]   Let's hear that musical interlude.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:52.420]   So if you're new to the show, the Slow Productivity Corner is where we do a question each week
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:58.500]   that's relevant to my new book, Slow Productivity and the Lost Art of Accomplishment Without
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.500]   Burnout.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:04.280]   If you have not yet checked out Slow Productivity, but you do like the type of advice you hear
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.440]   on the show, you've got to read the book.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.360]   You can find it anywhere books are sold or find out more at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:16.520]   All right, Jesse, what is our Slow Productivity Corner question of the week?
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.500]   It comes from Star to Slacker.
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.540]   My colleagues are great at pseudo productivity and get praised for busyness, whereas I'm
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:29.280]   taking my time doing less and trying to be Newportonian and seem to be viewed as a slacker
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.640]   rather than a star.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.880]   I try to focus on three big projects over a quarter semester while my colleagues did
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:41.740]   10 to 15 smaller ones, and the perception is that the people who do more are inherently
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:45.980]   more valuable and get raises, promotions, and more prestige.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:49.320]   How can I do less when my colleagues are getting ahead for doing more?
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:55.160]   All right, well, there's two approaches here, right?
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:00.760]   One is just to recalibrate what you think the right size is for a project, okay?
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:07.560]   Because the advice from Slow Productivity is actually agnostic to some degree about
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.680]   the size of projects you're working on.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:16.240]   The advice says don't do too many projects at the same time because this creates too
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.860]   much administrative overhead.
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:21.340]   It adds up to be too much, and then you can't get anything done, so you want to not have
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.720]   too many concurrent projects, regardless of how big they are.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.280]   Two, it says to take your time, right?
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.600]   So this might be the place where you're thinking about.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:35.000]   So give projects the time required to do them well, but also have more cycles throughout
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   the year.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.160]   Have busy periods and less busy periods, and then three is like obsess over quality.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.360]   Do things really well.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.840]   You want to increasingly sort of become better at what you do.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:46.960]   All right.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:51.740]   These are somewhat agnostic to project size, so it's possible, this is option one, it's
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:57.120]   possible that in your particular workplace, the appropriate size of project they want
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.240]   people working on is relatively small.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:04.960]   If that's the case, work on smaller projects, but still use the rules of slow productivity.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.360]   Only do a couple at a time.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.920]   Make sure you have variability, like you have more intense periods and less intense periods,
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.720]   and really focus on doing each of them well.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.680]   Like try to get better at them so you're doing them at a higher level of quality.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:21.080]   So you could just work on smaller projects, but by applying the rules of slow productivity,
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:25.140]   not get overloaded doing it, and really begin to do really well on them.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.720]   Your other option, if you say, "No, no, no, what I want to do is work on a smaller
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:35.040]   number of projects that have way more impact," you got to roll the dice on that.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.500]   You would have to roll the dice on that.
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:41.600]   What I mean by that is if you're in an organization where people are doing lots of little things,
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:47.240]   pseudo productivity, and it's not really that valuable, but it's safe, and it's attention
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.740]   catching that you're just like, "No, I'm working on these really big initiatives,"
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.600]   you have to actually put the chips down on the table.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:57.520]   This is what I mean by roll the dice, and make it clear, "I am doing less things right
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.880]   now, but the thing I'm working on is really important.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.080]   Hold me to that.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:08.800]   My claim I'm making is the small number of things I'm doing really well is going to make
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.600]   a huge difference.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:14.280]   So let's check back in in three months, and I'll prove that to you."
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.520]   So that's where this is the gamble, because it actually has to make a difference.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:21.240]   If you want to say, "No, I'm saying no to more of these smaller things.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:29.600]   I am stepping out of the pseudo productivity buzz to focus on a smaller number of things,"
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.480]   there's a necessary element of accountability.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.560]   In the book, I talk about this as the trade-off.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:35.800]   You're trading the sort of accessibility.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.760]   Just give me any work, I'll get it done for accountability.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.600]   I'm not going to do that, but you have to hold me accountable, and if the stuff I produce
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:46.740]   is not great, if the stuff I produce really doesn't move the needle, then it's going to
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:50.760]   be unavoidable, and I'm going to have to go back to working the other way, or maybe even
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.640]   lose my job.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.040]   So you have these two options.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.480]   You either recalibrate your project size, like, "Great, I'm working on smaller projects,
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:03.960]   but in a slowly productive way," or you roll the dice and say, "I'm pitching to you, my
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:09.320]   company, to be different than other people here, and the only way to succeed with that
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:14.940]   is to really lean into the obsession over quality aspect of slow productivity and deliver
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.080]   the hell out of what you're doing."
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:21.160]   And it's so valuable what you're doing, and so skilled, they're like, "We need this."
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:23.120]   So fine, you're different.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.840]   You're not the person we're going to think of when we have these small, little, stupid
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:28.360]   crises, and we're not going to invite you to every meeting.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.560]   So those are your two options.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:35.960]   Go smaller, or put the chips down and say, "Hold me accountable," and then actually deliver.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:41.120]   All right, do we have a call this week?
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.120]   We do have a call.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.120]   Oh, excellent.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.120]   All right, let's hear it.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.120]   Okay.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.120]   Hi, Cal.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.720]   My name is Kevin, and I'm an attorney, and I had a question about two of the ideas you
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.720]   propose in slow productivity.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.560]   First, you advocate for pre-scheduling time to complete your projects when something new
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.560]   is assigned to you.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:02.000]   I love this idea, and I found it to be very helpful in managing my workload, giving me
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.160]   the ability to give an informed answer when someone actually asks me if I can take on
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.480]   something new, rather than just guessing.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:12.360]   However, I'm having some trouble using pre-scheduling with another technique from the book, the
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.360]   poll system.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:18.600]   I like the idea of a poll system and only working on one thing at a time, but my pre-scheduled
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.520]   calendar is now effectively pushing projects forward before I'm ready to work on them.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:26.560]   Like, I'll be working on project A, but then my calendar tells me it's time to work on
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:31.280]   project B, so either I have to stop project A to shift my focus or rework my entire pre-scheduled
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.280]   calendar to accommodate.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.680]   Now, there is an element of poor planning here.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.920]   I'm not good at estimating the time it will take me to finish things, but it's also because
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.600]   I'm juggling important projects that don't have a deadline with urgent deadline-driven
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.600]   projects.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:46.800]   Do you have any tips for managing the two systems, or more broadly, can a poll system
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.800]   survive in a deadline-driven work environment?
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:53.240]   Thanks so much for your time and your excellent work.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.240]   This is a great question.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:02.600]   This is a great question, because these are two different suggestions that I give in the
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:07.760]   Slow Productivity, in my book, Slow Productivity, during the chapter on doing fewer things.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:11.040]   I'm giving very practical advice about how to actually get away from this, and there
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:15.880]   is a tension between these two pieces of advice that's partially fundamental, but there is
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.840]   a way for them to work together.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:21.840]   So let's get into, let me highlight this tension a little better for the audience, right?
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.420]   So the pre-scheduling method says, okay, if someone asks you to do some work, go find
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:30.600]   the time for it ahead of time, put that on your calendar.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:37.840]   So you have to deal with, realistically, how much time you actually have available, right?
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.000]   So what happens when you have to schedule your time on the calendar?
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.800]   A, you might not be able to find it, at least in a reasonable window around the current
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:50.040]   moment, in which case, you have just gotten clear feedback, I'm too busy to do this.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.840]   And it's not arbitrary, I just feel busy, which people don't react well to.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.160]   It's concrete and evidence-based.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.360]   I went to schedule the time to do this, I pre-scheduled time for all my projects, I
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.420]   couldn't find it in the next six weeks, so I must be too busy to do this.
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:06.640]   It's hard for people to push back on that, because they either have to claim you're lying,
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.240]   or they have to insist that, like, I guess you work outside of work hours, right?
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.500]   They can't just let that implicitly happen, they have to insist on it, and they don't
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.500]   want to, all right?
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:18.480]   Another thing that might happen is you find the time for it, but it's, you know, three
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.720]   weeks from now.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:23.440]   Now you can be super clear, this is when I'm going to get to this.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.620]   And then as long as you deliver, that's probably okay, right?
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:29.000]   But it gets you out of the situation where you just agree to things, and then people
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.880]   are just constantly bothering you, when am I going to get this, and you don't actually
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.880]   have time to get it done.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.320]   So pre-scheduling can be very powerful.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.320]   The pull system is different.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:41.760]   The pull system, the goal of the pull system is to make sure you don't work on too many
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.200]   things at the same time, all right?
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.880]   And the way it solves that problem, instead of having you just schedule your calendar,
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.800]   so like you're not putting too many things into the same amount of time, the pull system
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:56.240]   says I only have two or three active projects at a time, when I finish an active project,
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.640]   then I pull something new from the list of things I'm working on.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.960]   So it's impossible for me to be working on too many things, because I have a, what in
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:07.260]   Kanban they call a WIP, or works in progress limit, I have a limit on how many things I
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.400]   work on at the same time, here they are.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.200]   If it's three, I'm never working on more than three things.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:15.800]   And if someone gives me something to do, I can say yes, I will do it, and here's its
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.120]   status.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:20.120]   It's on the waiting list, it's in position three, and I'll let you know when I pull it
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.120]   in.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.000]   All right?
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.600]   So two different strategies to get you to the same place, which is not working on too
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.080]   many things at the same time.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:35.960]   They do, they are intention for exactly the reason the caller talks about, if you try
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:43.640]   to do two at the same time, your pulled projects are stepping on the same time that you have
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.640]   pre-scheduled, right?
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.560]   So how can these two things work together?
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:54.200]   They can only work together if you are sort of dividing your work between these two systems
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.720]   in a very intentional way.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:02.080]   So maybe you have a certain type of work that's very deadline-driven and needs specific times
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.220]   and other types of work that's more on you to figure out when it gets done, right?
[00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:11.720]   And so what you could do, for example, is schedule, pre-schedule regular time on your
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:16.720]   calendar for the non-deadline-driven work coming out of your pull system, and with the
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:21.600]   remaining time on your calendar, it's when you pre-schedule the deadline-driven stuff.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:26.400]   So now when I have a new deadline-driven thing that I'm pre-scheduling, part of the time
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:30.920]   that's off the table here is the time on my calendar I've already put aside for my pull
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:31.920]   system work.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:35.240]   So I have to work with whatever time remains.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.320]   Then when I get to the time on my calendar that's for the pull system stuff, I work on
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.080]   whatever is active, and when I finish something, I pull something new in.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:45.880]   So you could have these two things work together, but you have to schedule time for the pull
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.880]   system work in general.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:51.640]   Typically I would say what the people I know who actually use these systems, they tend
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.420]   to do one or the other.
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:57.940]   So the pre-scheduling, for example, and I talk about it this way in the book, it's not
[00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:02.020]   something that people tend to use for a long time.
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:07.180]   It's often something that people will use for like six months, and what they learn when
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:13.340]   they do this is they get a much more realistic understanding of how long things take, what
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:19.500]   busy really means, like what workload actually is unsustainably busy, and it structures their
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:20.500]   time more.
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:24.500]   So it's a learning tool, and they come out of their pre-scheduling experience having
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.160]   recalibrated for their new job.
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:31.000]   And now they don't need to do this so much, it's because they just have this intuition
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.560]   now that's born through evidence-based experience of like, "No, no, no, I'm too busy right now,"
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:40.000]   because you've had to grapple with this time and know how long things take.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.220]   So often, that's what I see with pre-scheduling.
[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:47.560]   People do it for a while, get better at understanding their workloads, and then stop using it.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.480]   The pull-based system, by contrast, is meant to be sustainable.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.640]   It's just like, "This is how I organize my work.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.640]   Here's my waiting list.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:54.640]   Here's my active list.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.800]   You can look on the waiting list to see exactly where your work is.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.480]   You can watch it mark forward.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.280]   If you want me to reprioritize it, you tell me what you want to swap for.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.000]   You can help me make priority decisions."
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.860]   That's meant to be a long-term sustainable system.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:10.320]   I love the pull system because it prevents overload.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:15.360]   I love the pre-scheduling exercise because it forces you to learn how long things really
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.040]   take.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:20.600]   You can put them together in the way I suggested if your job requires that.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.600]   It's a little bit more complicated.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:24.740]   You're starting to get a little fiddly here, but it is possible, but that's going to take
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:25.740]   some more care.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.560]   That's a good call.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:30.920]   I think we have a case study here.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:34.660]   Case studies, if you're new, this is where people write in to talk about putting the
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:39.600]   type of advice we talk about this show into action in their own lives.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.080]   So today's case study is a short one.
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.600]   It comes from Beth.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:48.880]   Beth says, "I'm a tenured professor whose main job is doing research.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:53.360]   I do a lot of collaboration with co-authors and recently stumbled upon something that
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:58.880]   works great for focused work and minimizing administrative overhead.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:02.880]   In the past, my co-authors and I would work independently for a week or two, then have
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:06.200]   an hour-long meeting to discuss and repeat and repeat.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:12.040]   I recently tried to have day-long sessions devoted exclusively to a single academic project
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.660]   with a co-author or team of co-authors.
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:21.000]   We get so much more done when we work together for a half day or whole day than if we string
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.640]   things out over many, many weeks.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.360]   I'm sure this builds on many of Cal's concepts, but I'll leave it to him to say which ones
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.360]   exactly."
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:35.840]   Well, Beth, I've had the same experience in my own career as a professor, research-oriented
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:42.080]   professor, especially early in a project when you're trying to make progress.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:47.640]   If you're just doing this with, "Let's check in once a week," what do people do?
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:51.560]   They do either nothing or the bare minimum to have something to talk about at the next
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:52.560]   meeting, right?
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:56.920]   It's just not urgent to them, like, "Oh, we have a standing meeting to talk about this
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:00.960]   research paper," and you spend a half hour kind of reminding everyone where you are and
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.540]   maybe someone thought a little bit about something, and you're right, months can go by and not
[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:06.160]   much gets done.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:11.240]   On the other hand, if you all get together for a day and you load up this problem collectively
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:15.520]   in your heads and you put all of your attention on it, leveraging what I call the whiteboard
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:18.840]   effect where everyone's working on the same deep project at the same time, so it eggs
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:23.880]   each other on to be even more focused, you can crack problems.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.760]   You can figure out the major results.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:28.820]   You can make a ton of progress.
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:32.600]   This was at the core when I was at the height of my CS paper production.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.840]   These long annual in-person sessions, this is where a lot of the work got done.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.880]   We had certain times of the year where we'd get together and we'd call it "cracking problems."
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:44.720]   I would travel all the time, go to Europe, I'd go to Iceland.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:48.920]   You'd go wherever you needed to sit down with professors you worked with, spend three days.
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.740]   That's when papers got cracked.
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:53.520]   Now once they're cracked, you have the main results.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:57.720]   Now you can be distributed, but now when you're being distributed, it's not just, "Think about
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.520]   this paper and make progress," you're assigning tasks.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.280]   You write a draft of this intro, we'll check back.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:06.360]   You'll write up this proof, I'll write up this proof, and then we'll check them.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:11.240]   Once you have specific work to do, then it's fine to be virtual.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:15.040]   I think this rhythm of, "Get together until you crack the heart of what you're working
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:20.160]   on," and now just the workman-like effort of putting together the paper, now we don't
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.160]   have to do this together.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.160]   We can spread this out.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.800]   I think that's a really good way to do this.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:29.360]   The more general lesson here, I think, in general for knowledge work, is that spending
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:34.920]   a significant amount of time on a problem with other people is like a super brain tackling
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:35.920]   the problem.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.440]   It really is effective.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:44.160]   The trap here that, in general, knowledge workers should be careful to avoid is the
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.600]   weekly meeting trap.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:50.600]   When you have a hard thing you're trying to solve, a new business strategy, a new program,
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:56.500]   a new business, a result you're trying to crack mathematically, or a new idea to publish
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:58:01.960]   in a paper, this illusion of, "If we just put a standing meeting on our calendar for
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:06.480]   us to talk about this every week, we'll make progress," is just that.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.080]   It's an illusion.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:12.420]   Like Beth experienced or I experienced, this will just seem like an obligation on people's
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:17.040]   calendars where they'll either do nothing, so you just spin your wheels each week, or
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:21.840]   they do the bare minimum, so it's not socially embarrassing when they show up on the call.
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:25.880]   But the total amount of work that each person is doing when you just have a weekly meeting,
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:28.520]   it's like 10 minutes of productive thought.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:31.360]   The other hand, if we're like, "We're here for five hours.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:34.440]   Here's our whiteboard.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:38.340]   Let's make progress," now you actually have a chance of getting the smartest possible
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:40.600]   thinking out of their brains.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:44.280]   I've talked about this before on the show, but I experienced this during the first year
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.280]   of the pandemic.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:51.200]   I was like, "Why are my CS papers not coming together the way they normally do?"
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:55.320]   I realized it was like, "Oh, because we're not getting together to do these full day
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.320]   sessions."
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.640]   We had standing meetings all throughout the early pandemic.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.280]   Get on Zoom every week.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.440]   Things weren't being cracked.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.320]   There's one paper in particular we're working on all throughout the pandemic, and it was
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.440]   these standing meetings and nothing was happening.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:13.400]   As soon as I could get away with it, I brought my two local collaborators, one from Georgetown,
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:18.640]   one from Hopkins, to the Deep Work HQ, have a whiteboard in there.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:22.080]   Don't tell the COVID police, but let's come here, let's look at the whiteboard, let's
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:27.120]   spend the day, and we cracked a problem, and we published that paper, and it won the best
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:28.280]   paper award at our conference.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.800]   It's like, "Oh, that's what we were missing."
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:34.680]   Until we sit together, there's no real mind work actually happening.
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:38.640]   I love this idea, groups of minds working together on the same problem for an extended
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:43.140]   period of time is very, very effective for making progress on something.
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:47.680]   Weekly meetings to check in on a project is often incredibly ineffective, unless, again,
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:51.080]   you have incredibly specific things people are working on with clear criteria of it being
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:52.080]   done.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:56.160]   So, Beth, I appreciate the question.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:59.680]   All right, we have a cool final segment coming up.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:04.680]   It's the first podcast of July, so it's when I'm going to talk about the books I read in
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.460]   June.
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:10.480]   But first, let's talk about some of the sponsors that make this show possible.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:19.120]   In particular, I want to talk about our friends at Shopify, selling a little or a lot, Shopify
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.480]   helps you do your thing, however you cha-ching.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:27.000]   I'm sure you've heard about Shopify, it's the global commerce platform that helps you
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.840]   sell at every stage of your business.
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:34.880]   We're talking from the launcher online shop stage to the first real life store stage,
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.320]   all the way to the, "Did we just hit a million order stage?"
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:42.920]   Shopify is here to help you grow, whether you're selling things online or need a point
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.080]   of sale solution for your physical store.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:52.300]   They really are the industry leader on the sales experience.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:58.480]   When we start our long awaited deep question store, it is 100% Shopify that we will use
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.800]   to take care of the e-commerce.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.200]   It's going to make it so easy.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.640]   Jesse, I had another store idea, by the way.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.640]   What do we got?
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.640]   Coming up here.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.880]   Well, I needed a hat, right?
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.660]   Because I have my Nationals hat, but it's starting to fall apart and it's kind of hot.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:16.120]   And so I had to search around and we looked at a bunch of stores just to buy a new hat.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.600]   I remember thinking, "Man, I wish we had our own hat because I could just be wearing my
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.600]   own hat.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.160]   I don't have to wear some, I have a Patagonia hat I bought.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.800]   I want to wear my own hat."
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.720]   That made me think, "I wish we had our deep questions store."
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:36.520]   I'm thinking black and gray mesh, maybe trucker type hat, and I don't know, I want really
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:44.280]   small just the initials for values-based lifestyle-centric career planning, like just VBLCPP, just small
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.420]   letters right down here.
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:47.920]   If you know what it is, you know what it is.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.040]   If you don't, you're like, "I know this is really specific and probably really cool."
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:56.200]   Anyways, when we get that hat shop together, Shopify, right?
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.620]   They already power 10% of all e-commerce in the US.
[01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.620]   They know what they're doing.
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:07.740]   That's going to make our tasteful and provocative VBLCPP hats really fly off that digital shelf.
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:12.560]   Sign up for a $1 per month trial period at shopify.com/deep.

[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.880]   you're in, shopify.com/deep.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:29.120]   I also want to talk about our long-time friends at ExpressVPN.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.840]   I really think about this more when I'm traveling, but going online without ExpressVPN is like
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:40.760]   not closing the door when you use the bathroom, right?
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.600]   Why give random creeps a chance to invade your privacy?
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.960]   Well, that's essentially what you're doing when you use the internet without a VPN.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:48.960]   Why is this?
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:55.680]   Well, when you use the internet, your address and the destination of the sites or services
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:59.600]   you're accessing are out there in the open.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.680]   It's called a packet header, right?
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.880]   So if you're on a wireless internet connection, anyone nearby can see what sites and services
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:05.880]   you're using.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:10.040]   If you're using a private internet service provider at home, they see what sites and
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.560]   services you're using.
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.520]   A VPN hides all that.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:20.000]   When you use a VPN, you instead encrypt an unbreakable code, here's the site and service
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.300]   I want to talk to.
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:26.500]   You then send this to a VPN server that then decrypts that code and talks to the site and
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:30.620]   service on your behalf, encrypts their answer and sends it back to you.
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:34.380]   So the person listening into your wireless connection, your internet service provider
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:38.900]   that you're directly connected to, all they learn about what you're doing is that you're
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:41.320]   accessing a VPN server, right?
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.300]   So it gives you actual privacy.
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:47.920]   It's the digital equivalent of closing that door when you go to the bathroom.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.020]   Your IP address is hidden.
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:51.460]   It's easy to use.
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:55.900]   You just fire up the ExpressVPN app and use your apps and services like normal, it just
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.020]   happens automatically in the background.
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:01.980]   You can use ExpressVPN on all your devices, your phones, your laptops, your tablets, and
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:02.980]   more.
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:06.780]   It's rated number one by top reviewers like CNET and The Verge.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:11.060]   I like it because of its ease of use and its speed.
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:12.060]   It's got servers everywhere.
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.060]   It's got high bandwidth.
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:14.060]   It just works well.
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.740]   You click a button, and you're protected.
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:21.700]   So protect your online privacy today by visiting expressvpn.com/deep.

[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:32.060]   You will get an extra three months free when you go to expressvpn.com/deep.
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:37.980]   All right, Jesse, time for our final segment.
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:44.500]   All right, as longtime listeners know, my target is to read five books per month.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.700]   I'll tell you what, Jesse, the July list is going to be a little longer than that, because
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:48.700]   I'm on vacation.
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.060]   So it's going to rock and roll.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:55.660]   We'll have a little longer segment when we get to the next one.
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:57.780]   But I want to report now on what I read last month.
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:58.980]   So this is early July.
[01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:03.780]   So I will report on what I read in June 2024.
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.300]   All right.
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:10.060]   I'll start with, I'm going to reorder, let me reorder these a little bit.
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:13.300]   I'll start with, I wrote two movie related books.
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:21.020]   The first was called Hit, Flops, and Other Illusions by Ed Zwick.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:26.700]   So Ed Zwick is sort of a well-known director in Hollywood, directed a lot of well-known
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:27.700]   movies.
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:30.740]   Maybe he's best known for Glory.
[01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:36.040]   Denzel Washington won his first Oscar for that movie, and a lot of other movies as well.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.700]   This is just a Hollywood memoir.
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.700]   And I, you know, I'm a sucker for these, Jesse, as I've said this before.
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:43.660]   I just think it's a cool, interesting industry.
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:47.140]   And I like hearing about how people break in and get started and then like what it's
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:49.580]   actually like working in the industry.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:52.980]   Ed has an interesting story about breaking in.
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:06:00.140]   He kind of like stumbled into being a head writer on a TV show.
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:01.140]   They liked the script.
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.140]   They hired him.
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:03.140]   The head writer got fired.
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:04.140]   He got put into this position.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:08.020]   So he was sort of in the industry, but he was in the television side of it.
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:14.140]   And the way that they made the move, Ed made the move from this sort of lucky position
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:20.980]   in TV to movies is that he pitched a TV movie, which now I want to track down and find.
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.060]   This is like a pretty innovative thing.
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:24.460]   I believe this was in the 1980s.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:30.580]   He pitched a TV movie where the premise was there was some sort of disaster.
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:33.660]   I think it was nuclear war, but it might've been something else.
[01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:35.780]   I think it was like a nuclear attack.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:42.340]   And the made for TV movie, they played it like a, they played it, I don't know the right
[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:43.340]   word for this.
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:44.340]   It was like, it was really happening.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.180]   It was like a war of the worlds type thing.
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:50.340]   So it was, you know, newscasters, it was like newscasters and news footage.
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:57.020]   So it's like you were watching a, a news program and getting like, okay, now we're on scene
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:00.900]   and the stuff is happening and, and they, they had real newscasters behind desks.
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:04.260]   So it was just sort of like really interesting war of the worlds type update, really kind
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:05.740]   of innovative and it won some Emmys.
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:09.180]   And that's like what let him then jump over to movies.
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.900]   It also makes it clear that the movies are a stressful business.
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.060]   So let's just make that clear.
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:19.540]   The other movie related book, I actually listened to this once that I read it was surely you
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:20.780]   can't be serious.
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:24.780]   It was written by the Zucker brothers and Jim, Jim Abrahams.
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:29.800]   This is a, an oral history essentially of the making of the greatest comedy movie of
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.740]   all time airplane.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:33.740]   So surely you can't be serious.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:37.740]   If you haven't seen the movie, I mean, come on, you should know this reference.
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:44.420]   This is one of the famous lines in the movie where Leslie Nielsen, who's playing the doctor
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:45.420]   on the plane.
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.060]   Someone says to him, surely you can't be serious.
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:52.260]   And he says, I am, and don't call me surely it's like a classic airplane, classic airplane
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:53.260]   line.
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:54.260]   Interesting book.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:08:01.220]   I listened to it and like I said, just listen to it because it's, it's a oral history style.
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:07.420]   Like if you've read like a ringer oral history, it's various people talking about things,
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:13.380]   these different moments in the buildup and making of this film, the Zuckers and Jim,
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:17.860]   but then also like interludes from famous comedy personalities from today.
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:23.100]   It's like, it'll be like Bill Hader, Judd Apatow, right.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.700]   We'll have comments on it and the influence of this movie.
[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:27.220]   And so it goes back and forth.
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:29.380]   If you listen to it, it's the real people talking.
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:31.100]   So it's like different voices.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.660]   So it's like, almost like a conversation.
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:34.700]   It's a little bit weird.
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.420]   Here's a couple of things that's weird about it.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:42.980]   One, the, the conversation is clearly like a transcript.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:46.940]   It reads a little weird in the audio book because it's not the original conversation.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:50.660]   It's clearly them rereading the edited transcript for the audio book.
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:55.060]   So there's like a, sometimes there's a bit of a, it's false, not false, but like, this
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:58.100]   is someone reading something they said earlier, but without the same inflection.
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:02.500]   One of the Zucker brothers is older now too, and his voice is not very strong.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:05.900]   So like, it's, it's a little bit weird.
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:10.740]   And the, the structuring is a little weird on this book too, because it's not, it's not
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:16.300]   just a straight chronological, like, let's just move forward starting from like how the
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.780]   Kentucky Fried Theater, the Zucker brothers theater got started in their first movie and
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:21.860]   how they got the airplane and the steps of airplane.
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:26.460]   It's almost that, except for early on, they pull some stuff from later on and move it
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:27.460]   earlier.
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:28.460]   So you kind of give up on that.
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:32.900]   Like, so early on, you're starting to get the stories of like how the comedy troupe
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:37.980]   came together, but then you'll also get stories about casting airplane and then it'll be back
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:40.380]   to like, okay, here's the first thing they did in LA.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:43.220]   And then as you get later in the book, it's, it's strictly chronological again.
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.380]   So it was a little bit confusing.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:51.420]   So maybe it'd be quicker to read and make more sense reading, but you got fantastic information
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:56.500]   there about like how these brothers got together, how they made this movie, why it worked.
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:00.660]   So I enjoyed it, especially if you are an airplane fan, right?
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:05.700]   Then I read, this is a random, uh, two ocean themed books.
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:08.540]   The first was, and you can tell by the way, just, this is a weird reading list.
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.540]   You know why?
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:12.140]   Because, uh, I was exhausted from my book tour.
[01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:16.980]   It's just, you'll see, you'll see in my next reading list, uh, cause I'm already well into
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:17.980]   it.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:21.940]   The books are way more like interesting and complicated, but I was exhausted and you get
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:23.180]   this in this, this reading list.
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.180]   All right.
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:29.140]   The next book I read was in oceans deep by bill Strever, which I actually had in my library
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:30.180]   from a while ago.
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:31.460]   I'd bought it, but not read it.
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:32.620]   And I got around to reading it.
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:41.380]   It's like a history of underwater exploration and diving, you know, like early diving suits,
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:45.180]   submarines, submersibles, scuba, just like a history.
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:47.380]   Bill Strever is a former diver.
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:52.700]   So it was just like a straight history, uh, perfectly competently written about like the
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.660]   history of underwater exploration.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:11:01.820]   Then I read, I had never read this before, jaws by Peter Benchley, like the original
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:04.660]   novel jaws that was made into the movie.
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:11.140]   Uh, as people who read slow productivity know, Peter Benchley wrote jaws essentially across
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:13.620]   the street from the house where I grew up.
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:19.700]   So in Pennington, New Jersey, uh, it's like two, two, uh, houses down was the house that
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:22.580]   he was renting in the seventies when he wrote jaws.
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:25.220]   So I always felt like a connection to that.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.420]   Uh, jaws was great.
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:27.940]   I see why this book did well.
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:31.380]   I mean, it's, it's a cool, it's, it's a tight book.
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:32.740]   Uh, it's great.
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:33.740]   It's entertaining.
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:37.460]   It, it has an another storyline layer too.
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.460]   That's not in the movie.
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:46.300]   So Spielberg really rightly so simplified this thing down man versus beast, like this
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:51.540]   unlikely trio of guys are going after the shark, either the shark will win or they will
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.540]   win.
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:55.660]   And that was the right thing to do for the movie, for a book that might not be enough.
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:58.580]   So there's a, there's two other plot lines.
[01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:03.300]   There's like a mob plot line in this where like the reason the mayor is trying to keep
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:07.260]   the town open is because he's in hock to all these mobsters and they're sort of like threatening
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:08.900]   him and forcing him to do this.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:16.180]   Um, and there's like a plot line where the wife of the police chief is like unhappy and
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:18.220]   has an affair with the Richard Dreyfuss character.
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:22.780]   And there's a whole like psychological backstory there where she used to be one of the rich
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:26.460]   people who would summer in this town.
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:31.060]   And then she married a local and now she's like a local, but the rich people still come
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:32.060]   there.
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:36.420]   So like in a good novel, uh, sort of a pre Crichton era novels, you have, you have to
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.140]   have the sort of psychological realism.
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:41.020]   So it has these other things going on that fill it in.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:43.020]   Um, but the shark stuff is cool.
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:47.140]   Uh, clearly they don't know what they didn't know a ton about sharks back then.
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:50.100]   It's kind of funny the way Peter talks about jaws.
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:55.860]   It's like this mindless killing machine, um, that is just going to like eat you from the
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:57.300]   bottom up, bite after bite.
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:00.380]   Like, you know, they didn't know much about great white sharks.
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:05.100]   It's just like these things will, and they're like, they would just eat to figure out what
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:07.660]   things are and like complete like automatons.
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:08.660]   And it's, it's interesting.
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:12.860]   It's like they, they clearly, uh, we're trying to figure out what this thing is, but it was
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:13.860]   jaws was great.
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:14.860]   Uh, I enjoyed it.
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:15.860]   Great, great summer book.
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:20.340]   And then I finally got around, this is a book in sort of my orbit more.
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:25.340]   I finally got around to reading Michael Easter's book, the comfort crisis.
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:29.300]   So this is an idea book, Michael Easter.
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:36.260]   He runs the online community 2% and was a lecturer, I think at, uh, university of Nevada,
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:39.740]   Las Vegas, but recently left that to do writing full time.
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:42.780]   But he writes a lot about like fitness and health.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.300]   Um, he's really good.
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:47.580]   I think getting into like the studies and what's going on to comfort crisis.
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:53.340]   This book was from, oh, 2019, maybe, you know, a little while ago, uh, and it was really
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:54.340]   good actually.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:55.340]   It's very impressive.
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:57.140]   I think this book is doing well.
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:00.900]   It has legs that came out a while ago, but it's still selling really well.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:06.140]   His basic idea is we are uncomfortable with being uncomfortable and that this is a problem
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:09.900]   and that we need to become more comfortable with discomfort.
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:14.140]   And it opens up also, not only is it more aligned with our sort of natural wiring, but
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:17.780]   it opens up all of this, like possibilities for like growth in your life.
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:23.980]   Uh, there's a cool set piece story in Easter's book that goes throughout the whole thing.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:30.900]   So he keeps returning to this story of this sort of epic month long elk hunting, like
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:37.540]   really trying elk hunting trip in the Arctic and with as plenty of discomfort, like they're
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:41.780]   not starving, but they're hungry all the time and it's cold and it's hard.
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:43.980]   And so that's like a really great spine for the book.
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:49.060]   And um, you know, what makes these ideas books good is where there's a, like an overall idea.
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.060]   You're like, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:51.680]   Like I should have more discomfort in my life.
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:56.580]   But then what really makes these things work is when there's like interesting ideas or
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:15:01.500]   people to meet who are putting that into action and you're like, Oh yeah, that, that I should
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.500]   do that.
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.780]   Or maybe that changes the way I think about things.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:08.360]   So like in this book, he gets really in the rucking, which is like a big thing right now,
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:12.020]   but like in a very compelling way, like with the guy who started go rock.
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:18.500]   Um, and there's this other fitness nutritionist he talks to where he like really gets that
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:23.980]   being comfortable with the discomfort of feeling hungry is like a big part of like what's really
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:27.380]   involved in losing weight and like, that was a kind of a compelling story.
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:29.780]   And then Michael's own story is compelling.
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:35.920]   Him being in Alaska is compelling, uh, him kicking, go going sober is like another part
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.920]   of it.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920]   So all the pieces came together.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.920]   Anyways.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.920]   I really liked it.
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:43.020]   I thought as these sort of make your life better idea books go, and I'm reading more
[01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:46.180]   of these now because I'm thinking about the deep life, it's a good one.
[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:48.660]   So I, so I enjoyed reading that and I, I should probably reach out to Michael.
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:50.780]   I think he'd be a cool guy to know.
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:52.740]   Um, you might like that one, Jesse.
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:53.740]   Yeah.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:54.740]   Yeah.
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:59.620]   They talk about that in sports a lot, like coaching and stuff, like being uncomfortable
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.900]   and yeah, like athletes are used to it.
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:02.900]   Yeah.
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:03.900]   Yeah.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:04.900]   All right.
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.500]   So anyways, those are the books I read in June.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.500]   All right, Jesse.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:12.980]   So I think that's all the time we have for today's episode, but we will be back next
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:17.260]   week with another episode again, probably recorded from my undisclosed location.
[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:20.940]   Maybe we'll talk more next week about the writing shed on this property.
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:22.140]   That's something I could talk about for a while.
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:26.300]   There is an excellent writing shed on this property and I have some ideas about that
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:27.300]   to share.
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:32.340]   So remind me, Jesse, we'll talk about that next time, but until then, as always stay
[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:33.340]   deep.
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:38.580]   Hey, so if you like today's discussion about getting away from technology to embrace the
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:44.700]   quiet brain, I think you'll also like episode 300 in which I talked about hidden technology
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.060]   traps.
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.180]   Check it out.
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:51.820]   How the U S is destroying young people's future.
