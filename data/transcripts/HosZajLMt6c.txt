[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   Hello, this is Gary Kim at ShepCon. I'm here with Richard. Richard, can you introduce yourself?
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.480]   Yeah, my name is Richard Vargas. I'm the Executive Director of IFCA International.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.040]   Okay, and Richard, you've been reading the LSB for a little bit. What do you think?
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.280]   I think it's a great Bible. I grew up with the New American Standard, and so I love that.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.480]   And of course I was a graduate here from TMS and a professor for a little while, so I just
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.560]   love the clarity of it. I love the translation. It's pretty smooth. It's great for teaching.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.680]   And I do a lot of teaching. I travel a lot. And even internationally when I'm teaching,
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.480]   it makes it really simple for people, even of different cultures, to understand what
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.320]   the text says.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.040]   Thanks Richard for stopping by. I appreciate it.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.320]   Yeah, thank you.
