[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance. The show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:57.800]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.000]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua, and I am
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   your host, your guide, and your fellow traveler on this journey towards financial independence.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.500]   Today we do live Q&A. I've got a conference line opened up, a couple of callers sitting
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.500]   on the line. We'll go and have some questions and have some chats about financial independence.
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.080]   I enjoy doing these shows because it gives me a chance to talk to you and allows it to
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.020]   be very practical. One of the challenges of being a podcast host is it's easy for me to
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.080]   sit in my office and come up with things that seem relevant to me. But sometimes without
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.680]   that live interaction with you, it's often hard for me to be sure that the comments are
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.400]   very – that what I have to share with you is going to be really, really relevant.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.600]   So we've got a few callers on the line, and we'll have to deal with some real-life
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.680]   situations. So let's start with Matt in Tampa. Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.200]   How can I serve you today, please?
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   All right. Thanks, Joshua. Thanks for taking my call. So my wife and I, in about two years,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.780]   plan on me going to seminary and we'll be moving. And my hope is that I've accumulated
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.140]   enough cash as well as some assets and different retirement accounts that when I'm at seminary,
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.140]   I'll be able to primarily focus on my studies and my family and perhaps only work part-time
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.360]   if necessary. So I guess my main question was to get some of your thoughts about how
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.360]   I can hack efficiently, get distributions out of these retirement accounts, and specifically
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:42.320]   how to utilize a backdoor Roth/Roth conversion. And also to talk about, I guess, the five-year
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.600]   rule as it pertains to taking out qualified distributions, if I understand it right. But
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.680]   that's pretty much the main two questions.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.560]   Okay. Well, let's start with – I want to make sure we do a good job. So let's start
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.720]   not with jumping right into that, but give me just a quick overview of your financial
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.720]   situation. How much money do you have in IRA or 401(k) accounts presently?
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.880]   Presently in my IRA and Roth IRA –
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.880]   Separate the Roth – hold on. Just the IRA or traditional 401(k)?
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.880]   Okay. In the traditional 401(k), my wife and I have a combination of about 7,000 as of
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:32.880]   today, and the traditional IRA is about 4,000. So about a total of 12-ish.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.800]   And now how much in Roth IRAs between the two of you?
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   About 4,500.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   4,500. And of that 4,500, do you have any guesses on how much of that is your contribution
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.280]   to the account?
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.080]   I haven't looked for a while, but I would say about probably 3,500 or so.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.640]   Okay. And do you have other money outside of retirement accounts, other savings or investments
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.680]   that aren't in these 401(k) accounts?
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.680]   Sure. As of today, we should have somewhere around $25,000 in cash, just in bank and physical
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.320]   cash.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.640]   Okay. Great. And do you have any debt?
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.280]   No. No debt.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.920]   Okay. So basically the question is you've got $25,000 in cash, you've got $4,500 in
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.680]   the Roth IRA, and then in traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, you have about $11,000. And your
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.120]   goal is to go to seminary and graduate with no debt or as little debt as possible and
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.280]   to do this in the most efficient way. Is that accurate?
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.280]   Yes, that's accurate. I also, I should have said this, I do have about $2,300 in a 457B
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:56.840]   deferred compensation, and I also have about 5,000 in a health savings account, which I
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.960]   try to forget about and just keep it for health emergencies.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.280]   Okay. When do you plan to start seminary? How many years from now?
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   Approximately two years, fall of 2019.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.320]   And have you already chosen where you'd like to go to seminary?
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.080]   Yes, I believe so. It hasn't been finalized, but I think we've narrowed it down.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.520]   How much is it going to cost you per year?
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.160]   Per year, the tuition is about $6,000.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.920]   Okay. And how many years will you be going?
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.760]   It should be a four-year program.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.760]   Okay. So your total cost here for your program is $24,000. Do you have any idea about financial
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:43.600]   aid, scholarships, other grants and things like that at this point in time?
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.480]   No, not really.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.760]   Okay. And what's your plan as far as living expenses? How much do you think you're going
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.760]   to need for living expenses during that $4,000 time, sorry, during that four-year time?
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.760]   As of right now, it looks like somewhere around $2,200 a month, although the rental situation
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:11.640]   is a little iffy. And then of course with healthcare, that's kind of been a difficult
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.520]   one for me to assess just with some of the political changes or potential changes or
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.560]   lack thereof.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.520]   What's your current plan for household income?
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.240]   Household income at that time in seminary?
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.640]   Yes. How are you going to earn your money? Is your wife going to bring income to the
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.320]   family? What's your plan?
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.880]   Predominantly it should only be me. My wife and I hope that she can be a homemaker, although
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:46.160]   she is a registered nurse, so she might be able to do a little bit here and there. Predominantly
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.680]   it would be me bringing in somewhere between maybe $5,000 to $10,000, either working at
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:59.320]   the seminary or potentially I should have my MBA by then, so I might be able to work
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.880]   something in accounting or business or taxes.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.360]   And is your question on the backdoor Roth, the five-year plan and all of that, is your
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:15.360]   question basically around the idea of converting the traditional IRA and traditional 401(k)
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.360]   to a Roth with the goal of minimizing your 10% penalty tax? Is that what you're hoping
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.560]   for?
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.960]   Yes. Yeah, my hope was that I could begin those conversions in those years that I'm
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:34.520]   not really earning any or very much earned income and then pay the "tax" at that
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:42.240]   time at a zero rate or close to that and then take the qualified distributions for higher
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:48.560]   education expense from the Roth. I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.560]   Interesting.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:55.880]   Okay, yeah, and the question I had about the distribution is from what I had read from
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:04.920]   the IRS and other articles, I wasn't sure if I needed one particular Roth IRA to have
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.900]   existed for up to five years and then the monies I convert into that could be taken
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:16.400]   out as qualified distributions or if each instance of monies being converted to that
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.760]   Roth had to have a five-year waiting period in order to avoid that 10% penalty. That's
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.760]   where I'm a little lost.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.000]   It's a good question. I don't know the answer for certain off the top of my head.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.720]   My guess would be, based upon the intent, kind of the spirit of the intent of the rules,
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.800]   my guess would be that the focus that they want is they want to have the money itself
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:46.960]   seasoned for five years. So not just that an account has existed. Otherwise, I think
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.840]   that would be an abusive situation. Let's say that I had – I'm 40 years old. I've
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.760]   had a Roth account since I was 20 years old. But then I'd want to do a conversion into
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:01.320]   the Roth account this year and because of the fact that the Roth has existed for 20
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:08.320]   years, then I can just take it out right away. I don't think that is – although I can't
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.960]   cite it for sure and say, "Hey, here's the code or the tax court ruling," or anything
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.640]   like that that would say that. That doesn't match the spirit of the law as I understand
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   it to be.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:23.320]   In general, with tax planning, you're pretty safe to go with the spirit of the law. There
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.240]   are a few exceptions but in general, if you're looking at it, just think, "OK, how would
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.580]   a thoughtful, rational person apply this?" The five-year rule is – for distributions
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.940]   from a Roth IRA, the five-year rule is intended to mean that the money needs to actually be
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:43.080]   there for five years. So I think it would actually be the actual dollars that have been
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.560]   converted that need to sit there for five years.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:55.640]   But I don't think that – I mean in general in your situation, I don't think this is
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:01.240]   going to be a big thing either way. You have a lot of money outside of the cash. We're
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.160]   only – in terms of your asset structure, you're really – these 401(k)s and IRAs
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.320]   are a very small component of your overall plan.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.440]   So yes, if your income drops during the time that you're in school, then look carefully
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:22.760]   and see, "Can I go ahead and make a conversion to this?" But if your income drops substantially,
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.720]   then that is the time to go ahead and make any conversions that you can. Do you think
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.920]   you'll be able to save more money in the next couple of years?
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:40.040]   Yes. By the time I go to seminary, my expectation is we should have about $85,000 or so in the
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:46.160]   different assets. And I think the overall cost should be $120,000 to $140,000. So there's
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.480]   still a gap, but I think most of that could be filled with part-time work or maybe some
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.080]   other advantageous situations.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.080]   And do you and your wife presently have children?
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.760]   I'm sorry, can you say that again?
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.880]   Do you guys presently have children?
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.400]   No, but we are expecting this coming year.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.840]   Awesome. Congratulations. Well, I guess my thoughts for you, just to kind of wrap up,
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:14.520]   hopefully I've answered the question sufficiently. My thought for you would be do everything
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:21.160]   you can to earn now. And then probably the biggest cost is not necessarily the cost of
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:27.880]   seminary but the cost of housing and living expenses. And I think that while you're in
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:37.120]   seminary it's an appropriate time for you to look for a unique living situation that
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:46.080]   can cut your expenses significantly. I hate much of the modern seminary system that spits
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:56.440]   out newly minted and certified and ordained preachers with debt, with college debt, just
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.360]   like the secular world spits out newly minted students with college debt. I hate it. I think
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:06.800]   it's a terrible plan. And the biggest cost, there's two ways to attack it. There is, number
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.480]   one, the discussion of the actual cost of the seminary program, and number two, there
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.520]   is the cost of living expenses. And if nothing else, I think that one of the most important
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.800]   places, ways for churches to be involved with supporting students who have decided to go
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:29.320]   to seminary is at the very least to provide housing and to provide opportunities. So whether
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:35.440]   that's maybe somebody can put a fifth wheel camper on their, you know, behind the barn,
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.020]   or if there's somebody who has a big enough house where they've got an extra wing where
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:43.560]   you and your wife can live. If you only have small children, that's a lot easier than if
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:49.880]   you have larger children. But I think that you should look to take advantage of support
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:57.720]   within the church for your living expenses. And if you can cut that rent to down significantly,
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   it dramatically changes the whole scenario.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:07.160]   For those who are interested in seminary, one of the most inspiring articles, I will
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.320]   make a note here and write about it, but one of the most inspiring articles I've ever read
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:20.040]   on the subject of seminary was by Joel McDermott on the American Vision website. He wrote an
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:26.520]   article titled "Bachelor's Degree, BA to PhD for Under $15,000 Total – How I Did
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.800]   It." And he explains his path to, through his bachelor's degree, master's degree,
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:39.960]   and PhD, wherein he was able to go to school, get his doctorate in theology with, in total,
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:46.440]   his cost was less than $15,000. That doesn't cover some of the challenges of living expenses,
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.460]   but it does at least cover and talk about some of the challenges and expenses relating
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:56.480]   to classes. I found it a really inspirational article. I will link it on today's, in today's
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.480]   show.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.480]   Curtis in Spokane, welcome to Radical Personal Finance. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:08.080]   Thank you, Josh, for taking my call, a long-time listener. So my wife and I, we've been married
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:18.400]   for just about two years now. We're pretty much settled on making a move to Hawaii within
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:26.120]   the next two or three years. The thing that I wanted to ask you about is, A, how viable
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:36.880]   is it to be financially independent in paradise? Obviously, the cost of living is substantially
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:45.800]   higher there. Rent, housing, food costs, you name it. I can give you a little bit of background
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.920]   as to why we want to make this move.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.920]   Yeah, please do.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:54.800]   If that helps. Yeah, so we got married a couple years ago. There's a lot of things that are
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:05.440]   currently going on in our lives. Her mother had colorectal cancer. She passed away about
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:13.280]   a year ago. And then my mother right now currently has pancreatic cancer. So we've been doing
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:20.040]   a lot of caregiving and we absolutely love doing it. It's just, I don't know if you've
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:27.280]   had to care for a loved one with cancer before, but it's very, it's a challenging process
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:33.040]   with all the, just the ups and downs that you would expect from taking care of a parent
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:40.760]   in those type of situations. Although our marriage is wonderful. It's fantastic. We've
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:48.640]   just had a lot of bumps in the road just from that perspective. And my wife, she's from,
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:56.560]   actually she's from Thailand and she, our climate here in Spokane is not conducive to
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:02.120]   our lifestyle. There's just not a lot of things for us that we enjoy currently in the city
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:07.800]   and we want to move somewhere that's more reflective of what we want to do on a daily
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:16.600]   basis. Hence why we want to move to Hawaii, just because of the environment, the lifestyle,
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:22.640]   the culture. We visited Maui a couple of times in the last two years and absolutely loved
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.640]   it.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:30.760]   So I guess to me, I would answer the question in this way. The scenario you're describing
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:44.000]   is a matter of prioritization. If you need to get to Hawaii for a break, for an opportunity
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.960]   to rejuvenate after this difficult time of your life, and it's compatible with your and
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:58.280]   your wife's lifestyle goals and for her own health and happiness, she needs a change.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:07.400]   So to me, those things are all way more compelling and way more important than financial independence.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.640]   If you think about it, if – let's just focus in on the fact that your wife doesn't
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:17.640]   like Spokane, is miserable there. If you spend the next 10 years and your wife is miserable
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:24.320]   living in Spokane, but you get rich, just so that finally you can go and be happy. So
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:30.840]   speaking broadly with these terms, of course, I think that's a dumb plan. If a simple
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.960]   move can help significantly to bring more happiness and peace to your marriage, in my
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.060]   mind that's absolutely the way to go.
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:45.200]   So I wouldn't look at it in terms of yes or no, should I go or shouldn't I go? I
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.080]   would look at it and say these things are more important. You need to – your goal
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:56.180]   is to be in Hawaii. One component of financial freedom that is very valuable is to focus
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:01.300]   in on lifestyle first. I think one of the key things to do is to purchase some of those
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:06.160]   basic lifestyle components as early as you can. The biggest ones is location. If you
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.980]   know where you want to be and you're not there, get to where you want to be as quickly
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.160]   as you can.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:16.460]   Then once you're there, start to make a new plan toward financial independence. Start
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:21.900]   to make a new plan toward figuring out how can I live inexpensively, increase my income
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:27.660]   substantially and save the difference until I can live on the cash flow from my investments.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.980]   I think it's possible to pursue financial independence in just about any context, living
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:37.340]   just about anywhere. But your plan will change depending on the context that you choose.
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:41.340]   If you choose to live in an expensive place to live, then you will have to look at it
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.220]   and say, "Well, how can I accommodate this plan?"
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:50.580]   Here will be a couple of comments. Number one, expense is relative. Many times you will
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:57.740]   find that a place that costs more will also have higher incomes because costs are going
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:02.140]   to be related to income. So you may have more economic opportunities when living in a place
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.500]   that's expensive than you do in a place that's cheap.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.580]   I love the country. I like to live out in the country and Mississippi is a beautiful
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:14.340]   state. But there aren't as many opportunities, financial opportunities to earn a lot of money
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:19.020]   in a physical job living in Mississippi as there are in New York City. So there's a reason
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:25.200]   for the difference in cost. This balance can be changed and kind of brought a little bit
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.720]   out of whack when you live in a place where a lot of people are retirees or when you live
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.460]   in a place where people earn their income from abroad. That does change things. But
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.300]   still, there's got to be some connection between wages and cost of living.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:43.660]   The next thing is every place that you choose to live will have some offsetting features
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:50.420]   that you can look at. So Hawaii might have expensive rent, but you might have a climate
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:55.300]   that doesn't require as much energy use. Energy is expensive in Hawaii, so I got to be careful
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:59.700]   there. But maybe you don't need air conditioning quite so much. Or maybe there's a way that
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.780]   you can figure out how to get your food less expensively.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.540]   And so how I would approach it is I would start by saying we've gone through the process
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:11.700]   of saying this is important to us. We want to make this lifestyle change. Let's figure
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.340]   out how to make the transition. And then once we're there, how can we intelligently handle
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:21.100]   all of the details that are there? There may be some sacrifice involved. Maybe you say
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.340]   we were living in the city, but we found an opportunity to live on a farm where they'll
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:28.340]   give us – we're going to live on an organic food farm in the mountains and they'll give
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:32.360]   us discounted rent in exchange for labor. That would be a really great thing for us
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.340]   to go and do for a year while we get our feet under us, give us a time to spend out, spend
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:42.220]   time outside working on a farm while we figure out what our next step is. Or maybe you share
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.500]   a house with other people so that you can cut your expenses, et cetera. You can figure
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.820]   out a way once you're clear on what you want to do.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:53.220]   And then my other encouragement would be remember, incomes are not fixed. There are lots of ways
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:57.580]   to make money. And if you have a goal that's important to you, you can probably find a
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:01.860]   way to increase your income substantially towards that goal.
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:10.740]   Okay, that's great advice. Yeah, we've – I've done a lot of research on the economics of
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:17.420]   Hawaii and it seems like for the last at least five to ten years that wages have remained
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:24.660]   relatively flat while the housing market has escalated quite substantially. So jobs, at
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:34.580]   least in terms of income, have been difficult even for the locals to afford even their mortgages.
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:41.180]   But yes, to give you some background, our current household income right now is about
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:50.420]   $115,000 a year, about $40,000 in cash, with about $60,000 in Roth, IRA, and traditional
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:22:03.220]   401(k)s. Our current value of our house currently is about $280,000 and we owe about $185,000.
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.780]   I guess one thing we did consider is if we did move, we could sell the house, but we
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:16.500]   could potentially rent that out as well at about $2,300, with our current mortgage payment
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:28.300]   at $1,350 per month. So – and we also run a local business in the city and just based
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:35.100]   on a rough number we could potentially sell that for $100,000. So I guess with all that
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:45.560]   information at hand, would it be wise to purchase a home and be house poor in Hawaii or would
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:50.220]   you still suggest trying to rent for the first year or so and then figure out what we want
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.220]   to do?
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:57.860]   Paul Shufflett: If you don't know Hawaii, I would be slow to buy quickly. If you know
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:04.140]   Hawaii, then certainly you can consider it. But everything you're describing to me, basically
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:10.180]   what you described is the fact that you and your family could move with no debt and $300,000
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:15.580]   in the bank. You can set up a new life anywhere and figure out your next steps. You can – that
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:22.140]   – you have a level of financial independence that makes almost any lifestyle choice accessible
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:28.980]   to you because of your careful planning and work over the years. So you have the ability
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.980]   to do that.
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.660]   Now the specific details, should you open a business there? Should you get a job? Should
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.180]   you buy a house? Should you not? I don't know. In general, I think it's probably a
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:44.580]   bad idea to buy a house with – it's a bad idea to buy a house quickly and here would
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.060]   be a couple of reasons why.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:51.580]   Number one, you're not sure the neighborhoods. You probably may not even be sure which island
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:56.420]   you want to be on and all real estate is local. It takes a little time to be in a place to
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.500]   understand the culture of a specific neighborhood to see is this the type of neighborhood that
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.580]   we want to be in. That's just standard. So in general, if you can find a rental, in
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.780]   general, it's always a good idea to rent for a little bit until you decide where you
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:09.780]   actually want to be.
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:14.540]   Number two, you're just describing coming off of a season of life of great pain and
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:19.620]   great work and you've described that your wife probably needs some time to rest and
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:28.220]   to heal. I wouldn't want to be making long-term decisions with regard to housing in that context.
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:32.700]   I don't want to give her some time to heal and to rest and then to make sure that we're
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.740]   making clear-headed decisions.
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:39.340]   Number three, you're moving, making a huge move and you don't know if the lifestyle is
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:45.340]   actually suitable to you. Maybe island living is all you've dreamed of and maybe island
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:53.140]   living is not for you. So it's best to make small commitments until you're really confident
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.260]   and sure. I've known lots of people who have moved someplace and, "Hey, this is going
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.700]   to be great," and then all of a sudden a few months in, they start to realize, "No,
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:04.340]   this is not so great." And if you can minimize the cost of those decisions to extricate yourself,
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.300]   I think it's wise.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:12.420]   And then number four, take a look at the trend of housing in a particular area. If what you're
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.180]   describing to me about Hawaii real estate is true, you want to be very careful about
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.300]   buying in. Who knows if it will continue to go up or who knows if it will continue to
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:24.940]   go down, but I do think you should be careful about buying in. So for those reasons, I would
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.740]   move pretty slowly.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.740]   Any final follow-up questions, Curtis, before I go on to my next caller?
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.780]   No, that's great. Thank you, Joshua.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:38.860]   Great. Well, thank you to listen to the show and I appreciate the question. It's an awesome
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:45.580]   position that you're in. And I would just emphasize to other listeners, notice how independent
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:50.340]   Curtis and his wife already are. In the financial situation they described, no, they can't – they
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.220]   don't have three million bucks in the bank to spit out money that they can just sit back
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:26:00.060]   and live on, but there's no life decision that is – that's out of their reach. There's
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.940]   nothing that they can't change lifestyle-wise. And those lifestyle changes are the first
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:10.340]   most valuable aspects of financial independence. The process of being able to live on the income
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.940]   from investments will come later.
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:16.540]   Nathan in Pennsylvania, you're up next. Welcome to Radical Personal Finance. How can I serve
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.540]   you today, please?
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:24.180]   Hey, Josh. Thanks for taking my call. Had a couple of life changes recently. Wanted
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:34.860]   to get your opinion on it. So changing jobs, moving a couple of states away. And I have
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:42.620]   – so we had two houses. I had a house that we owned and we rented just south in another
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:49.500]   state about an hour south of us. Long-term renters in that house, they told us recently
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:27:00.660]   that they would be moving. We basically – sorry. So we sold our house that we're in now and
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:10.500]   we'll get probably about $60,000 cash back to us on this. The house that we own about
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:16.660]   an hour south of us is paid off. It was our first house that we moved into. And it was
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:21.380]   – we moved north when the market was bad. So we decided to keep it and rent it. Had
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:29.220]   really good renters. Good experience renting. So really what we're looking at is in a few
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:35.660]   years possibly coming back to that area. And we don't know whether to sell the house to
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:44.340]   keep it. We're not sure of the tax implications. And if we did sell it, not sure what we would
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:49.980]   do with that money, whether to invest it. I know the market's really high. So it makes
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:56.260]   me a little nervous putting all that in the market high. Not sure exactly what to do with
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.260]   that.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.220]   How much is the house worth?
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.620]   Probably about $185,000.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.620]   And do you remember how much?
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.620]   Maybe $190,000.
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:06.620]   And you paid for it?
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:11.500]   Yes. $115,000.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:17.900]   If you moved back to that area, would you want to live in that house again?
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:24.460]   It's not a bad house. It was more of a starter home. We would be okay living in it for a
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:33.020]   couple of years to not pay the capital gains. There's no guarantee of getting back in that
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:39.900]   area, but it sounds pretty promising that a position would open up with the company
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:52.220]   that I started working at. If not, I could always find another job in that area. And
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:56.220]   I can give you background information on our situation too.
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:02.620]   Yeah, that's probably enough. So the two decision factors that jump out at me in this decision
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:10.180]   is one, the rental and the challenge of managing a rental from abroad or from another state,
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:15.620]   from farther away. And number two is the capital gains. So that's the tax question. Is it worth
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:22.900]   going around? So number one, the rental. If you didn't own the house today, would you
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:28.100]   buy a rental house two states away and in the neighborhood and the type of house that
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:32.180]   this house is?
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:37.540]   Probably not, unless it was a really good deal I couldn't walk away from. But I probably
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.020]   wouldn't seek it out, yes.
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:46.020]   At $185,000, would you buy a house like this one? Would that be a really good deal?
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.460]   No.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:53.420]   Okay. So just kind of a simple way of trying to get to the heart of the matter of zero-based
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:58.140]   thinking. If you wouldn't do it again today, then you probably should be careful about
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:04.380]   continuing to do it. Now, that question ignores the embedded tax liability, because the only
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:10.940]   reason that you don't want to put it on the market right now and sell it for $185,000
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:15.060]   is that you're saying, "Well, I've been out of it, so now it's not my primary residence.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:19.140]   Now I'm going to have to pay the tax on the gain of the property." So what you need to
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:24.780]   do is you need to calculate the embedded tax liability in the property. If you did sell
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:30.980]   it today at $185,000, calculate the sales costs, how much are you going to lose in realtor
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:35.540]   fees, et cetera. Probably get a market analysis done by a local real estate agent so you have
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:42.180]   an accurate idea of what you think it would sell for. And then calculate how much tax
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:47.180]   you'll owe on the sale. You have to figure out and calculate what is your modified adjusted
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:53.060]   basis in the property, how much you paid for it, how much your actual basis is today based
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:58.100]   on the fact that you've rented it out, and then calculate what the tax that you would
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.380]   owe would be on the sale and then ask yourself that question again.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:06.460]   Let me just use some simple numbers. Let's say that on the sale of it, you can sell it
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:16.180]   for $185,000. Let's say that your sales costs are eight grand. So let's use 10 grand for
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:26.980]   round numbers, $10,000 of sales costs and $15,000 of tax, capital gains tax on your
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:31.700]   gain when you figure out what you've actually benefited from it. So now let's say instead
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:36.940]   of clearing $185,000, you're going to clear $150,000. So calculate that math and then
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:43.580]   ask yourself the question again. Would I buy this house for $150,000? If so, is that a
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:48.900]   great deal? Well, if it's not, then you should consider going ahead and just taking the profit.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:53.220]   Because as you said, the reason you didn't want to sell it when you moved was because
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:58.020]   the market was down, but the market has been up. So we've got to do a little guessing.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:01.940]   Do you think the market has more room to run locally? Are the trends strong or do you feel
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:06.180]   like we're at a strong point where it might be good to go ahead and sell it?
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:11.620]   I think the market's going to be strong. There's a lot of major companies coming in there.
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:22.020]   And in the last three months, it's went up considerable, probably 15% jump.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:26.780]   So that's significant. That's really important for you to pay attention to. But you've got
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:31.100]   to consider it and do the analysis and run the numbers and then ask yourself that question.
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:35.660]   Do I think this house is going to be worth more in the future?
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:41.280]   Now number two, if you move back, I think your biggest risk here is lifestyle. It would
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:46.620]   be unusual for many families who purchased a starter home and then moved out of the starter
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:52.860]   home into what I presume is probably a nicer home to want to move back to the starter home
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:58.100]   and to be content with that from a lifestyle perspective. That would be unusual.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:02.740]   Now I like unusual, but you've got to ask the question, ask your wife, would we really
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:07.140]   be willing to move into this starter home again? Would we really be excited about it?
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:14.700]   And then what you can do is calculate the tax savings because in my understanding of
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:22.420]   the ownership and use rule that would help you to avoid the tax on the sale of a house,
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:29.640]   if you move back into the house, the two rules are that you have to own and occupy a house
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:36.440]   as your principal residence for at least two years before you sell it and you have to have
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:45.520]   it for at least two years out of the previous five. So you've got to have both of those
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.600]   things as your – you must have used the home as your principal residence for at least
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.580]   two out of the five years before the sale.
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:58.660]   So I think you could run this scenario where you could move back there. It's your principal
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:04.000]   residence, declare it as such, and then you go ahead and sell it and then you have the
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.040]   tax-free gain. But that's going to come with a lifestyle cost. So it might be worth
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:13.720]   it. But – and the question is, ask your wife, how much do you value this tax-free
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:18.560]   money that we can get? Is it worth it? Are we actually going to do that?
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.660]   Michael Munger Right. So we have talked about that and we
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:32.280]   are pretty weird. The last five years, we've changed our lifestyle considerably, kind of
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:41.000]   got onto different people's forums. Mr. Money Mustache and JL Collins found you not
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.720]   too long ago. So all of the – well, actually, it all started with Dave Ramsey, I think,
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:52.620]   similar to your story a little bit, I think, if I remember it. But I guess maybe graduated
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:57.080]   up from that, but give him a lot of credit. He got it started.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:02.600]   So my wife is pretty excited at least the potential of what it's done so far and
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:09.000]   where it's going. It wouldn't be an endgame, but we see the potential with the growth.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.140]   But we're not – I would say we're not emotionally attached to it or anything like
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:21.480]   that. But I guess if we did decide to sell it, because it's kind of on the fence with
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:29.040]   it, I really am struggling where to put it. Because if we sell our current house and where
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:35.080]   we're going, we're going to rent for – we're probably going to rent the few years
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:40.480]   we expect to be there because we don't think financially it would be worth buying.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.000]   And we don't want to put roots down there and make it more difficult to leave. So if
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.600]   we sell that and we have this, we'll probably have about $120,000 in cash. And if we sell
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:57.720]   the other one, let's say we clear, I would say conservatively, $150,000, that's a lot
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:06.200]   of cash. And I'm just not sure what to do with it, which sounds crazy, I guess. But
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:10.800]   I'm nervous about putting it all in the market all at once at record highs.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   Yeah, we'll just put it in a bank and wait until you find a good opportunity.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.480]   That's my plan if I don't think of anything else to do.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:25.540]   This is a big pet peeve of mine and not picking on you but you're expressing the thing.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:30.720]   People have a fear of having just money sitting in the bank and I don't get it. When we're
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.800]   talking a short-term perspective, having money sitting in the bank is not a problem. And
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:44.120]   by short-term, I mean a few years. There's no reason to worry about what to do with money
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.840]   on the short term. The best thing to do if you don't know what to do with it is just
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:54.400]   keep it safe, put it in the bank and leave it alone and wait until you have an opportunity
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.000]   where something will come along.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.240]   If you imagine just about any scenario, you think back in two, three, four-year chunks
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:08.680]   of your life, it's very common in most people's lives that in two, three or four-year chunks,
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:13.160]   you'll find a good use of money. That may be that there's a correction in the stock
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.680]   market and you say, "You know what? I'm going to buy in." That may be that there's a change
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.200]   in the housing market and you say, "This is a time for us to go ahead and pull the trigger
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:25.240]   and buy this particular type of house." That may be you have an idea for a business or
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:30.360]   you have a friend of yours that you want to engage in some kind of private investment,
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:34.800]   but there's no reason for you not to just put the money in the bank and that shouldn't
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:39.240]   be a reason for you to keep the money in real estate.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.440]   If you want the money in real estate, you can always just – if it's a good time to
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:47.920]   sell this house and take your profits and you want this particular part of your portfolio
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:52.240]   to be invested in real estate, you can always find another house to put it into. But there's
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:57.560]   no – you shouldn't be scared of putting $300,000 in the bank, letting it sit there
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:01.360]   for two, three, four years until you find something good to do with it.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.440]   Michael: Perfect.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:09.600]   Tavis: Yeah. It's a big psychological thing that I think people face, but when you have
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:15.480]   money I think you'll find that there are plenty of people that want to help you invest
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.560]   it as time goes on.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:23.000]   All right. Last caller for today, Josh in Illinois. Welcome to the show. How can I serve
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   you today?
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.520]   Josh: Yeah. Hey, I was hoping I could ask two questions. I think one's going to be
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.680]   really easy for you.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.360]   Tavis: Go for it. I like easy.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:36.080]   Josh: All right. Great. So I've just been listening for a few weeks and I started with
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.200]   the most recent shows and I jumped back with some of the older ones and I came across a
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.920]   couple of shows about the cash flow statement and the financial condition, statement of
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:49.480]   financial condition. I kind of wanted to do that, but I was hoping I could take a look
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:55.400]   at your template, but it's not there anymore and I wasn't sure if there's a way to get
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.360]   access to it. It expired in the show notes or something, that document.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.680]   Tavis: Yeah. That was an old link and I do need to replace the document. It's on my
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:08.160]   list of things that I need to do. But to make it just very simple, in the audio of that
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:13.520]   show, I described how to do it. Again, I should go ahead and re-upload those templates and
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:21.040]   fix some of those old shows with those minor details. But don't let seeing something else
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.880]   intimidate you. For your statement of financial condition, you just simply write down a list
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:31.960]   of all your assets and group them according to kind. Group your real estate assets together,
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.880]   group your investment assets together, group your cash assets together, group your tangible
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:43.040]   assets together and then list your liabilities and just write it out. You can do it on a
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:48.800]   legal pad, et cetera. With your statement of cash flows, top of the page, just write
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:53.440]   out or top of the spreadsheet, write out your total gross income and then systematically
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:59.720]   pull out each of the categories and calculate how much you pay in categories. Put your employment
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:05.200]   taxes, put your federal income taxes, put any other deductions that you have from your
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.440]   paycheck. So figure out how to get from your gross income to your net income and then start
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:15.080]   listing your household expenses. So if you understood just the basic outline of it, you
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:20.680]   can do it. But yes, it is on my list that I do need to fix that document for the old
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.680]   file.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.640]   Preston Pysh (00:36:40): Right. Yeah. No, and I've created both of
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.320]   my own versions in Excel. I just kind of wanted to take a look at yours.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.800]   Trey Lockerbie (00:36:46): You're a spreadsheet nerd. You want to see
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   my spreadsheets.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.800]   Preston Pysh (00:36:49): Oh, I love them. I love them. I got spreadsheets
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:41.440]   for everything. Hey, my other question was, I guess the short version of the question
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:49.680]   is do you have any exposure to or any thoughts on these sort of medical bill sharing organizations
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:54.360]   as a substitute for health insurance? The one that I'm familiar with is called Samaritan
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:58.680]   Ministries. It's sort of a Christian base. You pay a certain amount every month, but
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:02.880]   you, instead of sending it to a health insurance company or something like that, you send checks
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.600]   to people that have bills. And I don't know if you know anything about that, but the reason
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:14.560]   I'm asking is because I'm trying to transition my wife out of her job by some other side
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.960]   of the family business and stuff that I'm doing. And so she can be home, but her health
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:24.080]   care is great and we're going to lose it obviously if she quits. So I'm just looking at other
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:29.280]   alternatives and that's one of them, but I've never really heard anybody from outside of
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:33.040]   the organization be able to critique them. I don't know if you had any knowledge on that
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.040]   or thoughts on that.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.600]   Trey Lockerbie (00:37:22): Back in December of 2016, I did a series on
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:46.280]   health insurance. Episode 393 was part one and then it continued on through that series.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:51.360]   In episode 403, I talked about, it was called the health insurance series part four, how
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:57.320]   to avoid and evade the Obamacare tax penalty. I introduced in that show, episode 403, I
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:04.240]   introduced the concept of health care sharing ministries. And then episode 404 of the show
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:09.280]   is called the health insurance series part five, health care sharing ministries. This
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.640]   is how we pay for our health care costs in the Sheetz family. And then episode 405 was
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.640]   the health care sharing ministries wrap up with a few additional comments. I'll give
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.560]   you the short version of those shows in answer to your question.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:25.120]   Trey Lockerbie (00:38:02): I love the health care sharing ministry model.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:30.720]   There are a number of good ones. Samaritan Ministries is the one that my family and I
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:37.320]   use, but there are other good ones as well. There's Liberty Health Share. There are four
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:41.880]   big ones. Can I do this off the top of my head? I don't have it off the top of my head.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.920]   I would need to go and find my notes, but an episode of, oh, here we go. In the notes
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:52.000]   for episode 404 of my show, there's Christian Healthcare Ministries. Then there's MediShare,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.160]   also Liberty Health Share and Altrua Health Share. So the biggest ones, or the Liberty
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:02.080]   Health Share is more well-known now because they've been advertising aggressively in some
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.760]   of the right-wing conservative political space. Christian Healthcare Ministries is very large,
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.560]   and so is MediShare and then Samaritan Ministries as well.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:15.160]   I like Samaritan. I have nothing but good things to say about health care sharing ministries.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:23.520]   I love the model. I love the concept, and I have been thoroughly pleased with our participation
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:28.360]   in the Samaritan Ministries model of health care sharing ministries. I don't think they're
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:32.720]   for everyone. The couple things that you need to look out for is, number one, there is an
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:38.920]   ideological and religious statement of – basically a statement of faith that you have to affirm
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:44.080]   to be able to participate. That statement of faith ranges from very liberal and inclusive
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:53.520]   to very conservative and exclusive across those companies. So for example, Liberty Health
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:58.200]   Share requires you to affirm a statement of faith that is very inclusive, almost kind
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:02.600]   of the American civil religion. You affirm that there is a god of some kind, but you
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:09.160]   don't necessarily have to make too many specifications about what that god is or means,
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:15.200]   and it's much more kind of the American civil religion, god, freedom, etc. That ranges.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:19.440]   Samaritan Ministries on the other hand, their statement of faith is very exclusive. It's
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:23.800]   very tight. It's a Trinitarian confession of faith, and it's very, very careful in
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:28.680]   its approach. So not everybody can endorse such a statement of faith, and so that's
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:36.640]   why they're excluded. So for a listener who can't endorse one of those statements
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:42.640]   of faith as required for membership, they would have to find another option for them.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.720]   But I love it. We've loved Samaritan Ministries. I love with Samaritan Ministries that the
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:51.360]   checks don't come from the centralized organization. We had – this last year, my wife and I had
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:45:01.260]   a child, and every dollar of the cost of childbirth was paid for out from the healthcare sharing
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:07.320]   ministry organization, and it all came in with very nice checks from our fellow participants
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:13.260]   in the plan, accompanied with beautiful notes and congratulations and notes of encouragement
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:20.360]   and scripture verses, etc. It was a very refreshing experience after years of dealing with a cold
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:24.880]   insurance company at the other end of the line. But it's not without risk. So that's
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:29.640]   my answer. I love it. We have – I heartily endorse these organizations. We've found
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:36.440]   it to be very inexpensive and to – well, to be very reasonable in terms of the cost.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:42.760]   For our family of five, our monthly share cost is $495 a month, and so that's very,
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.960]   very reasonable considering the benefits that we get.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:49.920]   Michael Myre: Great. So I should have just done a search on your website basically.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:55.720]   Ted Whitten: I try to keep the website useful to work with search, but sometimes it's
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.380]   a little overwhelming and I don't do as good of a job as possible. But yes, go and
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:02.680]   listen to those episodes of the show, and I think especially episode 404, and it'll
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:07.520]   give you the comprehensive treatment. Any specific questions on Samaritan Ministries
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.320]   or the concept in general?
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:15.080]   Ted Whitten: I mean, not really. I think almost about half the people I know here in Peoria
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:20.640]   area work for the company, so I'm not really lacking information about Samaritan Ministries.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:27.000]   It's just kind of wanted to get an outsider's viewpoint. So that kind of confirms some of
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   my thoughts.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.160]   So the only – I guess the final kind of light that I could add would be in terms of
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:39.000]   deciding and thinking through which option to go with, which company to go with, I find
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.220]   them all to be competitive with one another in terms of premiums, et cetera. I think the
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:51.320]   biggest difference would be a couple of things. Number one, that confession of faith that
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:56.520]   you would have to affirm upon membership. That will be a big thing.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:06.480]   Number two, there may be some specific coverage for a specific thing that would guide you
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.640]   from one to another. For example, the thing that put me over the top for Samaritan Ministries
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:16.500]   was twofold. One, I liked the fact that the money doesn't go through the central disbursement
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:21.640]   account, but it comes directly from fellow participants. I like that because it feels
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:26.860]   very much like the community sharing approach. But another one was for me, Samaritan Ministries
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:35.160]   had a specific option in their plan and in their guidelines where they said that with
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:41.460]   regard to tobacco use, that an occasional celebratory cigar was expressly permitted.
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:45.220]   All of the rest of them have – when I was doing the research, all the rest of them had
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:49.680]   a complete blanket prohibition against any tobacco use and they didn't discriminate
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:55.440]   between cigarettes and cigars, pipes, etc. There's a huge difference in terms of the
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:00.860]   health risk from a daily pack of cigarettes versus an occasional pipe or an occasional
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:06.560]   cigar and I enjoy an occasional celebratory cigar. So I found – would have found it
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:11.080]   frustrating to have that choice excluded from me by joining one of the others.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.920]   But in the Samaritan Ministries guidelines, they had a specific exception for – with
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:19.320]   regard to tobacco use, an occasional celebratory cigar was permitted. So that was just a minor
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:23.580]   thing that when I was reading through all the guidelines was valuable and important
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:24.580]   for me.
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:28.320]   So if you listen to that show and if you read the various guidelines to the different companies,
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:33.240]   I think you'll find them. The final thing would be each company has a different maximum
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:40.020]   cap on their coverage. So not all medical – unlike traditional health insurance under
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:45.660]   today's Affordable Care Act compliant plans which has no maximum out of pocket – sorry,
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:50.240]   no maximum limit to the plan. The plan if you have a $20 million medical expense, the
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:56.760]   plan will pay for. Christian Healthcare Sharing Ministries do indeed have a max, have a maximum
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.600]   cap. Now it can range as high as I believe the highest is a million bucks but you would
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:05.400]   need to read among them and decide what's the appropriate setup for me. But we've
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.400]   loved it.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:12.120]   And if you do join Samaritan Ministries, mention to them please that Joshua Sheets sent you.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.680]   Joshua Sheets is spelled S-H-E-A-T-S. Tell them Joshua Sheets sent you and then I will
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:23.320]   get on my next statement, I'll get a reduction in my bill. So that's nice. And that's
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:29.240]   not something that's exclusive for me. I need to start advertising that more on Radical
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.800]   Personal Finance because it would be very helpful to have dozens and dozens of you signing
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:37.600]   up with Samaritan Ministries every month and telling them that Joshua Sheets sent you because
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:44.760]   that would help me with my monthly share amount. But anytime you're a member of, well
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:49.140]   these were Samaritan Ministries and the others I think have equivalent programs as well,
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:52.440]   you can just simply share it with your friends and if you share it with your friends you'll
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:50:00.600]   find that they will give you a discount on your next bill as a referral fee. I think
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:04.120]   that's really nice and it's very, very helpful. So those of us who have a platform
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:07.800]   should share it. So if you're interested in Christian Healthcare Sharing Ministries,
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:13.560]   go to episode 404 of the show, listen to it. I can heartily endorse the approach. In that
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:17.640]   show I talk about who it may not be right for, just as I've just done, but in general
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.520]   if you can affirm the statement of faith and if you're looking for a consistent, reliable
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:26.560]   way to pay for your healthcare costs, that may work for you. If you choose Samaritan
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:30.360]   Ministries, tell them Joshua Sheets sent you and I would greatly appreciate that. Thank
