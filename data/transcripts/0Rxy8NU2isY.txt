[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, the grace of God is absolutely free.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   And it will also cost you everything.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   And balancing this out is a trick.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   As we hear in today's question from a young preacher named Ryan,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   a leader who listens to the podcast.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Ryan writes in, Pastor John says this, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   I'm stumped as to how to preach two truths.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   One, people cannot work to be saved.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Christ did all the work for them and now they must trust in him.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Number two, I want them to realize following Jesus is costly
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   and not an easy path of self-indulgence.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Can you give me any hopes for explaining that Christ is both free,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   as Isaiah 55, 1 says, and will also cost us everything,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   like the treasure in the field in Matthew 13, 44?"
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Pastor John, what would you say to Ryan?
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   I very much enjoyed thinking about this question.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And I'm eager to say what I've been thinking
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   because I think it sheds a lot of light on the nature of salvation.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   So here's what I need to do.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Just to make things more precise, I'm going to rephrase the question.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And you'll see why.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   When Ryan says Christ is free and yet costs everything,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   the word Christ there is shorthand, I think,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   for enjoying God through Christ as our all-satisfying friend forever.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Enjoying God through Christ as our all-satisfying friend forever.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   That's what we get when we get Christ.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   That's what Christ offers to say you get Christ or you come to Christ.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   That's what you come to.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   You come to God through Christ and find your all-satisfying friend forever.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   So the paradox that Ryan is concerned about would go like this.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Enjoying God through Christ as our all-satisfying friend forever
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   is free and costs you everything.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Now, with that paraphrase, I think we can explain the paradox.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   There are two massive obstacles that have to be overcome
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   before I can enjoy God through Christ as my all-satisfying friend forever.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   The first obstacle is called legal.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   It's a legal one, namely that God outside of Christ is not my friend.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   He's my enemy, holy, just, righteous judge who sees me as a guilty sinner.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   That is the main obstacle that has to be overcome, God's just and holy wrath.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   He's not my friend.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   If I get brought into his presence, I get incinerated.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I don't get happy.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   The second obstacle we could call emotional or moral.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   First one's legal.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   This one is emotional, namely,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I don't find God all-satisfying.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I don't see him as beautiful or supremely desirable in my natural state.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   In fact, I prefer other things for my satisfaction.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I have exchanged the glory of God for images and other things.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Those are the two obstacles that have to be overcome
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   if I'm going to enjoy God through Christ as my all-satisfying friend forever.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Overcoming one would make him my friend.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Overcoming the other would make him all-satisfying.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Maybe you can see now where this is leading.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   God takes the initiative to overcome both of these obstacles
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   so that we can enjoy him through Christ as an all-satisfying friend forever.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   He does it first by the work of justification
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and second by the work of sanctification.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   In justification, God pays the debt of our sin through the blood of Christ
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and cancels our guilt and satisfies his holy wrath against sin
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and imputes to us the righteousness of Christ
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   so that now God is totally for us, totally merciful to us.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   He is our friend forever.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   You can see it in texts like Galatians 3.13.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   The curse of God landed on Jesus and not on us.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Or Isaiah 53.5.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   He was pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   The crushing of God's just penal wrath fell on Jesus so that it doesn't fall on us.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Or Romans 8.3.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   He, key words, condemned sin in the flesh.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Our sin condemned in Jesus' flesh
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   so there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   God is for us forever.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   He is our friend and our father and our protector and our provider.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Everything from now on will work for our good.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   So the first obstacle is removed to enjoying God through Christ
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   as our all-satisfying friend forever.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   He is our friend forever because of what Christ achieved for his elect.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   That is what Jesus bought.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Now, what about the second obstacle?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   The natural mind is hostile to God.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   He may have overcome his hostility toward us on the cross, but what about ours?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   The natural mind is hostile to God.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   It does not submit to God's law.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It cannot.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Romans 8.7.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   We have exchanged the glory of God for other things.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   We do not by nature enjoy God.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   We enjoy his gifts, not him.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   So if we are to enjoy God through Christ as our all-satisfying friend forever,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   God is going to have to do a second great miraculous redeeming work.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   He will have to take out of us the heart of stone that hates God
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   and put into us the heart of flesh that loves God, delights in God,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   is satisfied in God, treasures God above all things.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   He's going to have to radically change our emotions and our moral preferences.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And that's precisely what he promised to do in the new covenant,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Ezekiel 11, Ezekiel 36, Jeremiah 31,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   and this new covenant of taking out the heart of stone,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   putting in the heart of flesh, causing us to have new affections for God.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Jesus bought that when he shed his blood, according to Luke 22.20.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   So God moves in by his spirit.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Once he has died for us, he moves in by his spirit,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   lays hold on us and causes us to be born again, to believe.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And he takes out the heart of stone.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   He puts in the heart of flesh.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   He opens our eyes to see the beauty of God in Christ
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   as more desirable than anything in the world.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And he overcomes this second obstacle,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   namely our preference for other things in the hardness of our heart.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   So now we got justification, making us friends with God forever
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   by removing his enmity and his wrath and justice.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And we got sanctification, taking out the heart of stone
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   and making us find him all satisfying forever.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   How does that resolve Ryan's perceived contradiction or paradox?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   The treasure of having God as our friend, not our enemy,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   and of having him as all satisfying rather than boring.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   That treasure, the all satisfying friendship of God in Christ forever
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   is totally free, bought for us by the blood of Christ.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   No one can buy the friendship of God.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   No one can buy a new heart that delights in God.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   You can't buy it.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   It has been bought by the blood of Jesus.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   It is free for the having.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   It's free, more specifically, it is free for the enjoying,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   which simply means that to be saved,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   that is to enjoy God through Christ as my all satisfying friend,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I have to enjoy him above all things.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Not less than food or sex or family or fame, not equal with them.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   I have to enjoy him above those things.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   He has to be that sweet and precious.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   He has to be my treasure.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   If I don't enjoy him, he will not be all satisfying to me.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And that is all Jesus meant when he said, Matthew 13, 44,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   an all satisfying treasure, which a man found covered up,"
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   and then here's the key phrase, "in his joy."
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   He now finds this treasure supremely satisfying.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   In his joy, he goes and sells everything he has and buys that field.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   The point of that parable is not that we pay for what Jesus already paid for.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   The point of that parable is that we now prefer the kingdom over everything in this world.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And because we do, and because he gave his life as a ransom for us,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   we now will enjoy God through Christ as our all satisfying friend forever.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   That is gold on the affections.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Pastor John, thank you.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   And Ryan, thank you for the question.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   We always appreciate questions coming in from leaders,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   and we get to three of those questions a week, so we can't get to a lot of them,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   but please continue to send your questions to us.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   We publish three times a week,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   and you can subscribe to our audio feeds, search our episode archive,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   and even reach us by email with a leadership question that you may be facing in your ministry.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   You can do all of that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Well, we have a question from a listener,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   and they want to know if the wedding date is set for a couple,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   is physical intimacy now permissible?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Why or why not?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Well, Pastor John is going to make his case from Scripture,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   and that's how we will start next week.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   I am your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you on Monday.
