[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   All right, we have a question here from Graham.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.140]   Graham says, "How would you recommend
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.480]   "structuring deep work sessions
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.120]   "that require both reading and writing?
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.640]   "For instance, would you find more value
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.140]   "in reading an article or two and then writing,
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.400]   "or writing first to find out
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.200]   "which articles you need to read?"
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.020]   Well, Graham, the way I normally do this
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.180]   is write first, read second,
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.860]   the reading is for the next day.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.280]   So I think the hard thing in writing
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.160]   is the actual writing itself.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.240]   That's where you should start.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.440]   You know, the first deep creative endeavor you do
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.800]   is the writing, and then the reading can be later
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.340]   in the day, because that's more flexible.
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.120]   It could be over lunch break, you can read in the evening,
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.160]   you know, you can sit by the fire, you can sit outside,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.920]   like there's all sorts of different places you can read,
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.160]   it's less cognitively demanding,
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160]   give yourself more breathing room to have insights
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.020]   and to write things down.
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.920]   So that's what I would suggest.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.660]   Other people do it different, write first, read second.
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.140]   And when you're reading, you're reading for writing
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.960]   that's gonna come in the future,
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.220]   not for the writing you're doing right then.
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.460]   (upbeat music)
