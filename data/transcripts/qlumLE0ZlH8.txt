[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Y'all been together?
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Why'd he get on?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   He said he didn't hear that I got a girl.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   I said he can get a girl.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   So y'all, how did he ask you out for the first time?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   You met through mutuals.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Yo, your brother's gotta stop looking over here and like whistling and shit.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   By the way, you have no chance, c'mon boy.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   No, wait, actually, you know what?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Sit down again.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Yo, let's talk about you sitting down.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   That's right.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   What we got going on over here, huh?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   What we got going on over here, huh?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   We're literally talking about you.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Talking about what?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Oh, he's setting me up?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   She was telling me how y'all met, you know what I'm saying?
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   She was talking about how good or what you took care of her.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Yeah, okay.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Ah, you're from New York.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   I like him as fuck, honestly.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Stiney's mad.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   He came in here with all these girls and we're just having a normal conversation and he wants
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   to come in here.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Sure.
