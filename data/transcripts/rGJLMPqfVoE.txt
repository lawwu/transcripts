[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.440]   Today we live in the age of tolerance, a season when the payment due for sin is foreborn.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.400]   The sin debt is not being called in, not yet.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.960]   This is a season, Paul says, to demonstrate the riches of God's kindness in his forbearance
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.040]   and patience with sinners.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.720]   A season of kindness, a kindness that's on purpose, meant to lead you to repentance,
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.120]   as Paul says in Romans 2.4.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.240]   This day of tolerance will end, and when it does, the King of kings, our Savior Jesus
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.680]   Christ, will not be the king who rode into Jerusalem on the humble donkey of Matthew
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.920]   21.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.600]   Our king will return on the white war horse of Revelation 19.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:56.600]   And this king, the once lowly, soon to return in majesty king, is the very king we need.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.800]   Today's sermon clip is about such a king in comparison to all other world rulers, even
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.960]   compared to our presidents.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.640]   At the time of this sermon, George W. Bush was the president, having just completed the
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.480]   first of his eight-year run in the Oval Office.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.040]   Here's Pastor John preaching on Matthew 21 in the spring of 2002, about six months after
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.680]   9/11.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.320]   We have a president, right?
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.320]   Bush, President Bush.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.900]   We don't have a king.
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.920]   So some of this is a little bit foreign to us, but there are kings in the world.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.560]   And when I think king of kings, I think king over presidents, vice presidents, premiers,
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.560]   kings.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.140]   He's the king over all the presidents.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.480]   Now when I think president, now what can George Bush do for me?
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.240]   Well, he's, I think, doing a pretty good job with security and protection.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.240]   That's what he ought to be doing.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.400]   He's the commander in chief.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.680]   He's got to wield the sword, according to Romans 13, appropriately to protect a people.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.480]   And it seems like it's going well.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.880]   I hope he's level-headed and reasonable and thinks through all the options in front of
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.160]   him carefully.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.700]   But you know what?
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.080]   The best he could do for me is keep me safe and sick.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.800]   I'd get sick and die in a safe America, right?
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.920]   He can't make me see.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.840]   He can't make me walk when I'm lame.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.360]   I don't want that kind of king.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.160]   I want a real king.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160]   I want a king of nature.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.280]   I want not just king over politics and king over military might.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.880]   I want a king over molecules and atoms.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.880]   That's the kind of king I want.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.440]   Keith, I'm looking at you.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.640]   My blind brother over here, he knows.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:55.760]   Someday, Keith, someday, maybe in this life, but for sure, for sure, King Jesus is going
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.320]   to touch your eyes, brother.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.760]   And you'll look on him.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.320]   He'll be the first one you see.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.760]   That's the kind of king he is.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.880]   He's a global universal king, king of the universe, king over eyes, king over legs.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.160]   No president, no king on earth is that kind of king.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.320]   We've got the children here in verse 9.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:30.000]   Jesus declares his kingship by the way he responds to what the children and the crowds
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.880]   are doing, the way he responds.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.120]   This is a response issue.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.160]   He doesn't take the initiative here, except that he said it all in motion.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.640]   The priests and the scribes are really bent out of shape about this event.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.560]   They are not happy what's going on here.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.520]   And the children just, that's just too much.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.920]   Verse 9, "Hosanna," this is the crowds, "Hosanna," verse 9, we'll get to the children in verse
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.400]   15, "Hosanna," that means salvation, "to the son of David," that's the hope for king, "blessed
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.120]   is he who comes in the name of the Lord."
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.640]   Now the children, verse 15, "Hosanna, Hosanna to the son of David."
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:26.520]   And these priests say, verse 16, "You hear what these children are saying?"
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:37.000]   Now the implication there is, you better quickly defuse this enthusiasm about you, otherwise
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.880]   you're going to be guilty of blasphemy.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.600]   So what do you say?
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.480]   Now they could be asking the same question about, "What about those cloaks?
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.920]   Didn't you see them throwing cloaks in front of you?"
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.040]   Do you know what that means according to 2 Kings 9, verse 13?
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.040]   That means they're treating you as a king.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.700]   You're going to get the Romans on us, and besides you're not, and so this is a big hoax,
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.560]   this is blasphemy.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.600]   Do you realize what everybody's hollering?
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.120]   And these little children, "Come on, settle this down."
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.920]   That's what they're saying to him.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.200]   Now how does he respond to this?
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.040]   The way he responds to this is absolutely stunning.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.200]   You couldn't have poured more oil on this fire than he pours.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.120]   This is the last straw.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.880]   He answers it with one word, and then a Bible quote.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.880]   Do you hear what they're saying?
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.880]   Greek.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   "Nai."
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.880]   "Nai" means "yes" in Greek.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.880]   "Yes."
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.880]   Pause.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.480]   And then do you know what he quotes?
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.840]   He quotes Psalm 8.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:06.040]   "How majestic is thy name in all the earth.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.000]   Out of the mouth of babes you have appointed praise."
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.120]   That's God.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.840]   That's God.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.520]   Talking about God.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.980]   They're not dumb.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:34.080]   The last straw is, I'll quote some more Scripture for you, and I will take God's Word applied
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:41.800]   to children about the praise of children to God and apply it to me.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.800]   And he's dead.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.960]   He's dead.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.160]   For you.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.720]   So I'm finished, except to try to wrap it up.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:02.040]   There is coming a day when he will come again as king.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.720]   Not on a donkey, but on a white war horse.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.280]   And his hands will not be empty and outstretched.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:20.560]   And the blood on his hands will not be his own blood.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:29.200]   The garment dipped in blood will be the blood dragging through the blood of his enemies.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.720]   The second coming is the end of the day of salvation.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.240]   The second coming is the end of the day of patience.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.160]   The second coming is the end of the day of tolerance.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.240]   And now is the acceptable time.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.360]   Now is the day of salvation.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:08:00.680]   Don't risk meeting King Jesus on the white horse, having rejected him on the donkey.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.080]   And the way to switch sides is like this.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:14.840]   So if you find yourself right now on the wrong side of the war, and king in your life is
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:31.520]   money or food or success or looks or family or job or health or fame, what rules you right
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.780]   now more than Jesus?
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:43.800]   What governs your affections and your choices day by day, hour by hour more than Jesus governs
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.800]   them?
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.480]   He is your King.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.920]   And so the way you come over is that you hear him saying, "I'm your King.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.080]   I'm on a donkey.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.240]   I'm on my way to die for you.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.680]   I will shed my blood that your sins might be forgiven and your treason might be forgotten.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.840]   I hold out amnesty for you.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:11.640]   Anyone who comes, I will receive and forgive and declare you righteous with my own righteousness
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:17.960]   that I'm working out here on this very Palm Sunday and fold you into my redeemed people
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.240]   and you will live forever with ever increasing joy."
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.920]   It's just faith.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.240]   By faith you forsake, by faith you receive him.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.480]   Powerful, especially coming just six months after 9/11.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.360]   We need a king over politics, a king over war, but we also need a king over molecules
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.520]   and atoms, a king who can make the lame walk and the blind see.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.520]   Awesome.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.680]   That was a Palm Sunday sermon preached on March 24, 2002 titled "Jesus Declares His
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.680]   Kingship."
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.360]   This clip was sent in by Ben Westerhoff.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.400]   So thank you, Ben, for that.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.880]   If you have a clip, tell us what bits of Piper's sermons caught your attention.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.160]   Email me, give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.040]   happens in the audio, and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.880]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.440]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.160]   Next time we talk about complementarity in the home.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.120]   It's a really sharp question for every couple to think about.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.120]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.600]   We are rejoined in studio by Pastor John when we return on Friday.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.040]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.540]   [END]
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
