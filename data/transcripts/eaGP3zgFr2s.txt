[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   Well, there are right ways to correct other believers and there are wrong ways to correct
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600]   other believers.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.240]   So, what's the difference?
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.880]   Romans 14, 13 says this, "Therefore, let us not pass judgment on one another any longer,
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.520]   but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother."
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.040]   Here's John Piper explaining the meaning of this point from a 2005 sermon.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.560]   I take judgment, who are you to pass judgment on your brother, to mean two things.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:45.160]   One, don't be critical of your fellow believer without manifesting strong affections of brotherly
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.160]   love.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.240]   You can see how I'm saying it because I'm leaving room for all the texts that say correct
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.840]   one another, admonish one another, rebuke one another.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.480]   You've got to pass judgments if you're going to obey the Bible.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.080]   But this text has got to mean something when it says don't judge.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.680]   And the first thing, I'm picking it out from the word brother.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.920]   See the highlight on the brother.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.560]   Who are you to judge your brother?
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.920]   In other words, be careful here that when you undertake to do some correcting, some
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.480]   admonishing, some rebuking, let brotherhood be all over it.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.280]   Not a spirit of condemnation.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.240]   We created a word for this bad thing.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.240]   Judgmental.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.440]   Where did that word come from?
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.480]   Why was that created in English?
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.560]   This verse, that's why.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.280]   Or something like this verse.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.680]   Everybody knows there's a right time to correct someone and tell them they're doing something
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.040]   a little stupid.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.920]   And there's a way to do it and a wrong time to do it and a way to do it.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.440]   It puffs you up.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.040]   Get the log out.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:02:00.360]   First, then you will see clearly how to take the speck out of your brother's eye.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.840]   Logs in eyes make poor eye surgeons.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.120]   You club people to death with the logs hanging out of your eyes.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.280]   Can you get this picture?
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.800]   Excuse me, there's a speck in your eye.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:24.000]   This is a, probably they were smiling as Jesus used this and then they just collapsed with
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.480]   self-condemnation.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.600]   So the first meaning, I believe, don't judge the one who eats or why are you passing judgment
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:40.860]   on your brother is don't be critical of the fellow believer without manifest affirmation
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.860]   of brotherly affection.
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.360]   If you don't have it, you've got a problem.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.120]   A big problem.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.200]   Here's the second meaning I think it has.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.640]   I think it means in addition, don't treat them as unbelievers.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.520]   Don't pass final judgment on them.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.040]   Don't say to a brother because of some meat thing or vegetable thing or day thing or wine
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.320]   thing, you can't be a Christian.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.320]   You're not a Christian.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.520]   Now here's what I think despising means.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.580]   I take despising, who are you to despise your brother?
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.920]   Why do you despise your brother?
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:27.680]   To mean don't treat your brother scornfully without brotherly affection.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.240]   You know, you roll your eyes and you cluck your tongue and you turn your head and everything
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:41.080]   about your body language is despise and scorn and belittle and disdain.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.880]   And there's nothing brotherly about it.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:52.360]   And so I think the word brother in verse 10 repeated those two times is meant to awaken
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:01.360]   affection that mellows and softens and sweetens any correcting that we need to do of each
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.040]   other.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.960]   So the command is clear.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.400]   I said we start with the command, we move to an argument and then we go.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   The command is clear.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.040]   Don't judge, don't despise your fellow believers by treating them as unbelievers or being critical
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.080]   of them without brotherly affection.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.320]   In other words, when judgment is needed, do it the way Paul said do it in Galatians 6,
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.200]   1 and 2 and do it the way Jesus said do it in Matthew 7, 5.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.080]   Let me read those again.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.320]   Here's Paul's way of interpreting Jesus' command.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:45.320]   "Brothers," this is Galatians 6, 1, "Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression,"
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:52.000]   so there's reason to correct here, "caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual,"
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.080]   you might think spiritual will puff you up.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.680]   That's not spiritual to be puffed up.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.840]   Watch the effect of it.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.440]   "You who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness, keep watch over
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.080]   yourself lest you too be tempted."
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.040]   Log, log, log, log, log.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.200]   And here's Jesus' words, "First take the log out of your own eye and then you will see
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.920]   clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye."
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.160]   You want to invest some emotional energy in conflict?
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.440]   Deal with yourself 99% of the time.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.720]   Save a marriage that way.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.540]   Let's go to the argument.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.880]   The argument is in the second half of verse 10, down through verse 12.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.840]   I'll read it with you.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.560]   Why do you pass judgment, I'm starting at the beginning, why do you pass judgment on
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.520]   your brother, or why do you despise your brother, that is, don't do this, because, here's the
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.400]   argument, because, for, we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:04.400]   And then he grounds that in the Old Testament, Isaiah 45, 23, "For it is written, 'As I live,'
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.240]   says the Lord, 'every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess.'"
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.240]   Now he comes back up to state again, verse 12, "So then, each of us will give an account
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.760]   of himself to God."
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.520]   So he says, two times, two times, he says we'll be judged.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.520]   Verse 10, second half of the verse, "We will all stand before the judgment seat of God."
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.160]   Then he says it again in verse 12, "So then, each of us will give an account of himself
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.640]   to God," and in between those two statements comes the basis of them in the Old Testament,
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.440]   Isaiah 45, 23, "For it is written, 'As I live,' says the Lord, 'every knee shall bow and every
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.000]   tongue shall confess.'"
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.980]   He's picking up on the "every" here.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.240]   So what's he stressing in these three verses?
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.440]   I think he's stressing the words "every," "each," and "all."
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:05.440]   Verse 10, second half of the verse, "We shall all stand before the judgment seat of God,
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.760]   no exceptions."
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:20.080]   Verse 11, "Every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God."
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.400]   And then verse 12, picks another word, says the same thing.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.760]   "So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God."
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.680]   So you've got the word "each," you've got the word "every," you've got the word "all."
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.120]   That's the stress in these three statements.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:50.880]   It means that every single person in the sound of my voice will individually stand before
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:58.160]   the Creator of the universe and give an account of your life.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.340]   Think about that a lot.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.360]   Think about it when you go to bed at night, and think about it when you get up in the
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.360]   morning.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.360]   Sobering.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:15.160]   This clip came in 8,000 miles away from Lawrence, a listener to the podcast in Nairobi, Kenya.

[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.920]   for good.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.120]   We have many resolutions for good in the year ahead, and we want to share those with you.
