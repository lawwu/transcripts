[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   I'm trying to say that whatever consciousness is,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   it's not a computation.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.040]   - Yes.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.700]   - Or it's not a physical process
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.780]   which can be described by computation.
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.300]   - But it nevertheless could be,
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.300]   so one of the interesting models that you've proposed
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.420]   is the orchestrated objective reduction.
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.100]   - Yes, well you see that's going from there, you see.
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.180]   So I say I have no idea.
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.780]   So I wrote this book through my scientific career.
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.100]   I thought, you know, when I'm retired,
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.140]   I'll have enough time to write a sort of a popularish book
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.620]   which I will explain my ideas and puzzles,
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.580]   what I like, beautiful things about physics and mathematics,
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.900]   and this puzzle about computability
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.980]   and consciousness and so on.
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.540]   And in the process of writing this book,
[00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.900]   well I thought I'd do it when I was retired.
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.700]   I didn't actually, I didn't wait that long
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.820]   because there was a radio discussion
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.580]   between Edward Fredkin and Marvin Minsky.
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.620]   And they were talking about what computers could do,
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.940]   and they were entering a big room,
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.460]   they imagined entering this big room,
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.220]   where at the other end of the room,
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.340]   two computers were talking to each other.
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.660]   And as you walk up to the computers,
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.140]   they will have communicated to each other
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.500]   more ideas, concepts, things,
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.540]   than the entire human race had ever done.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.060]   So I thought, well I know where you're coming from,
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.060]   but I just don't believe you.
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.300]   There's something missing.
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.660]   So I thought, well, I should write my book.
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.060]   And so I did.
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.500]   It was roughly the same time Stephen Hawking
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.100]   was writing his Brief History of Time.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.660]   - In the '80s at some point.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.340]   The book you're talking about is The Emperor's New Mind.
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.420]   - The Emperor's New Mind, that's right.
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.540]   - And both are incredible books,
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.900]   The Brief History of Time and The Emperor's New Mind.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.300]   - Yes, it was quite interesting,
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.860]   'cause he told me he'd got Carl Sagan, I think,
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.380]   to write a forward.
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.220]   - It's a good get.
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.060]   - To the book, you see.
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.580]   So I thought, gosh, what am I gonna do?
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.460]   I'm not gonna get anywhere unless I get somebody.
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.100]   So I said, oh, I know Martin Gardner,
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.780]   so I wonder if he'd do it.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.060]   So he did, and he did a very nice forward.
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.660]   - So that's an incredible book,
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.820]   and some of the same people you mentioned,
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.020]   Ed Franken, which I guess of expert systems fame,
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.380]   and Minsky, of course, people know in the AI world,
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.300]   but they represent the artificial intelligence world.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.220]   - Absolutely, that's right.
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.740]   - That do hope and dream that AI's intelligence is--
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.580]   - That's right.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.400]   Well, you see, it was my thinking,
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.420]   well, you know, I see where they're coming from,
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.260]   and from that perspective--
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.100]   - I disagree.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.020]   - Yeah, you're right, but that's not my perspective.
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.860]   So I thought I had to say it.
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.460]   And as I was writing my book, you see,
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.100]   I thought, well, I don't really know anything
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.580]   about neurophysiology, what am I doing writing this book?
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.540]   So I started reading up about neurophysiology,
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.380]   and I read, and I think, I'm trying to find out
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.860]   how it is that nerve signals could possibly
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.740]   preserve quantum coherence.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.300]   And all I read is that the electrical signals
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.940]   which go along the nerves create effects through the brain,
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.620]   there's no chance you can isolate it.
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.260]   So this is hopeless.
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.060]   So I come to the end of the book,
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.980]   and I more or less give up.
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.580]   I just think of something which I didn't believe in,
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.820]   as maybe this is the way around it, but no.
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.020]   And then you see, I thought, well, maybe this book
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.780]   will at least stimulate young people
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.540]   to do science or something,
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.860]   and I got all these letters from old, retired people instead.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.620]   These are the only people who had time to read my book.
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.540]   - So, I mean--
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.340]   - Except for Stuart Hameroff.
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.820]   - Except for Stuart Hameroff.
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.780]   - Stuart Hameroff wrote to me, and he said,
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.480]   "I think you're missing something.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.820]   "You don't know about microtubules, do you?"
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.240]   He didn't put it quite like that,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.340]   but that was more or less it.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.260]   And he said, "This is what you really need to consider."
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.020]   So I thought, my God, yes,
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.340]   that's a much more promising structure.
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.740]   - So, I mean, fundamentally, you were searching
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.740]   for the source of, non-computable source of consciousness
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.460]   within the human brain, in the biology.
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.460]   And so, what are, if I may ask, what are microtubules?
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.300]   - Well, you see, I was ignorant in what I'd read.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.140]   I never came across them in the books I looked at.
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.300]   Perhaps I only read rather superficially, which is true.
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.540]   But I didn't know about microtubules.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.700]   Stuart, I think one of the things
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.260]   that impressed him about them
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.300]   was when you see pictures of mitosis,
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.740]   that's a cell dividing, and you see all the chromosomes,
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.100]   and the chromosomes, they all get lined up,
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.420]   and then they get pulled apart.
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.060]   And so, as the cell divides, half the chromosomes go,
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.380]   you know, they divide into the two parts,
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.860]   and they go two different ways.
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.260]   And what is it that's pulling them apart?
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.340]   Well, those are these little things called microtubules.
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.020]   And so he started to get interested in them.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.340]   And he formed a view, well, he was,
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.540]   his day job or night job, or whatever you call it,
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.500]   is to put people to sleep,
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.140]   except he doesn't like calling it sleep
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.260]   because it's different,
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.740]   general anesthetics, in a reversible way.
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.460]   So you want to make sure that they don't experience the pain
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.220]   that would otherwise be something that they feel.
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.780]   And consciousness is turned off for a while,
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.340]   and it can be turned back on again.
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.380]   So it's crucial that you can turn it off and turn it on.
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.900]   And what do you do when you're doing that?
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.140]   What do general anesthetic gases do?
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.740]   And see, he formed the view
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.380]   that it's the microtubules that they affect.
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.460]   And the details of why he formed that view is not,
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.780]   well, they're clear to me,
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.100]   but there's an interesting story he keeps talking about.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.940]   But I found this very exciting
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.940]   because I thought these structures,
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.860]   these little tubes which inhabit pretty well all cells,
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.220]   it's not just neurons,
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.020]   apart from red blood cells,
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.380]   they inhabit pretty well all the other cells in the body.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.820]   But they're not all the same kind.
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.460]   You get different kinds of microtubules.
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.180]   And the ones that excited me the most,
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.940]   this may still not be totally clear,
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.620]   but the ones that excited me most
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.740]   were the only ones that I knew about at the time,
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.700]   because they're very, very symmetrical structures.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.060]   And I had reason to believe
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.540]   that these very symmetrical structures
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.580]   would be much better at preserving a quantum state,
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.540]   quantum coherence,
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.180]   preserving the thing without,
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.240]   you just need to preserve certain degrees of freedom
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.540]   without them leaking into the environment.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.860]   Once they leak into the environment, you're lost.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.580]   So you've got to preserve these quantum states at a level
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.860]   which the state reduction process comes in,
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.660]   and that's where I think the non-computability comes in.
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.140]   And it's the measurement process in quantum mechanics,
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.300]   what's going on.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.060]   - So something about the measurement process
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.900]   and what's going on,
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.620]   something about the structure of the microtubules,
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.020]   your intuition says, maybe there's something here.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.980]   Maybe this kind of structure allows
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.980]   for the mystery of the quantum mechanics.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.740]   - There was a much better chance, yes.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.260]   It just struck me that partly it was the symmetry,
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.660]   because there is a feature of symmetry.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.780]   You can preserve quantum coherence
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.660]   much better with symmetrical structures.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.820]   And so there's a good reason for that.
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.020]   And that impressed me a lot.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.180]   I didn't know the difference between the A-lattice
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.440]   and B-lattice at that time, which could be important.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.340]   No, that couldn't, which isn't talked about much.
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.100]   - But that's in some sense details.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.820]   We've got to take a step back just to say,
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.620]   in case people are not familiar.
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.620]   So this was called the orchestrated objective reduction idea
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:59.860]   or ORC-OR, which is a biological philosophy of mind
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.100]   that postulates that consciousness originates
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.740]   at the quantum level inside neurons.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.700]   So that has to do with your search for where,
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.060]   where is it coming from?
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.940]   So that's counter to the notion that consciousness
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.580]   might arise from the computation performed by the synapses.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.940]   - Yes, I think the key point,
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.940]   sometimes people say it's because it's quantum mechanical.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.020]   It's not just that.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.440]   See, it's more outrageous than that.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.700]   You see, this is one reason I think we're so far off from it
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.420]   because we don't even know the physics right.
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.220]   You see, it's not just quantum mechanics.
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.300]   People say, oh, you know,
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.700]   quantum systems and biological structures.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.500]   No, well, you're starting to see
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.500]   that some basic biological systems does depend on quantum.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.940]   I mean, look, in the first place,
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.180]   all of chemistry is quantum mechanics.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.480]   People got used to that, so they don't count that.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.020]   So he said, let's not count quantum chemistry.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.500]   We sort of got the hang of that, I think.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.740]   But you have quantum effects,
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.820]   which are not just chemical, in photosynthesis.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.620]   And this is one of the striking things
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.700]   in the last several years,
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.620]   that photosynthesis seems to be a basically quantum process,
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.260]   which is not simply chemical.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.860]   It's using quantum mechanics in a very basic way.
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.500]   So you could start saying, oh, well,
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.980]   with photosynthesis is based on quantum mechanics,
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.660]   why not behavior of neurons and things like that?
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.140]   Maybe there's something which is a bit like photosynthesis
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.460]   in that respect.
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.520]   But what I'm saying is even more outrageous than that,
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.180]   because those things are talking
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.100]   about conventional quantum mechanics.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.940]   Now, my argument says that conventional quantum mechanics,
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.820]   if you're just following the Schrodinger equation,
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.100]   that's still computable.
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.300]   So you've got to go beyond that.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.300]   So you've got to go to where quantum mechanics goes wrong
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.460]   in a certain sense.
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.180]   You have to be a little bit careful about that,
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.420]   because the way people do quantum mechanics
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.420]   is a sort of mixture of two different processes.
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.860]   One of them is the Schrodinger equation,
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.220]   which is an equation that Schrodinger wrote down,
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.020]   and it tells you how the state of a system evolves.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.180]   And it evolves, according to this equation,
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.740]   completely deterministic,
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.740]   but it evolves into ridiculous situations.
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.100]   And this was what Schrodinger was very much pointing out
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.660]   with his cat.
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.260]   He says, you follow my equation,
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.800]   that's Schrodinger's equation,
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.620]   and you could say that you have to,
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.700]   you have a cat which is dead and alive at the same time.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.580]   That would be the evolution of the Schrodinger equation
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.140]   would lead to a state,
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:54.140]   which is the cat being dead and alive at the same time.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.100]   And he's more or less saying, this is an absurdity.
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.820]   People nowadays say, oh, well, Schrodinger said
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.180]   you can have a cat which is dead and alive.
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.840]   It's not that, you see, he was saying, this is an absurdity.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.180]   There's something missing.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.060]   And that the reduction of the state
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.380]   or the collapse of the wave function or whatever it is,
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.160]   is something which has to be understood.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.220]   It's not following the Schrodinger equation.
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.340]   It's not the way we conventionally do quantum mechanics.
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.020]   There's something more than that.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.640]   And it's easy to quote authority here because Einstein,
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:36.140]   at least three of the greatest physicists of 20th century,
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.180]   who were very fundamental in developing quantum mechanics,
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:45.020]   Einstein, one of them, Schrodinger, another, Dirac, another.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.900]   You have to look carefully at Dirac's writing
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.580]   'cause he didn't tend to say this out loud very much
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.700]   'cause he was very cautious about what he said.
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.900]   You find the right place and you see,
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.020]   he says quantum mechanics is a provisional theory.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:03.060]   We need something which explains
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.900]   the collapse of a wave function.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.620]   We need to go beyond the theory we have now.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.300]   I happen to be one of the kinds of people,
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.260]   there are many, there is a whole group of people,
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.980]   they're all considered to be a bit mavericks,
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.300]   who believe that quantum mechanics needs to be modified.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.580]   There's a small minority of those people,
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.140]   which are already a minority,
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:27.620]   who think that the way in which it's modified
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.940]   has to be with gravity.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.820]   And there is an even smaller minority of those people
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.940]   who think it's the particular way that I think it is.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.020]   So-- - So those are
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.900]   the quantum gravity folks, but what's--
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.100]   - You see, quantum gravity is already not this
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.020]   because when you say quantum gravity,
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.820]   what you really mean is quantum mechanics
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.380]   applied to gravitational theory.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.020]   So you say, let's take this wonderful formalism
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:56.600]   of quantum mechanics and make gravity fit into it.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.440]   So that is what quantum gravity is meant to be.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.860]   Now I'm saying, you've got to be more even handed,
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.540]   that gravity affects the structure
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.820]   of quantum mechanics too.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.220]   It's not just you quantize gravity,
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.820]   you've got to gravitize quantum mechanics.
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.540]   And it's a two-way thing.
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.380]   - But then when do you even get started?
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.700]   So that you're saying that we have to figure out
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.360]   a totally new ideas in that. - Exactly.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.660]   No, you're stuck, you don't have a theory.
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.180]   That's the trouble.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.140]   So this is a big problem, actually,
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.340]   you say, okay, well, what's the theory?
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.660]   I don't know. (laughs)
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.820]   - So maybe in the very early days, sort of--
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.420]   - It is in the very early days,
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.180]   but just making this point. - Yes.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.180]   - You see, Stuart Hameroff tends to be,
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.540]   oh, Penrose says that it's got to be
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.980]   a reduction of the state and so on, so let's use it.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.500]   The trouble is Penrose doesn't say that.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.300]   Penrose says, well, I think that.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.860]   (laughs)
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.460]   We have no experiments as yet, which shows that.
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.940]   There are experiments which are being thought through
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.100]   and which I'm hoping will be performed.
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.700]   There is an experiment which is being developed
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.420]   by Dirk Baumeister, who I've known for a long time,
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.700]   who shares his time between Leiden in the Netherlands
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.260]   and Santa Barbara in the US.
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.100]   And he's been working on an experiment
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:16.100]   which could perhaps demonstrate that quantum mechanics,
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.020]   as we now understand it,
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.420]   if you don't bring in the gravitational effects,
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.120]   has to be modified.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.380]   - And then there's also experiments that are underway
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:32.020]   that kind of look at the microtubule side of things
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.980]   to see if there's, in the biology,
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.220]   you could see something like that.
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.420]   Could you briefly mention it?
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.460]   Because that's a really sort of
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.100]   one of the only experimental attempts
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.140]   in the very early days of even thinking about consciousness.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.820]   - I think there's a very serious area here,
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.700]   which is what Stuart Hemoroff is doing,
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.420]   and I think it's very important.
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.140]   One of the few places that you can really get
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.180]   a bit of a handle on what consciousness is
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.440]   is what turns it off.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.420]   And when you're thinking about general anesthetics,
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.060]   it's very specific.
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.620]   These things turn consciousness off.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.700]   What the hell do they do?
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.300]   Well, Stuart and a number of people who work with him
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.820]   and others happen to believe that the general anesthetics
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.140]   directly affect microtubules.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.060]   And there is some evidence for this.
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.580]   I don't know how strong it is
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.180]   and how watertight the case is,
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.780]   but I think there is some evidence
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.540]   pointing in that kind of direction.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.580]   It's not just an ordinary chemical process.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.900]   There's something quite different about it.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.820]   And one of the main candidates is that
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:43.040]   the anesthetic gases do affect directly microtubules.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.860]   And how strong that evidence is,
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.500]   I wouldn't be in a position to say,
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.260]   but I think there is fairly impressive evidence.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.100]   - And the point is the experiments are being undertaken,
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:54.940]   which is-- - Yes.
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.100]   I mean, that is experimental.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.660]   You see, so it's a very clear direction
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.300]   where you can think of experiments which could indicate
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.500]   whether or not it's really microtubules,
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.500]   which the anesthetic gases directly affect.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.700]   - That's really exciting.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.780]   One of the sad things is, as far as I'm,
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.180]   from my outside perspective,
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.820]   is not many people are working on this.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.660]   So there's a very, like with Stuart,
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.340]   it feels like there's very few people
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.660]   are carrying the flag forward on this.
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.260]   - I think it's not many in the sense it's a minority,
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.820]   but it's not zero anymore.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.500]   You see, when Stuart and I were originally taught by this--
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.340]   - It was zero.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.260]   - We were just us and a few of our friends,
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.620]   there weren't many people taking it,
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.620]   but it's grown into one of the main viewpoints.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.660]   There might be about four or five or six different views
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:49.060]   that people hold, and it's one of them.
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.460]   So it's considered as one of the possible
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.780]   lines of thinking, yes.
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.500]   - You describe physics theories
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.340]   as falling into one of three categories,
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.260]   the superb, the useful, or the tentative.
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.100]   I like those words.
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.980]   It's a beautiful categorization.
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.380]   Do you think we'll ever have a superb theory
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.180]   of intelligence and of consciousness?
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.020]   - We might.
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.100]   We're a long way from it.
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.420]   I don't think we're even,
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.300]   whether we're in the tentative scale.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.260]   I mean, it's--
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.660]   - You don't think we've even entered
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.860]   the realm of tentative?
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:24.700]   - Probably not, I think it's--
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.940]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.540]   - No, when you see this, it's so controversial.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.580]   We don't have a clear view,
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.500]   which is accepted by a majority.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.740]   I mean, you say, yeah, people,
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.700]   most views are computational in one form or another.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.660]   I think it's some, but it's not very clear,
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:45.660]   'cause even the IIT people who think of them
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.300]   as computational, but I've heard them say,
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.420]   "No, consciousness is supposed to be not computational."
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.340]   I say, "Well, if it's not computational,
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.460]   "what in the hell is it?
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.460]   "What's going on?
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.620]   "What physical processes are going on which are that?"
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.100]   - What does it mean for something to be computational then?
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.180]   So, is--
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.980]   - Well, there has to be a process which is,
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.220]   you see, it's very curious the way the history
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.540]   has developed in quantum mechanics,
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.460]   because very early on, people thought
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.180]   there was something to do with consciousness,
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.380]   but it was almost the other way around.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.380]   You see, you have to say the Schrodinger equations
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.420]   says all these different alternatives happen all at once,
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.940]   and then when is it that only one of them happens?
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.220]   Well, one of the views, which was quite commonly held
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.860]   by a few distinguished quantum physicists,
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.020]   that's when a conscious being looks at the system
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.700]   or becomes aware of it, and at that point,
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.100]   it becomes one or the other.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.100]   That's a role where consciousness
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.420]   is somehow actively reducing the state.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.500]   My view is almost the exact opposite of that.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.540]   It's the state reduces itself in some way which,
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.500]   some non-computational way which we don't understand,
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.580]   we don't have a proper theory of,
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:05.580]   and that is the building block of what consciousness is.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.620]   So consciousness, it's the other way around.
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:12.620]   It depends on that choice which nature makes all the time
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.500]   when the state becomes one or the other,
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.420]   rather than the superposition of one and the other,
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.940]   and when that happens, there is what we're saying now,
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.480]   an element of proto-consciousness takes place.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.980]   Proto-consciousness is, roughly speaking,
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.760]   the building block out of which
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.420]   actual consciousness is constructed.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.540]   So you have these proto-conscious elements
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.380]   which are when the state decides
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.900]   to do one thing or the other,
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.900]   and that's the thing which, when organized together,
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.780]   that's the OR part in OrcOR, but the Orc part,
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.940]   that's the, the OR part, at least one can see
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.620]   where we're driving at a theory.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.500]   You can say it's the quantum choice
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.060]   of going this way or that way,
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.060]   but the Orc part, which is the orchestration of this,
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.940]   is much more mysterious,
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.620]   and how does the brain somehow orchestrate
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.940]   all these individual OR processes
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.940]   into a genuine conscious experience?
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.460]   - And it might be something that's beautifully simple,
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.140]   but we're completely in the dark about.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.580]   - Yeah, I think at the moment, that's the thing.
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.300]   You know, we happily put the word Orc down there
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.860]   to say orchestrated, but that's even more unclear
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.420]   what that really means.
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:35.420]   - Just like the word material, orchestrated, who knows?
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.580]   And we've been dancing a little bit
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.140]   between the word intelligence
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.340]   or understanding and consciousness.
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.420]   Do you kind of see those as sitting
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.180]   in the same space of mystery as we've been discussing?
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.180]   - Yes, but you see, I tend to say
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:54.180]   you have understanding and intelligence and awareness.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:21:00.020]   And somehow, understanding is in the middle of it.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:05.540]   You see, I like to say, could you say of an entity
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.220]   that is actually intelligent
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.740]   if it doesn't have the quality of understanding?
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:15.100]   Maybe I'm using terms I don't even know how to define,
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:15.940]   but who cares?
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:16.780]   I'm just relating them.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.860]   - They're somewhat poetic, so if I somehow understand them.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.260]   - Yes, that's right, we don't, exactly.
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.660]   - But they're not mathematical in nature.
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.460]   - Yes, you see, as a mathematician,
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.780]   I don't know how to define any of them,
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.820]   but at least I can point to the connections.
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.620]   So the idea is intelligence is something
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.340]   which I believe needs understanding.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.780]   Otherwise, you wouldn't say it's really intelligence.
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.820]   And understanding needs awareness.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.380]   Otherwise, you wouldn't really say it's understanding.
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.220]   Do you say of an entity that understands something,
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.820]   unless it's really aware of it, in our normal usage.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.180]   So there's a three sort of awareness, understanding,
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.220]   and intelligence.
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.940]   And I just tend to concentrate on understanding
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.180]   because that's where I can say something.
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.380]   And that's the Godel theorem, things like that.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.860]   But what does it mean to perceive the color blue
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.900]   or something, I mean, foggiest?
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.460]   That's a much more difficult question.
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.460]   I mean, is it the same if I see a color blue and you see it?
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.980]   If you're something with, what, this condition,
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.700]   what is it called?
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.940]   - Oh, where you assign a sound to a color?
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:23.780]   - Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.100]   You get colors and sounds mixed up.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.220]   And that sort of thing.
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.140]   I mean, an interesting subject.
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.220]   - But from the physics perspective,
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.580]   from the fundamentals perspective, we don't.
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.660]   - I think we're way off having much understanding
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.780]   what's going on there.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.300]   (whooshing)
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.620]   (whooshing)
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.940]   (whooshing)
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.260]   (whooshing)
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.580]   (whooshing)
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.900]   (whooshing)
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.220]   (whooshing)
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:05.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
