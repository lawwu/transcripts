[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in the book of the Acts of the Apostles in chapter 5, reading from verse 29 to verse 32.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, "We ought to obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   And we are his witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him."
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   I want in particular to deal this evening with the first part of the 31st verse. "Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince, a prince and a Savior."
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Now these words, as we've already been seeing on a number of Sunday evenings, were the words that were spoken by the apostles to the great court at Jerusalem, the Sanhedrin, who had put the apostles on trial.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   They were on trial, you remember, because they were preaching the gospel, and because they were working miracles in the name of Christ. They had created a disturbance.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   The crowds were following them and were attending to their sermons and addresses and to their works, and this had aroused the fury of the authorities in Jerusalem.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   So they'd arrested the apostles and had thrown them into prison, but they'd been delivered miraculously and had gone back to preach in the temple as they were told to do.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   So they were arrested once more, and here they are before the council, and this is the charge brought against them.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   "Did not we straightly commend you that you should not teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us."
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Now, you see, the position in which the apostles found themselves was just that. Here they are confronted by the earthly, human, worldly authority and power.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   This authority and power is trying to prohibit the preaching of the Christian message.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And this is what the apostles say in reply. They say, "We cannot promise to stop doing this. We must go on preaching this message. We ought to obey God rather than men."
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Why? Well, the answer is because of what God has done. And what God has done is to raise up this Jesus and to appoint him as prince and savior.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So what we've got here, in a sense, is a picture, you see, of two different types of government. Two whole ideas of government of mankind and of the world.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   The human, the divine, and the eternal.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Now, we've been looking at this great message here, and we've seen that in this extraordinary manner the apostles are able to give this wonderful summary of the gospel and of its purpose in this world.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And we've been concentrating so far on the personal aspect, Christ as the savior, as the one who delivers us from our individual predicaments.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   It is always right, as I'm going to show you, that we should start with that. But it is very wrong indeed to stop with that and to think that that is the whole of the gospel.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   It isn't, and we are reminded here that this is not the whole of the gospel. Christ is not only the savior. He is a prince, a governor, a ruler.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And in this very wonderful way we are given this contrast, this picture. Here's a little summary of the whole of human history, as I'm going to show you.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Human governors, the prince, the governor of the universe.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Now, it's a very great mistake, I say, to think that the gospel has only got a personal message.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   There are many people who think that. There are many people out in the world tonight who are not Christians, because they take that view of the gospel and of the Christian message.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   They say there are many people in trouble. They say we're all in a sense in trouble. And there are some people who seem to be helped by Christianity.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   It gives them comfort, gives them a little bit of happiness, gives them fellowship.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Well, they say it's all right. If they do get help from that sort of thing, let them have it. They're welcome to it.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   But they say, of course, it's got nothing to do with us. We get our relief and our help and our happiness in other ways.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   So they're not interested in Christianity. Their view is that we are all born with a certain type of temperament.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   We belong to different psychological types. And there is the religious type. And they say that's all right. There's no quarrel with that.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Let the religious type get its comfort and its help from religion. But we don't belong to that type.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And therefore, the gospel, they say, has got nothing at all to do with us.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   You see, they dismiss it because they regard it as just something which is purely personal and has got nothing to say to them and to the great world at large.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   They think it is some sort of survival still in a certain little group of people, some 10% only of this country.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I use the figures because we're living in times of statistics and polls and so on.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And we, here it is, 10% only, are interested in Christianity. And it will soon, of course, get smaller and smaller as mankind grows up and becomes more educated.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And in the end, of course, it will vanish and disappear altogether.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   All right. It's all right as long as it helps certain people. Nothing to say to us and to the world in general.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Now, unfortunately, there are certain Christian people who lend a good deal of color to that and very wrongly.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Let's be honest and frank and admit this.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   There are Christian people who themselves also seem to confine the Christian message to a personal matter of salvation.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   They're interested because of what it does for them.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And they're always looking at themselves and their own experiences and they want this and that.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And their whole notion of the Christian faith is that it's just and solely a matter of personal salvation.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Jesus Christ, the Savior.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Now, I say, He is that. Thank God He is that.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   It is our first need, every one of us.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   But, my dear Christian friend, if you are going to confine it to that, well, you're not only encouraging the other people to go wrong in their thinking,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   you are putting a very sad and grievous limit upon the glory of this great gospel.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   This is a gospel for the universe.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It starts with personal salvation, but it doesn't end with it.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   It is a proclamation that God has exalted His Son by His right hand to be a prince.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   The gospel is concerned about the whole world, whether men realize that or whether they do not realize that.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   The gospel not only delivers us from this present evil world as individuals,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   this gospel is eventually going to deliver the whole universe from all the ravages and the consequences of sin.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Has the gospel anything to say on this particular Sunday night, therefore?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Pre-election Sunday night.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   This gospel, anything to say about it?
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   This gospel in irrelevance to the conditions in this country at this very moment?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I'm trying to show you what it is.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It has a very relevant message indeed,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   and a message that is needed by this country more than all the messages that are being delivered to it at this present time.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I want to try to show you that.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Christ is the prince as well as the Savior, prince of the world and of the universe.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Now, there are many ways in which the Bible itself states this great message.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   There is none perhaps that is more perfect in that respect than a statement made by the apostle Paul
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   in the first chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians in verse 10.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   He says, "This is the will of God. He has made known unto us the mystery of his will,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself."
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   This is God's purpose.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   "That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one, in Christ, all things,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   both which are in him and which are on earth, even in him."
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Now that is God's great purpose in Christ with respect to this universe.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   This is an essential part of the preaching of the gospel.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   That's exactly what the apostles meant on this occasion.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   They turned to these earthly rulers and they said, "You're trying to stop us from preaching this gospel.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   You think that you're exercising your rights and that you're doing what you should be doing as governors
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   who are here to maintain law and order, and you're telling us not to preach about this person."
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   They said, "You're not only ignorant as to who he is, but you're ignorant as to what he's come to do in this world.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   He is the governor.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   He is the only one who can govern.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   We can't keep silent about him.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   He is the ruler of the universe.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   He is the only one who can do successfully what you are trying to do and what you are failing to do."
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Him hath God exalted by his right hand to be a prince as well as a savior.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   But as you see, the earthly powers oppose this.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   They don't like this.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And they've continued to be like this throughout the running centuries.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Now, my friends, I want to try to show you this.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   It's all here in this picture.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Here's the great problem of today.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Here's the whole problem of man and life in this world.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   The two powers.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   The two attempts at governing man in this world.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Now, there's only one way whereby we really can grasp this message.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   And that is that we've got to take a kind of bird's eye view of the teaching of the whole of the Bible.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Now, here's a convenient opportunity for doing that.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Our text makes us do it.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   It says that he's a prince.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   But I want to show you that in terms of tonight.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   General election.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Why?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Well, you must have government, you say.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   But why must you have government?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Here, these are the questions that are raised.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Now, my argument is that you can't understand the history of the human race, the past, the present, nor the future,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   except in the light of the teaching of this book which we call the Bible.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   But you've got to take it as a whole.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   It's no use just coming and saying, "Christ will do this, that, or the other for me."
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   He will.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   But, oh, my dear friend, let him speak for himself.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Look at him in the glory and the greatness of his power, this blessed prince.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And here it is in the whole of the Bible.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   "The God of our fathers," say these apostles, "the God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus."
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   In other words, they are correcting immediately the thinking of the authorities.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   They say, "You know, you were looking at Jesus, that man who walked about this city and other places, and who did what he did,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   and you were just starting with him as it were, as he appeared before you, and as you crucified him, and as he was dead and buried."
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   But they say, "Your views are too short, they're too small. You haven't got the context.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   God of our fathers."
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   If you want to understand him, go back into history.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   And you know, that's the trouble with so many today.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Their views are too foreshortened.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Everything's oversimplified.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   You know, we are dealing with great problems, my friends.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   The problems of the world are profound.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   They're tremendous problems.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And there's only one way to understand them.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   You've got to have this great context.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   And that's where what we are hearing so much at this present time, oh, is so small and seems so trivial.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   It's not surprising the country and the world are in a muddle.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   You see, they haven't got the context.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   They don't know how to take their problems and put them into the setting of eternity.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And that's why they always fail.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Let me show you this.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Now, I can summarize the message of the Bible for you, if you like, in these terms.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   This is what the Bible has got to say to tonight, and to tomorrow, and every day until Thursday, and after that, and always.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   You must go back, you see, to the beginning, to creation.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   You've got to start with the world itself, what it is, where it's come from.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   You've got to start with man, the origin of man.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   You see, it's no use trying to decide what you're going to do for man until you know what man is.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   And that's where all these politicians put them together in all the parties.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   They're so insulting to us.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   They think we can be bought with sixpences, or with more bread or butter, and food and things like that.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   It's an insult to human nature.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   The problem of man is not just a problem of that character and at that level.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Man is a being.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   They never consider that.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   They never stop to think about it.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   And they're competing in an attempt to bribe us and to please us.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   It's an insult to us.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   You've got to go back, and you've got to consider, I say again, what the whole universe is, and what man is, and where he's come from.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And then you go on to face this question.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   I ask again, why do you need government?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Why do you need magistrates?
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Why do you need SOGs?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Why do you need sanctions?
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Why do you need authority?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Why do you need punishment?
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Why do you need prisons?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And all these things.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Here are the questions that the Bible alone deals with.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   All these other people, they'll argue as to whether you should give new beds to the prisoners in prison, and give them psychotherapy and so on.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   But you see, they never face the question of why is there ever a need for prisons at all.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Why are there any troubles in the world?
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   And there is only one answer to that.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   It's the answer that is provided here.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   It is that men must fall.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   It is that men who have been made perfect in the image of God, rebelled against God,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   and thereby brought down chaos and punishment upon himself.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   It is men who have brought trouble and confusion into the world.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   So you start, you see, and the Bible starts.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   It doesn't spend much time in giving us all the details about creation, but it has to give us the background and the setting.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   It's all from God.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   There are the first two chapters of Genesis.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   But what it's really interested in is this, the state and condition of the world as it is now.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   That's due to what you get in chapter three of Genesis, the fall of men.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Trouble, confusion, men earning his bread by the sweat of his brow.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Trouble and confusion, and it goes on increasing.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Indeed, at the very beginning of Genesis, you begin to read accounts of the state and the condition of this world at this moment.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   It all began there.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Now then, here's the vital thing for us this evening in particular.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   From there on, you are confronted by two great lines, or if you prefer it, by two types of history.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   There is what you may call man's history.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   There is God's history.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Now, here's the way to understand life and all its attendant circumstances and problems.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   There are two types of history, and you and I are involved in two types of history, whether we know it or not.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   The business of preaching is to make us aware of that, to give us instruction about that.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Now, everybody's aware, of course, of man's history.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   And this is the real tragedy and the essence of the tragedy of the world, that it only knows about man's history, the history that man makes.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   General election, possibility of change of government, man's history, governments deciding to declare war, fighting it, man's history.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   And you read your secular history books, it's men, great men, small men, man making history.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   And the tragedy of the world is that it thinks that that is the only type and kind of history.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   It's completely blind to the other history, to God's history, to what God is producing and bringing into being and bringing to pass.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   This amazing history that the world is ignorant of.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   The world is reading its Sunday newspapers, and it thinks it knows and understands.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   It doesn't know anything about the real history, which is God's history.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Now, this, I say, is so typical of the world, and it is of the very essence of the tragedy of the world.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Let me give you just one of the most notable example of all, of just this thing that I'm putting before you.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   You remember the accounts that we are given of the birth of our Lord and Savior.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I'm thinking particularly at the moment of the account we are given of that in the second chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   You remember the story, don't you?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Surely even in these days everybody remembers the story of how the whole world was being taxed.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   It came to pass in those days that they went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   This taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria, and all went to be taxed, everyone into his own city.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   That's men's history. That's the thing that men is interested in.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   And we are told that Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   and to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   A taxing, a notable occasion, something like a general election, it hadn't the same object and purpose,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   but everybody was involved and everybody had to go and register and do this thing.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   He went to be taxed with Mary, his espoused wife, who was being great with child.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   And do you remember what happened?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Mary was on the verge of giving birth to her child, but all the rooms were booked, the inns were full.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   There was no room for them in the inn.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   So she and Joseph had to go to a stable, and it was in the stable that the child was born.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   You can see what was happening, can't you?
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Have a look at the inns of Bethlehem. Can't you see them all crowded? The bars particularly.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Everybody drinking. What were they talking about? Politics. Taxing. Taxes had been put up.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Was it right? Was it wrong? Shouldn't they make a protest? Shouldn't they do something?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   This was the thing, this taxing that was first started in the time when Sirenius was in control.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   And they were arguing on this political... This was the big thing.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   This was the thing that everybody should be interested in and concerned about.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   This was the thing that was given the publicity of that time. This was the big event.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   The fact that a child is born in a stable and a little body placed in a manger, well,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   too trivial to pay any attention to it, I think, is almost nonsensical.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Can't you see it all there in a picture? You see, that's God's history.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   That's the thing that's turned the world upside down. That's the thing that makes us call this 1966.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   The thing that seemed unimportant, insignificant. The thing that didn't matter.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   The other thing was the big thing. Man's history. What man does and what God does is ignored and forgotten.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   He sees anything in it. Yet that, you see, is the thing that really matters.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Now, this is the explanation of the whole course of human history.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   And this is the message of the gospel to us and to our world this evening.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   I must hold these two things before you.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   There's the Sanhedrin, the worldly authority, the worldly government.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   And it says to the preacher of the gospel, "Stop doing that. Don't mention this name.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   We don't want to hear anything about it. It's creating a disturbance.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   It isn't helping law and order. It's irrelevant, but it's a nuisance at the same time.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   You must stop it. We straightly charge you not to preach or teach any more in the name of this man."
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   And there's only one answer to be given to that, the answer of the apostles.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   And I'm privileged to repeat it tonight.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   We are to obey God rather than men. Why?
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Well, we are preaching about the one who is the Prince of the Universe.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   The only one who can govern, who has a right to govern, the only one who is going to govern.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   But now you see there's a conflict. The world doesn't accept this.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   The world has to be convinced about this and convicted about this.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   So let's proceed to do so.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Let's have a look at this human history, this man's history, this history that is made chiefly by men.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   What do we say about this history?
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Well, the first thing we've got to say even about this is that it's God who brought it into being.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   You see, here's the problem. Men has rebelled and has fallen. The world is in trouble.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   What can be done about this?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Well, God in his infinite wisdom and through what is called his common grace,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   he decided and determined to produce a certain order
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   which was to be arranged and kept going by men.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   What is this? Well, this is human government, if you like.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Now, there are many statements about this in the scriptures.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   We are told, for instance, in Paul's address to the Stoics and Epicureans at Athens, as recorded in Acts 17,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   that God has ordered the bounds of the habitation of all the nations of the earth.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   God has divided up the world into nations and has arranged these things,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   but over and above that, as Romans 13 taught us at the beginning,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   the powers that be are ordained of God.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   It is God who ordained government. Why?
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Well, in order to keep the effects of sin within bounds and in order.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   So God ordained that there should be governors, magistrates, kings, princes, and those who control these matters.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   God has brought all this into being.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   And he has then, as it were, handed it over to men.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   The object of all this is to control.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   In addition, he has given gifts to men, given abilities, given intellects,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   given power of government, political understanding, and all these things.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Now, there is the beginning of this order that we are all so familiar with,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   man's history, man's government.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   What are the characteristics of this?
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   That's the thing we need to ask at a time like this.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   What are the characteristics of this?
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   And it's quite clear in the Bible and in subsequent history,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   this very order of government that has been ordained by God for our good has been abused by men.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   For men claim that it's his and his alone.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   He rejects God. He takes the power into his own hands.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   He spurns the vice divine. He needs no help from God.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   He thinks he is able to order his own affairs.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   I am the master of my fate, he says. I am the captain of my soul.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   And what has he done?
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Well, what he's done, of course, is to attempt to produce what is called civilization.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Man has done this from the beginning.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   He has tried to produce order and system.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   He's tried to produce a state of comfort.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   He has tried it by means of farming and of trading.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   He's tried it by building cities and introducing community life.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   He's done it by means of culture, interested in art and in music and in literature.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   All these things are but a part of men's attempt to deal with his own predicament and situation,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   to improve his lot, to give himself peace and rest and quiet and contentment.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   And above all, of course, politics.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   This is the way in which men tries to reduce the chaos into order and to produce a certain system.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Now, in doing all this, of course, he's divided up.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   You've had your rival schools in art and literature and music and in politics.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   You've got your rival parties.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   But, of course, they're all rarely out to do exactly the same thing.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   There's no difference. It's only a difference of method.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   They're all offering us the same bribes.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   They all say they're interested in our good.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   So that in spite of all their differences and distinctions,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   they're rarely all out to produce this kind of civilized order and living.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   But what happens? What does it lead to?
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Well, you see, the world is a very old place, and we know something of what has been happening.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   What we find is this, that in spite of all the efforts and the endeavors of men to produce civilization,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   the jungle is always encroaching.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Men have tried to make order out of the jungle and to cultivate the jungle,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   and he works hard and he sweats and he travels, but the jungle is always tending to encroach.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   There are always setbacks.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Lawlessness always seems to be there.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Strife is always ready to insinuate itself.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   There have been wars and suffering and theft and robbery and moral muddle and unhappiness.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   You've needed a police system.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   There's been the threat of dictatorships.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   This is a summary of human history for you.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Men setting out to produce civilization, order, peace, plenty, contentment.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   But there's always this trouble and this strife and this discord, and there's always this threatening.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   That has always been the long story of the human race.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   So that looking back across it all, what you see is this, isn't it?
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   That man's history is but a sort of perpetual cycle that you go round and round.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Certain periods when things seem to be improving and getting better,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   that was more or less true in the Victorian era,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   and they thought they were on the verge of perfection and of the millennium and of the golden age.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   But they always find that when you get to the top of the cycle,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   you begin to go down the other side, periods of retrogression.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   The whole history of this man's endeavor to govern and to bring order can be summed up like this.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Rise, decline, fall.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Now it's the most amazing thing, how in the history of the great empires of the past,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   you get this very thing. It's very fascinating to read about it.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   How it starts in practically nothing, able men and they're diligent and they work,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   and they rise and they get to the top, then decline and fall.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   You get into perfection in the Roman Empire, it's true of all the others.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   That is the story of the human race.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   This is man attempting to make his history and to control the world and to bring order out of the chaos.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   But there at the back of it all is God.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   And as the Bible makes so plain and clear, God is allowing it and he's controlling it.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   If a dictatorship arises and seems to threaten the whole world, God strikes.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   The Bible, the Old Testament in particular, is full of great illustrations of this.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Yernebukadnezzar and others who exalt themselves to the heavens, smitten, struck,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   made fools of before their own populace, down they're brought by God.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   God allows it and yet he controls it. He never allows it to advance beyond a certain limit.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   But my dear friends, isn't it about time we ask this question?
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   What's the explanation of all this? Why should it be like this?
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Why is the world still in trouble in this mid-20th century?
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   With all our efforts and endeavors and all our great advances, what's the matter?
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   And you see there's only one answer to this.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   It is due to the fact that man has got a sinful nature and a fallen nature.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   It's due to man's whole estrangement from God.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   And more, it's due to God's wrath upon men in his sinfulness and his arrogance and his pride.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   But you see the tragedy of the world is that it doesn't realize this.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   And that is why it always fails.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   The world is always trying to improve itself but it can't do so.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   It's always falling back again.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   It's advance and retrogression, rise, fullness, decline, fall.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   And it goes on and on and on repeating it.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Man's attempt to govern the world is nothing but a disaster and a failure.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   And it is still the same tonight.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   I was only reading again the other day and it came to me very forcibly.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   The explanation given by that great historian Gibbon of the causes of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Listen to this.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   This is what Gibbon, who wasn't a Christian, this is what he gives us as the explanation of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   And if this isn't true of this country tonight, well then I am completely ignorant.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Here are the five reasons.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   One, the rapid increase of divorce.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   The undermining of the dignity and sanctity of the home which is the basis of human society.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Now that's not being said by me, a little evangelical preacher.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   That's the great Edward Gibbon.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   And of course he's right.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Once the home goes, which is the fundamental unit in society, everything will sooner or later go.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   That's his first reason. The second, higher and higher taxes.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   And the spending of public monies for bread and circuses.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   This is Edward Gibbon.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Higher and higher taxes and the spending of public money for bread and circuses.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Third, the mad craze for pleasure and sport, sport becoming every year more and more exciting and more brutal.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   This is Edward Gibbon of the early centuries A.D.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   The next thing, number four, is the building of gigantic armaments.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   When the real enemy is within in the decadence of the people themselves.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   And lastly, the decay of religious faith.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Faith fading into mere form, which has lost all contact with reality.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Now there you see, according to Edward Gibbon, are the five main causes of the decline and fall of the great Roman Empire.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   And you see it is still the same.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   That was a wonderful civilization that those men were the greatest experts perhaps the world has ever known on local government and on legal systems.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   The Roman system that was real civilization.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Coupled with it, the Greek civilization that had gone just before it.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   And you had the human endeavor almost at its acme.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   But what happened to it?
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   It was conquered by the barbarians.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   The Goths and the Vandals.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   The ignoramuses.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   How did the Goths and the Vandals, the barbarians ever conquer this great civilization?
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   And the answer you see is given by Gibbon, it was in turn a rot in the civilization.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And that is an epitome of the whole of men's history.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   All his systems fail, he's always failing.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   Why?
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Well because the trouble is within men.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And external rules and laws and regulations cannot change him.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   The trouble isn't that we need better laws, we need better natures.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   It isn't better instruction, it is better spirits and better desires.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And so all this history which is produced by men comes to nothing.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   And yet this power prohibits the preaching of the gospel.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   The only thing that can save the situation.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   But thank God in spite of its prohibitions, the message goes on.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   God's purpose goes on.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   We are to obey God rather than men.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom he who slew and hanged on a tree.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   You've always done that and you've been doing it throughout the centuries.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   You've done it to this one.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   God raised him, exalted him and has set him at his right hand to be a prince and a savior.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   For to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   This is the message and this is why we cannot be silent.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   We have the message which holds out the only hope for the world tonight.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   And it is that this Christ is prince.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   This is the whole message and story of the Bible.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   What is the problem? I must remind you again.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   The need of mankind tonight is not for better laws, not better conditions.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   It's for a new outlook, a new mind, a new heart.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Man is fighting the devil and fighting evil that's outside him and inside him.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   And that is why I say he fails.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   But here is the message, thank God for it.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   It's not left to men.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   There's another history, there's another purpose, there's another plan.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   It is God's, the God of our fathers.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   What's he mean?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Well, here it is I say.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   Let me give you a summary of the whole of this great message in the scripture.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Man fell and brought down the trouble upon himself.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   And God in his infinite kindness and mercy and compassion came down and addressed him in the garden,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   called him out from behind the tree where he was hiding himself in shame and spoke to him.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   And he told him about the punishment that he'd brought down upon himself.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   And then he gave him a promise.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   He said, "I'm going to do something about this.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   God has made a promise."
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Now, the whole history of the Old Testament, in between, over and above, round about this human history that is also recorded here,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   is God's history.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   What God is bringing to pass.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Where do you see it?
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Well, you see it in Abel as over against Cain.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   You see it in Noah as against the rest of the world.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   This is God.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   God producing his men, his people, raising up a man called Abram, turning him into a nation,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   giving him a son called Isaac in his old age.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Then he has a son called Jacob.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   And out of these men comes a race, a nation, a people, the children of Israel, the people of God.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Now, here is the thing.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   God is introducing his own kingdom into the midst of the kingdoms of men and the kingdoms of the world.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   And this is how he does it.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   God makes a nation for himself.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   And he says, "Through this nation I'm going to speak to the others."
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   So he deals with this nation in a very special manner.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   He gives them revelations of himself.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   He gives them truth concerning men and his nature and being and purpose in this world, which nobody else ever had.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   He gives them laws by which to live and to order their conduct and their affairs, ten commandments and others.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   He shows them the way to be blessed and to enjoy a life of righteousness and of peace.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   The Apostle Paul sums that all up by talking in this way.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   In the third chapter of the epistle to the Romans he says that one of the greatest gifts that God ever gave to us as Jews is the oracles of God.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   This mighty revelation of God and men in his relationship to God and God's purpose.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   And you see it all comes to this.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   God carried this on throughout the running centuries.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   He did so in spite of the failure, the repeated failure and recalcitrance and unutterable folly of these, his own people even.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   God still went on and he kept them going with this great promise.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   The thing made originally in the garden of Eden, the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   And they all look forward. It's bad at the time, they don't know what to do.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   But there's a hope, they look forward, there's someone coming.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   And all the great prophets, they all repeat this message, "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith your God."
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   There is one going to come who will be the prince.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   And this is the one who is going to achieve this great and desired object.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   Here it is in most wonderful words as written by the prophet Isaiah,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government, the government shall be upon his shoulder.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   And his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   And of the increase of his government and peace, there shall be no end upon the throne of David,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth and forever."
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Now there you see is this great and tremendous promise, which runs through the whole of your Old Testament.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   And then there are periods, centuries pass, 400 years when there seems to be no word from God after the writing of the prophet Malachi,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   and then suddenly an extraordinary thing takes place.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   There was a maiden, a virgin, whose name was Mary.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   One afternoon, quite thoughtless, she suddenly finds herself visited by an archangel.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Notice the way in which the Bible introduces its history.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee named Nazareth,
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   to a virgin, espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   And the angel came to her and said, "Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Blessed art thou amongst women."
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   An unknown woman, just an ordinary virgin, not a great governor, not a great king, not some great human notability,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   but some unknown maiden, no one ever thought anything about.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   It's to her, you see this is God's history, it's the reversal of men's always.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   God ridicules human greatness.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   He takes the nobodies and exalts them and makes them everything.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   He came and he said to her, she was troubled at his saying,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   and cast in her mind what manner of salutation there should be,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   and the angel said unto her, "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name Jesus.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end."
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   And he was born.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   He came.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Here he is, this little babe put in the manger.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   But the wise men come from the east and they worship him and they bring their incense and their adoration.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   Who is he? This is the Prince of Peace.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   This is the Governor promised.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   This is the one on whose shoulder the government shall be placed.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   What has he come to do?
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   Well now, let's be clear about this.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   This is where so much goes wrong at the present time.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   He has not come to reform the world.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   He has not come to teach it how to reform itself.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   And of all the men in this country tonight who are denying the gospel,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   they are the greatest deniers who turn this gospel into a political message of human reform.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   And who are trying to persuade men and women to practice the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   That is the greatest denial of all.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   I infinitely prefer the publican and the sinner, the harlot and the drunkard and the murderer and the thief.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   He has not come to reform the world.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   What has he come to do?
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   He has come to set up his kingdom.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   Which is a very different thing.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   Follow his teaching and you'll find that it's always about the kingdom.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   He says the time is fulfilled.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   The kingdom of God is at hand.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   Repenting and believe the gospel.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   What is this kingdom? What's he doing?
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Well, here is what we are told about it in this book.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   This is how he does it.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   He doesn't lay down a program and say, "Well now, commend that to the people.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   Tell them to put that into practice.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Your pacifisms and so on."
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   It isn't that at all, but it's this.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   He first of all preaches a message of individual and personal salvation.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Some people one day took hold of him and they tried to take him by force to make him a king in Jerusalem.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   That was their idea, you see, of his purpose in this world.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   They could see that he was unusual, that he'd got exceptional abilities and understanding and power.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   So they tried to take him by force and take him to Jerusalem to make him a king.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   He gets away from them and goes up to a mountain himself alone.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   He would not have that. He hadn't come to do that.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   What did he come? He had come to seek and to save that which was lost.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   He had come first and foremost to give us individual salvation.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   He had come to reconcile us one by one to God.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   He starts with individuals.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   He doesn't start with a great political or world program.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   He starts with individuals, unknown individuals generally.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Look at his first followers, fishermen, ordinary illiterate common people,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   who couldn't understand political theory and philosophy.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   He deals with them. He deals with them as souls.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   He deals with them as sinners and he teaches them how he has come to save them.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   He tells them he has come to reconcile them to God.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   The son of men, he says, has not come to be ministered unto but a minister
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   and to give his life a ransom for many.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   He washes their feet.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   He says that he alone can save them by dying for them.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   He's got to be lifted up on a cross and die and thereby he's going to save them.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   He's going to reconcile them to God by bearing the punishment of their sins in his own body.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   And then having reconciled them to God, he separates them from the world.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   He gives them a new birth, a new nature.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   You see how different it is?
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   The other theory starts with men as he is and says all he needs is instruction
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   and education and knowledge and acts of parliament and you can legislate a perfect world.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   But it's a complete failure as Rome was, Great Britain is tonight.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   And it always will be.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Our Lord, you see, can give us a new birth.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   This is why he alone has the right to be called the Prince.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   He alone can govern us.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   He gives us a new birth, a new nature, a new heart, a new mind, a new outlook.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   It's a miracle that he works in the depth of the soul.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   Indeed it's put like this through the prophet,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   I will put my laws in their mind and write them in their hearts.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Not on statute books in Westminster, not written on tables of stone,
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   not published in newspapers.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   He writes them in our minds, within us and in our hearts.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   He gives us this new nature that makes us love the light and hate the darkness
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   instead of hating the darkness, instead of loving the darkness and hating the light.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   He reverses the whole process and procedure.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   And this is his program.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   He began to do that immediately.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   He takes these individuals, he calls them out of this present evil world.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   He sets them in a new kingdom, he translates them into his own kingdom.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   He calls it the church and he builds them up and he adds to it
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   and it goes on through the running centuries.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   What's he doing? He is gathering a people for himself out of this world and its kingdoms
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   to form his own perfect kingdom of glory which is coming in the future.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   And this has been going on through the centuries and it is going on
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   and it will go on until his purpose is complete.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   Now there he is seated at the right hand of God, he says,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth."
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   When he had purged our sins by himself he sat down on the right hand of God.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   What's he doing there? Waiting until his enemies shall be made his footstool.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   You see while the world is busy and excited about its election and its politics
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   and its gatherings and all its cultures and is still festering to iniquity day by day
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   and increasingly as our very newspapers are showing us
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   there is this other history that the great world treats with disdain
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   as it did his birth, as it did on this occasion here when these people have before
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   this anhedron, this nuisance, this impertinence, this annoyance
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   but he's going on with it and nothing can prevent him.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   He is waiting until his enemies shall be made his footstool
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   and then in his own time he will come back again into this world.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   You have the description of it in the 19th chapter of the book of Revelation
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   at the beginning, the man riding the white horse with a sword in his mouth
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   his word conquering and to conquer who is he?
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   Oh king of kings and lord of lords.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   This history is going on and nothing can stop it and he will return
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   he will destroy his every enemy and in the imagery of that book
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   these enemies, these beasts, these antagonists, these principles and powers of evil
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   will be cast to a lake of fire and of destruction
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   and he will set up his glorious kingdom of righteousness and peace
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   of holiness and of joy and we shall hear the angel trumpeting
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdom of our God
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   and of his Christ.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   My dear friends, there is a day coming as certainly as we are in this chapel
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   at this moment when at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   for things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, Prince, Governor
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   to the glory of God the Father.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   There is a day coming, thank God for this, when all your human, political
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   and social and cultural systems have finally failed
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   when we shall see peace like a river and righteousness like the waves of the sea.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   A king shall reign in righteousness.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   There is a day coming when the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   as the waters cover the sea.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   It's coming my friends, God has started this, this is God's history.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   In spite of the opposition of men and nations, in spite of the failure
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   and the miserable wretchedness of his own people, he's been carrying it on
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   in the fullness of the times Christ came.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   The world killed him, God raised him and he's seated at his right hand
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   and he's conquering and to conquer and this will come
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   and this is the ultimate consummation to which the whole creation
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   is surely and steadily moving.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Very well my friends, I leave you with a word like this.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   You've got to take a choice and a decision next Thursday.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Don't misunderstand me, it's not my object nor intention to say
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   that we don't need politics and that it's something to which we can remain indifferent.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   No, no, I've told you that God has ordered it and appointed it
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   and it's our business every one of us to register a vote
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   as honestly and as intelligently as we can.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   But at the same time, I would remind you of this,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   that whatever you do next Thursday, whatever the majority of the people
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   of this country do next Thursday, the real fundamental problems
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   will be left entirely unaffected.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   The problem of you in your personal life and everybody else like you,
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   the problem that no acts of Parliament can ever solve
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   because it's in the heart of men and in the mind of men.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   Oh yes, render your vote, render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   but in the name of God, I warn you, I plead with you, don't stop at that,
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   the things that are God's.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   The really vital question for all of us is this,
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   not which party are you going to vote for.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   That's all right in its relevance, but the vital question is this,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   which kingdom do you belong to?
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   Do you belong to the kingdoms of this world only?
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   Or do you belong to the kingdom of our God and of his Christ?
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   This is a kingdom that cannot be shaken.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   We are all face to face with this.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   There is a personal salvation, personal deliverance, thank God for it,
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   but you're all involved in it, you can't contract out of it,
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   for Christ is going to put the whole cosmos in order,
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   he's going to destroy evil and sin and all that belong to it.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   And if you do belong to it, you will partake of that destruction
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   and that eternal misery.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   Here's the great question, are you aware of God's history,
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   of God's purpose, of God's kingdom?
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Are you being governed by God's prince,
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   the prince of peace, the king of righteousness?
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Are you looking forward to the day when his glory
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   and the glory of the knowledge of the Lord
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   shall cover the whole of the entire cosmos
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   as the waters cover the sea?
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince,
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   the prince, the governor of the whole universe.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   Have you bowed at his name?
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   Have you fallen at his feet?
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   In gratitude, in praise, and in thanksgiving,
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   for his ever-loving coming to the world,
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   for his dying for you and for your sins,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   have you yielded yourself and your life to him?
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   And are you looking forward to the crowning day
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   when he shall be crowned Lord of all?
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   Amen.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
