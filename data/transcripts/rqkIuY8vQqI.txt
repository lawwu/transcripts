[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   This week we celebrate the death of our Savior.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Today we're going to look at the crucifixion from its historical and physical realities.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Next time we'll look at the spiritual meaning and the theological implications of the cross.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   But we begin with the simple and deplorable reality of this form of human extermination.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   With that in mind, the following is a special reading for the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   taken from Fleming Rutledge's book, "The Crucifixion, Understanding the Death of Jesus Christ."
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Pages 89 to 95.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Her book is especially vivid and strong on this point.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   It is formidably difficult to understand the cross today in its original context
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   after 2,000 years in which it has been domesticated, romanticized, idealized, and misappropriated.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Occasionally a modern interpreter struggling to find some correspondence that can be grasped by people today
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   will compare the cross of Roman times to the American electric chair.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   This is an inadequate analogy for a number of reasons as we shall see.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   We can learn a few things from it.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Imagine revering an electric chair.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Imagine using it as the focal point in our churches,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   hanging small replicas around our necks,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   carrying it aloft in procession,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   and bowing our heads as it passes.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   The absurdity of this scenario can readily be grasped.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   But other features in the comparison might help us too.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   For example, the electric chair, when it was still used,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   was almost always used for electrocuting the lowest class of criminal,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   a majority of them black,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   with no powerful connections or other resources.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Similarly, the Romans virtually never used the cross for executing people who had occupied high positions,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   and never for a Roman citizen.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Another point of contact is the contradictory response of revulsion and attraction
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   familiar to anyone who has ever slowed to look at a wreck on the highway.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Even the most fastidious person, when confronted by a photograph of an electric chair,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   let alone the real thing, will experience a disturbing fascination.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   There have always been people who specialized in coming to cheer and applaud executions when they took place,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   whether lynchings, hangings, or electrocutions.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   That is what undoubtedly happened on Calvary when Jesus was nailed to the cross and left there to die.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Crowds of people, then as now, took pleasure in reviling the one who was being put to death.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   When they became bored with this pastime, they went home safely to their comforts
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   and gave the victim no further thought.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   But there are very important differences.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Electrocutions were at least theoretically supposed to be humane and quick,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   but crucifixion as a method of execution was specifically designed to intensify and prolong agony.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   In this sense, the cross was infinitely more dreadful than the electric chair.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Odious, though, the chair was.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Another difference is that the person to be electrocuted is permitted the dignity of a mask or a hood.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   But most important of all, electrocutions took place indoors, out of public view,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   with only a few select people permitted to watch.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Crucifixion, on the other hand, was supposed to be seen by as many people as possible.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Debasement resulting from public display was a chief feature of the method, along with the prolonging of agony.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   It was a form of advertisement or public announcement.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   "This person is the scum of the earth, not fit to live, more an insect than a human being."
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   The crucified wretch was pinned up like a specimen.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Crosses were not placed out in the open for convenience or sanitation, but for maximum public exposure.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Crucifixion as a means of execution in the Roman Empire had as its express purpose
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   the elimination of victims from consideration as members of the human race.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   It cannot be said too strongly. That was its function.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It was meant to indicate to all who might be toying with subversive ideas that crucified persons were not of the same species
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   as either the executioners or the spectators, and were therefore not only expendable,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   but also deserving of ritualized extermination.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Therefore, the mocking and jeering that accompanied crucifixion were not only allowed,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   they were part of the spectacle, and were programmed into it.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   In a sense, crucifixion was a form of entertainment.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Everyone understood that the specific role of the passerby was to exacerbate the dehumanization
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   and degradation of the person who had been thus designated to be a spectacle.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Crucifixion was cleverly designed, we might say diabolically designed,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   to be an almost theatrical enactment of the sadistic and inhumane impulses that lie within human beings.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   According to the Christian gospel, the Son of God voluntarily and purposefully absorbed all of that,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   drawing it into himself.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Anyone seeking to interpret Jesus' crucifixion must decide whether or not to include a clinical description.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Since the New Testament writers are conspicuously silent about the physical details,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   it is legitimate to ask whether it is suitable or helpful to introduce them.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   On the other hand, people in New Testament times had all seen crucifixions,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   and did not need a description.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   The evangelists and the other New Testament writers were able to assume a familiarity
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   with the method that is unthinkable for us today.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Most of us have never even come close to seeing anyone tortured to death.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   For this reason, Martin Engel writes,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   "Reflection on the harsh reality of crucifixion in antiquity may help us to overcome the acute loss of reality
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   which is to be found so often in present theology and preaching."
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   The early theologian Origen called Jesus' death the "utterly vile death of the cross."
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Cicero, the great Roman statesman and writer, referred to crucifixion as the "supreme penalty"
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   exceeding burning and decapitation and gruesomeness.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Some rudimentary knowledge of what was taking place will help us to understand these terms.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   The first phase of a Roman execution was scourging.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   The lictors, the Roman legionaries assigned to this duty,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   used a whip made of leather cords to which small pieces of metal or bone had been fastened.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Paintings of the scourging of Jesus always show him with a loincloth.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   But in fact the victim would have been naked,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   tied to a post in a position to expose the back and the buttocks to maximum effect.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   With the first strokes of the scourge, skin would be pulled away and subcutaneous tissue exposed.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   As the process continued, the lacerations would begin to tear the underlying skeletal muscles.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   This would result not only in great pain, but also in considerable blood loss.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   The idea was to weaken the victim to a state just short of collapse or death.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   It was common for taunting and ridicule to accompany the procedure.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   In the case of Jesus, the New Testament tells us that a crown of thorns,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   a purple robe, and a mock scepter were added to intensify the mockery.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   The condition of a prisoner after scourging just prior to crucifixion would depend on several things.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Previous physical condition, the enthusiasm of the lictors, and the extent of blood loss.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   In the case of Jesus, these things cannot be known,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   but the fact that he was apparently unable to carry the crossbar himself
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   would indicate that he was probably in a severely weakened state,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   and he may have been close to circulatory shock.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Those being crucified were then paraded through the streets,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   exposing them to the full scorn of the population.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   When the procession reached the site of crucifixion,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   the victims would see before them the heavy upright wooden posts permanently in place,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   to which the crossbar was to be attached by a mortise and tenon joint.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   The person to be crucified would be thrown down on his back,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   exacerbating the pain of the wounds from his scourging and introducing dirt into them.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   His hands would be tied or nailed to the crossbar.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Nailing seems to have been preferred by the Romans.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Ossuary finds have given us a clearer idea of how this was done.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Two thousand years of Christian iconography notwithstanding,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   the nails were not driven into the palms,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   which could not support the weight of a man's body,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   but into the wrists.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   [Screams]
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   The crossbar was then hoisted on the wooden posts where the victim depended from it,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   and the feet were tied or nailed.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   At this point, the process of crucifixion proper began.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Victims of crucifixion lived on their crosses for periods varying from three or four hours to three or four days.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Passive exhalation, which we do thousands of times a day without thinking about it,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   becomes impossible for a person hanging on a cross.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   The weight of a body hanging by its wrist would depress the muscles required for breathing out.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Therefore, each exhaled breath could only be achieved by a tremendous effort.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   The only way to gain a breath at all would be by pushing oneself up from the legs and the feet,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   or pulling oneself up by the arms,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   either of which would cause intense agony.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Add to this primary factor the following secondary ones.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Bodily functions uncontrolled.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Insects feasting on wounds and orifices.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Unspeakable thirst.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Muscle cramps.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Bolts of pain from the severed median nerves in the wrists,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   scourged back scraping against the wooden post.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   It is more than any of us are capable of fully imagining.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   The verbal abuse and other actions,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   such as spitting and throwing refuse by the spectators, Roman soldiers, and passerbys,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   added the final touch.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   The New Testament shows us life lived between two worlds,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   the Roman and the near Middle Eastern.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Crucifixion was noxious enough in Roman eyes.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Palestinian attitudes would have found it perhaps even more so.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Middle Eastern cultures still have to this day an acute sense of personal honor lodged in the body.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   An amputation, administered as punishment for instance,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   would be seen as much more than just physical cruelty or permanent handicap.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   It would mean that the amputee would carry the visible marks of dishonor and shame for the rest of his or her life.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Anything done to the body would have been understood as exceptionally cruel,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   not just because it inflicted pain, but even more because it caused dishonor.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Furthermore, the Passion accounts reflect in part a very ancient ritual of humiliation.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   The mocking of Jesus, the spitting and scorn, the inversion of his kingship,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   and the studious dethronement with the crown of thorns and purple robe
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   would have been understood as a central part of a total rite of infamy,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   of which the crucifixion itself is the culmination.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Another aspect of the crucifixion not widely noted
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   is that a crucified person, gasping and heaving on his cross,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   is forced to be his own executioner.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   He is not even allowed the perverse dignity of having a human being corresponding to himself
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   who hangs or decapitates him.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   He dies truly and completely alone,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   with the weight of his own body killing him as it hangs.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Causing his own diaphragm to suffocate him.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   [wind]
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   [fire crackling]
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   [fire crackling]
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   [fire crackling]

[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   [crow cawing]
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   [crow cawing]
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   [crow cawing]
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   This ends a reading from Fleming Rutledge's book, "The Crucifixion,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Understanding the Death of Jesus Christ," pages 89 to 95.
