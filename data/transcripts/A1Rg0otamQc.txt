[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.320]   Hayden writes in to ask, "Matthew 18, verses 2-4 talk about having a childlike faith.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.520]   In 1 Corinthians 13, 11, Paul says that when he became a man, he put away childish things.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.480]   Pastor John, can you explain the differences and the similarities between childlike faith
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.000]   and becoming a spiritually mature man?"
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.240]   Well, in summary, Tony, the way I would put it is, trust like a child, think like a man.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.840]   First Corinthians 14, "Do not be children in your thinking.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.880]   Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature."
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.920]   So clearly we're not supposed to be like children in our thinking.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.880]   Or 2 Timothy 2-7, "Think over what I say, Timothy.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.520]   The Lord will give you understanding."
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.480]   Or 1 Corinthians 13 that the questioner referred to, "When I was a child, I spoke like a child.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.480]   I thought like a child.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.480]   I reasoned like a child.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.120]   When I became a man, I gave up childish ways."
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.720]   And so, no, a mature man shouldn't think like a one-year-old.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.800]   One-year-olds can't think.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.320]   They can't reason out what they need to.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.720]   And the Bible says, John 7, "Do not judge by appearances.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.000]   Judge with right judgment."
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.080]   In other words, as you grow older, you learn how to make right judgments.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.520]   That's what we want for our kids.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.480]   We don't want them to use their minds at age 15 like they did at age 5.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.920]   We want them to have the capacities to make judgments, test all things, hold fast to what
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.520]   is good.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.880]   Why?
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.760]   Because you shall love the Lord your God with all your mind, the Bible says.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:50.160]   In fact, here's a really strange and provocative word from Paul in 1 Corinthians 8.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.960]   "Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.120]   If anyone imagines that he knows something, he doesn't yet know as he ought to know."
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:09.320]   My interpretation of that is right knowing is in the service of loving.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.640]   And if your knowing doesn't produce loving, you don't know right yet.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.800]   And now I would say the same thing about faith.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.240]   Right knowing or right thinking, the right use of your mature mind, is for the sake of
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.820]   childlike faith.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.840]   We should grow up in our thinking so that we can grow down in our humility, so that
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.280]   we can have faith like a child.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.560]   So the text that was referred to was, "Truly I say to you, unless you turn and become like
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.920]   a child, you'll never enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.000]   Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.960]   So the point there is humility.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.240]   What kind of humility?
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:05.480]   Well, picture a little child in a stroller, standing in line at a bank with his mom, and
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.560]   all these people are around him fretting about their finances.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.880]   And he's asleep in this totally public, anxious, financially driven setting.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.880]   Why?
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.640]   Because he knows mama is right there.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.640]   Mama's right there.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.080]   I don't worry about where my next meal is coming from.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.760]   I don't worry about my finances and whether I'm going to be able to pay for college.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.160]   My mama is right behind the stroller.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.160]   That's what I know.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.040]   If I didn't believe that, I'd panic.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.120]   But that's what faith is.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.320]   So childlike faith is a humble faith that sits in a stroller, believes God is standing
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.920]   behind us, doesn't get anxious about all kinds of things.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:58.240]   And the reason God gave us brains, mature, adult, sophisticated, hard-thinking, studying
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.480]   brains, is to understand the Bible and the work of God well enough to become that kind
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.480]   of child.
