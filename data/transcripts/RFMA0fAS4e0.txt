[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   I think at this point, large scale reliable data
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.700]   is really important, but also important
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.120]   are the human stories.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.320]   And something that caught my eye was the day in the life
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.880]   of an emergency room doctor, Craig Spencer,
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.200]   that he revealed in a series of tweets.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.000]   Thank you everyone for the incredible messages
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.760]   of support and encouragement.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.400]   Many of you asked what it was like
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.320]   in the emergency room right now.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.360]   I want to share a bit with you.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.640]   A day in the life of an emergency room doc,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.560]   a brief dispatch from the COVID-19 frontline.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.320]   Wake up at 6.30 a.m.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.140]   Priority is making a big pot of coffee for the whole day
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200]   because the place by the hospital is closed.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.800]   The Starbucks too, it's all closed.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.660]   On the walk, it feels like Sunday, nobody's out.
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.620]   Might be the freezing rain or it's early,
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.840]   regardless, that's good.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.640]   Walk in for the 9 a.m. shift,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.600]   immediately struck by how the calm
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.460]   of the early morning city streets
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.380]   is immediately transformed.
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.060]   The bright fluorescent lights of the emergency room
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.640]   reflect off everybody's protective goggles.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.960]   There's a cacophony of coughing.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.560]   You stop, mask up, walk in.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.840]   You take sign out from the previous team,
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.840]   but nearly every patient is the same, young and old.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.280]   Cough, shortness of breath, fever.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.660]   They're really worried about one patient,
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.340]   very short of breath, on the maximum amount of oxygen
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.360]   we can give, but still breathing fast.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.460]   You immediately assess this patient.
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.020]   It's clear what this is and what needs to happen.
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.180]   You have a long and honest discussion with the patient
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.860]   and family over the phone.
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.120]   It's best to put her on life support now
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.260]   before things get much worse.
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.040]   You're getting set up for that,
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.700]   but you're notified of another really sick patient coming in.
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.900]   You rush over.
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.640]   They're also extremely sick, vomiting.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.980]   They need to be put on life support as well.
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.660]   You bring them back.
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.120]   Two patients in rooms right next to each other,
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.900]   both getting a breathing tube.
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.220]   It's not even 10 a.m. yet.
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.300]   For the rest of your shift,
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.540]   nearly every hour you get paged.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.900]   Stat notification, very sick patient,
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.340]   short of breath, fever, oxygen 88%.
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.580]   Stat notification, low blood pressure,
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.260]   short of breath, low oxygen.
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.220]   Stat notification, low oxygen, can't breathe, fever.
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.400]   All day.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.500]   Sometime in the afternoon,
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.700]   you recognize you haven't drank any water.
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.540]   You're afraid to take off the mask.
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.520]   It's the only thing that protects you.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.900]   Surely you can last a little longer.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.500]   In West Africa during Ebola,
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.220]   you spent hours in a hot suit without water.
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.480]   One more patient.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.640]   By late afternoon, you need to eat.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.080]   Restaurant across the street is closed.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.380]   Right, everything's closed.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.800]   But thankfully, the hospital cafeteria is open.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.560]   You grab something, wash your hands twice,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.720]   cautiously take off your mask and eat as fast as you can.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.700]   Go back, mask up, walk in.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.220]   Nearly everyone you see today is the same.
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.020]   We assume everyone is COVID-19.
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.840]   We wear gowns, goggles and masks at every encounter,
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.880]   all day.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.920]   It's the only way to be safe.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.460]   Where did all the heart attacks
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.000]   and appendicitis patients go?
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.260]   It's all COVID.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.480]   When your shift ends, you sign out to the oncoming team.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.280]   It's all COVID-19.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.720]   Over the past week, we've all learned the signs.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.920]   He goes on to list the signs,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.440]   one of which is low oxygen.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.640]   You share concerns of friends throughout the city
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.840]   without personal protective equipment,
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.320]   hospitals running out of ventilators.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.400]   Before you leave, you wipe everything down.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.520]   Your phone, your badge, your wallet, your coffee mug,
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.140]   all of it, drown it in bleach.
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.680]   Everything in a bag, take no chances.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.160]   Sure you got it all?
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.480]   Wipe it down again.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.040]   Can't be too careful.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.080]   You walk out and take off your mask.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.160]   You feel naked and exposed.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.080]   It's still raining, but you want to walk home.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.540]   It feels safer than the subway or bus.
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.680]   Plus, you need to decompress.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.120]   The streets are empty.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.160]   This feels nothing like what is happening inside.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.400]   Maybe people don't know.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.760]   You get home, you strip in the hallway.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.960]   It's okay, your neighbors know what you do.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.240]   Everything in a bag.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.360]   Your wife tries to keep your toddler away,
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.680]   but she hasn't seen you in days, so it's really hard.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.960]   Run to the shower, rinse it all away.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.280]   Never happier.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.380]   Time for family.
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.760]   You reflect on the fact that it's really hard
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.160]   to understand how bad this is and how bad it's going to be
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.320]   if all you see are empty streets,
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.280]   hospitals are nearing capacity,
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.080]   we're running out of ventilators,
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.980]   ambulance sirens don't stop.
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.040]   Everyone we see today was infected a week ago or more.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.960]   The numbers will undoubtedly skyrocket overnight
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.840]   as they have every night the past few days.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.880]   More will come to the emergency room.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.960]   More will be stat notifications.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.000]   More will be put on a ventilator.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.560]   We were too late to stop the virus, full stop,
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.960]   but we can slow its spread.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.500]   The virus can't infect those it never meets.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.720]   Stay inside.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.600]   Social distancing is the only thing that will save us now.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.840]   You might hear people say it isn't real.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.040]   It is.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.560]   You might hear people say it isn't bad.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.800]   It is.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.800]   You might hear people say it can't take you down.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.320]   It can.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.280]   I survived Ebola.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.880]   I fear COVID-19.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.000]   Do your part.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Stay home.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.120]   Stay safe.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.360]   And every day I'll come to work for you.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.100]   This is a moving or counting through a series of tweets
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.160]   by an emergency room doctor
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.300]   on the very front lines of fighting COVID-19.
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.720]   Without question, the best thing we can do now is stay home
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.800]   while people like Craig Spencer,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.120]   doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, service workers,
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.720]   support us and treat the people who are sick.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.280]   And really importantly,
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.560]   as we get more and more reliable data.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.320]   This isn't the time to panic.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.240]   This is a time to take optimal action
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.640]   given that we're operating under a huge amount
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.680]   of uncertainty.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.160]   The two things we need to do is the most important
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.400]   is to save lives.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.740]   And the second is collect good, reliable data.
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.560]   Before we can reopen the economy,
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.640]   we have to get good data to understand the spread
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.040]   of the virus in order to be able to control it.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.960]   And all the while treating people who are sick
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.800]   without overwhelming the resources of our medical system.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.120]   Stay safe out there.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.000]   Stay informed.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Stay strong.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.240]   We'll beat this thing.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.080]   Love you all.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.560]   (upbeat music)
