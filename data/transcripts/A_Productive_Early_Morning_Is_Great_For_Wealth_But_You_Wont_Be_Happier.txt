[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai,
[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.840]   and in this episode I want to talk about sleep
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.800]   and why sleep is all the rage,
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.180]   and why I don't think getting more sleep
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.640]   will make you happier.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.080]   It might make you richer,
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.000]   but I'm not sure it's gonna make you happier at all.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.600]   So let's quantify how much richer you can get
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.960]   if you sleep less and be more productive with your time.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.280]   So let's say the average person wakes up at 7 a.m.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.780]   to start their day and goes to bed at 11 p.m.
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.080]   You decide to wake up at 5.30 a.m.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.360]   and work for one hour every day for a year
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.920]   because that's what some productivity guru told you to do.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.800]   You go to bed at the same time,
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.960]   so how much richer will you be in a year?
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.520]   Well, just calculate your hourly wage.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.160]   What are you worth per hour?
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.340]   10 bucks, 50 bucks?
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.600]   Let's say you're worth 100 bucks an hour.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.840]   You will be $36,500 richer
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.760]   than the average person over a year.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.640]   Assuming the hourly rate and bedtime stays the same,
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.780]   over a 10-year period, you will be worth 365,000 more
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.920]   than the average person, assuming no growth rate either.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.720]   Now, if you slap on a 7% compound annual return
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.040]   during this time period,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.220]   you're gonna be worth 540,000 more than the average person.
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.660]   And then you multiply this by several decades,
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.340]   and well, frankly, you're gonna be millions of dollars
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.700]   richer than the average person who sleeps in,
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.040]   watches TV all day, and twiddles his or her thumbs
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.320]   playing video games.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.200]   You know, I'm always, always amazed
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.640]   every time I'm on the bus or on the subway
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.840]   or on the plane or in the lounge,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.800]   people are just always on their phones,
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.600]   glued to their phones.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.560]   If you haven't checked your hourly usage rate
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.800]   for your phone yet, check it out.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.440]   It's probably in the four to eight hour a day range.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.280]   And that's a lot, especially if you're just
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.200]   consuming information and not producing information.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.000]   I wanna challenge you guys to start producing things
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.760]   instead of consuming things.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.080]   That's like a 180 degree difference
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.680]   that will really add up and build your wealth over time
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.260]   if you can get that going.
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.980]   So if you wanna get rich or richer than average,
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.480]   it's pretty simple, just work more.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.360]   I've got this pretty popular post called,
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.640]   are there really people who work 40 hours a week or less
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.180]   and then complain why they can't get ahead?
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.880]   I know it really kinda pisses people off,
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.080]   but it's just math.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.880]   You don't have to be smarter.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.240]   You just have to wake up a little bit earlier
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.120]   and do a little bit more work
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.840]   and compound that productivity over many, many years
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.520]   and really good things are gonna happen.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.280]   Unfortunately, I don't think working more and being richer
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.320]   will necessarily make you happier.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.200]   Instead, I think there's a great argument to be made
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.600]   that those who work less and can afford the luxury
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.960]   of regularly sleeping in in a continuous fashion
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.640]   have a much better life.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.960]   So let me explain with my own situation.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.600]   From 1999 to 2012, the average time I got up
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.440]   was 5 a.m.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.920]   I got up at 5 a.m. not because I wanted to,
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920]   but because I had to for work.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.400]   If I didn't get into work by 5.30 a.m.,
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.020]   I would've just been fired.
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.840]   And also, the stock market opened at 9.30 a.m.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.160]   Eastern Standard Time and 6.30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.840]   and I had to do a bunch of research preparation
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.620]   and reading and distributing and coffee running
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.280]   and just being a gopher
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.440]   during my first two years in finance.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.800]   So that was that.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.140]   I remember in college, I dropped a class,
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.080]   an 8 a.m. class because it was just way too early.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.140]   So just think about trying to wake up at 5 a.m.
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.320]   to go to work at 5.30.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.640]   That was kind of brutal,
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.920]   especially since I had to stay
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.040]   until about 7.30 p.m. every day.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.840]   Once I left my banking job,
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.920]   I thought I'd start sleeping in way more,
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.020]   but not the case at all.
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.100]   After 13 years, my body was already conditioned
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.240]   like Pavlov's dog and I continued to wake up at 5 a.m.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.320]   until about mid-2017.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.880]   So if I went to bed at 11 p.m., I'd wake up at 5 a.m.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.920]   If I went to bed at 12 midnight, I would wake up at 5 a.m.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.480]   and I'd wake up at 5 a.m. if I went to bed at 1 a.m.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.720]   It was just kind of the darnedest thing.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.000]   But in mid-2017, everything changed
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.180]   because our son was born
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.360]   and as any parent or new parent knows,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.940]   sleep gets severely disrupted, right?
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.980]   Every two hours, you're feeding
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.000]   and the baby's crying for whatever reason
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.260]   and parents gotta attend or else.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.520]   After about three months, thank God my wife
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.560]   decided to take over night duties
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.220]   to allow me to write and also to record podcasts
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.280]   because there's no way to write and record a podcast
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.300]   other than in absolute silence.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.880]   So something else started happening in early 2018.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.240]   After regularly going to bed at around 11.30 p.m.,
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.480]   I found myself waking up by 4 a.m. on average.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.760]   When I was waking up in the pitch black every morning,
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.600]   I always guessed the time,
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.800]   thinking, hoping there would be a five handle,
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.760]   maybe a six handle sometimes,
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.640]   but nope, those handles never came.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.240]   It was always around 4 a.m. that I'd wake up
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.040]   in the middle of the pitch black morning.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.640]   Often, I'd look out into the ocean
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.740]   to find comfort that a lone fisherman
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.600]   or maybe two had started his day even earlier.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.080]   So let me share what's going on with me
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.060]   and why I'm now waking up an hour earlier
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.340]   than my already early morning.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.320]   I'm not doing this on purpose, folks,
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.200]   because I don't set my alarm clock.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.680]   I'm doing so naturally out of circumstance and necessity.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.500]   So here's some reasons.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.440]   One, anxiety and excitement have increased.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.720]   For a while, I was scheduling posts for publication
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.920]   at 2.30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time,
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.320]   and I did this because I like to wake up
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.080]   at around 5 a.m. after the post had marinated
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.780]   in the public for several hours.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.560]   So it allowed people like yourself to read it,
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.320]   comment, and it was always fun.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.360]   It felt like Christmas morning every morning.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.080]   But the problem is, the more I wrote,
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.120]   the more anxiety and excitement I had.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.480]   And so when I regularly started posting
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.460]   three times a week plus a newsletter,
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.400]   so the newsletter edition every week,
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.080]   it was an edition, my anxiety and excitement
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.920]   went up about 33%, right, going from three to four.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.380]   And then now that I'm doing these podcasts regularly,
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.640]   I've also got on my mind, hey, what should I talk about,
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.740]   how should I write, how are the podcasts gonna perform,
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.880]   and so forth.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.760]   So it does feel like Christmas morning
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.120]   as a kid every morning, which is a great feeling.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.500]   However, some days I have a feeling of dread,
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.800]   like waiting in the lobby of the principal's office.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.240]   And I know that feeling quite well
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.560]   because I went to the principal's office
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.760]   so many times in elementary school, middle school,
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.960]   and high school.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.840]   I was in trouble all the time,
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.880]   whether it was due to fighting
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.560]   or being an insubordinate student, and just other stuff.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.560]   So the more I produced, the more opinions that I gave,
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.720]   the more things that I've done,
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.000]   the less I slept because, hey,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.320]   I wanted to see how the world would react.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.040]   It's just like working on something
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.600]   for a very, very long time,
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.960]   and then going live with that project at work or something.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.640]   There's just a lot of anticipation and anxiety
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.120]   that goes through these things.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.480]   And so as a creator, you're always just kind of wondering
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.480]   how will the public react.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.240]   All right, another reason why I'm waking up earlier,
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.760]   I think it's because I'm simply getting older.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.240]   They say you don't need as much sleep as you get older,
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.320]   and I say they're absolutely right.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.920]   Older people wake up more often
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.000]   because they spend less time in a deep sleep.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.680]   Other causes include needing to get up and urinate,
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.160]   that's called nocturia, anxiety and discomfort,
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.480]   or pain from long-term chronic illnesses.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.560]   Thankfully, I don't have any of that.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.760]   I find I need to go to the bathroom like once a night now.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.840]   And I remember my buddy telling me at 50 years old,
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.520]   just wait until you get to 50,
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.520]   you'll see how many times
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.280]   you have to go to the bathroom every night.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.440]   And he's true.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.520]   Even though I try not to drink
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.520]   at least an hour before I go to bed,
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.880]   I often still find myself getting up to go to the bathroom.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.120]   Three, regular afternoon siestas.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.440]   Napping can ruin evening sleep,
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.120]   but I just can't help myself for taking a siesta after lunch
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.160]   about 95% of the time.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.560]   It just feels like part of your natural rhythm.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.840]   And I think it is your natural rhythm.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.760]   At around one o'clock, people get sleepy,
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.960]   that's why people go get coffee to force themselves awake.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.280]   Well, because I don't have anywhere to go
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.800]   and I don't have a job,
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.280]   I just go the path of least resistance and take a nap.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.400]   And these naps can last between 15 minutes
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   to sometimes an hour and a half,
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.480]   which I think probably really wrecks nighttime sleep.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.240]   Being able to nap every day is a great example
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.360]   of how an easy life can ruin your work ethic.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.680]   This is why being a solopreneur, working from home,
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.280]   just doing your own thing is really hard
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.360]   because you have to be very disciplined.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.120]   You've got to follow your own schedule
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.520]   because nobody's going to tell you what to do.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.600]   It's kind of like, well, I would say being able to nap
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.360]   is kind of like having your parents buy you a house
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.000]   and maybe a Mercedes Benz after graduation.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.520]   You know, if you got the house and the car,
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.200]   I mean, why bother working late at work,
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.520]   building relationships, trying hard at all?
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.960]   You'd probably just kick back and relax
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.280]   like my neighbor's son, who's 29 years old this year,
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.840]   and probably going to stay at home for the rest of his life.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.240]   So if you've ever seen the movie "Da Vinci Code"
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.080]   and the guy Silas, and he whips himself in the back,
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.760]   well, I feel kind of like him,
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.880]   where I'm whipping myself to do some work
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.640]   and to not slack off too much and take my luck for granted.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.560]   Four, this is a really important one.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.520]   The pressure to provide has increased.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.760]   None of us work.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.200]   My wife stays at home and does a great job being a mom.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.760]   I stay at home and I try to be a stay-at-home dad.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.800]   We don't have the security of day jobs.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.560]   And when we didn't have children,
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.680]   well, that was okay because, well,
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.320]   there was the passive income
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.120]   and then also the severance packages that we had.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.440]   But when you have a kid, I don't know,
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.000]   something changes inside you.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.360]   It's like we're wired to provide no matter how much we have
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.800]   or no matter how many times we run the numbers.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.440]   With the increased pressure to provide for a family,
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.160]   I've also become more sensitive about investment swings.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.800]   So during the fourth quarter of 2018,
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.280]   I gotta admit, I was pretty stressed.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.880]   I think my portfolio was down
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.040]   probably around $500,000 at the low point,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.760]   even though it's a pretty conservative portfolio.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.520]   So I don't really care how much you have.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.720]   That absolute dollar figure,
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.360]   if it's way more than what you spend a year,
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.800]   is gonna feel painful.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.000]   It's gonna hurt and it's gonna feel a little scary.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.160]   So just know this for folks who are on the path
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.600]   to financial independence or who have retired.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.240]   Be conservative with your portfolio.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.280]   If you already won the game,
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.800]   you can look out for a two to 5% rate of return.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.640]   I think that's great
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.840]   because you're beating inflation by a little bit
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.720]   and you're probably not gonna have as much volatility.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.200]   You don't want to have that volatility
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.680]   once you've retired or left your job
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.000]   because that feeling is not worth it.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.520]   You wanna be retired and have peace of mind, folks,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.080]   because it's just two step forwards, one step back
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.720]   if you're just worried about your money
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.880]   and you're thinking, well,
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.600]   maybe I need to get a part-time job
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.920]   or maybe I need to find a full-time job.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.200]   You don't wanna feel that way once you've decided to retire.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.920]   And then the final reason why I don't think
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.580]   I can sleep that long is because my friend died young.
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.360]   I was 13 years old and in Malaysia while this happened.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.960]   He was driving a little too fast
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.920]   after going to the nightclub with another friend
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.480]   and then he spun out, hit a tree,
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.480]   and he and a passenger died.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.560]   And it was really traumatic because I didn't know he died.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.440]   What happened was I went to Taiwan for some summer activity.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.360]   I came back and I called his house and his mom picked up
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.360]   and I asked her, hey, is Mark available to talk or to play?
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.240]   And she told me, and I'll never forget it,
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.320]   Mark died last week.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.400]   Think about how traumatizing that is for a 13-year-old
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   to listen to a mother say that her son passed away.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.960]   And all I could do was say sorry and hang up
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.760]   and just wrestle with my mind on what the hell just happened.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.480]   I couldn't understand it.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.720]   But now as an adult, I feel there's just no way
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.360]   I can slack off and sleep in
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.320]   because my friend never got a chance.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.680]   If he had, he would have done amazing things for this world.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.400]   Every time I feel like slacking off,
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.940]   I think about him or the time when I was swarmed
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.200]   by beggars in Agra or in Penang, Malaysia.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.580]   I think about my neighbor's daughter
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.240]   who has severe cerebral palsy
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.120]   and she's confined to a wheelchair and she can't speak.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.360]   And it just is so heartbreaking and it makes me angry.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.840]   It makes me angry that some people don't have the chance
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.120]   to do what they want and it makes me angry that children,
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.880]   children are being taken away from their parents
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.680]   for no good reason.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.020]   So my mind is constantly being reminded of these people
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:53.000]   who don't have the same opportunities I have.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.280]   And to not give 100% would be like insulting them
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:01.280]   all because I know they would give 110% if they were me.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.520]   If you conquer the morning,
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.380]   I believe you will conquer the day.
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.200]   Getting one important thing done before the day starts
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.000]   is like paying yourself first.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.600]   No matter what happens during the day,
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.680]   at least you did something productive.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.560]   No matter how much you spend during the day,
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.980]   at least you saved some money.
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.300]   Being able to function regularly
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.360]   on just five to six hours of sleep a day
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.280]   is both a blessing and a curse.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.720]   I'm definitely able to get a lot more done
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.560]   without having to be any smarter than average.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.240]   However, sometimes I sure would love to be able to sleep in
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.200]   and sleep seven to nine hours continuously.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.540]   When I hear my friends sleeping in, I'm jealous.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.380]   I'd love to sleep in because I would say
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.360]   one out of three times I dream.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.000]   And my dreams are amazing.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.080]   They're of flying, they're of seeing new places,
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.080]   they're of doing a lot of fun activities.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.920]   I just love it.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.360]   So if you're able to sleep in every day,
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.760]   I think you should feel blessed.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.720]   It may mean that you are not suffering
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.280]   the same amount of guilt or anxiety or pressure
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.120]   as many other early risers do.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.400]   There's no need to get up early, frankly.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.040]   There's also a good chance you may also feel
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.060]   more financially secure because of your own doing
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.960]   or because someone is providing for you.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.720]   And if someone is providing for you,
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.480]   don't forget to say thank you
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.960]   and give him or her a lot of love, attention, and respect.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.760]   If you have no financial worries,
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.560]   your mind will surely allow you to relax more often.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.920]   What a blessing I think it is to be so carefree.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.420]   And listen, I know not everybody requires
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.260]   eight or nine hours of sleep.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.960]   Some require five or six.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.000]   Everybody has a different chronotype, they say.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.540]   The average sleep duration in the population
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.160]   is between seven to eight hours.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.160]   Only about 2% or 3% require five hours of sleep
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.880]   or six hours of sleep.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.560]   So you might be a part of that minority population
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.000]   that only needs five to six hours of sleep.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.160]   Maybe, maybe not.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.920]   But if you're looking to get more sleep,
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.200]   I've done a lot of research, I've read a lot of books,
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.480]   and these are some tips that will help you sleep better.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.920]   One, a light bedtime snack may be helpful.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.520]   Many people find that warm milk increases sleepiness
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.140]   because it contains a natural sedative like amino acid.
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.560]   Just make sure you're not lactose intolerant like I am.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.320]   Avoid stimulants such as caffeine
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.560]   three to four hours before bed.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.800]   Don't take naps like I do.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.680]   Exercise moderately in the afternoon.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.880]   Oh man, when I play tennis or softball,
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.520]   I can nap really well or sleep really well.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.560]   But it's still only five to six hours of sleep.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.320]   Avoid too much stimulation such as violent TV shows
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.960]   and horror flicks and computer games before sleep.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.200]   You know, we've got a little boy
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.620]   and we try to cut off his TV, iPad time
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.480]   an hour before he goes to sleep.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.200]   And try to calm down and not, you know,
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.240]   hustle and bustle and tumble and rumble
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.040]   like I do with him all the time.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.920]   Don't drink lots of water within two hours of going to bed.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.060]   Try to go to bed at the same time every night
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.040]   and wake up at the same time each morning.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.840]   Try to use the bed only for sleep and sex, not for work.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.400]   I used to work in my bed for hours and hours.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.200]   I would just prop myself up on the headrest
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.160]   and just go to town.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.800]   Now I get up and go to a home office
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.560]   and work at a table like I'm recording right now.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.720]   Avoid tobacco products, especially before bedtime.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.920]   Try to get a blue light screen for your computer
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.840]   and your iPad and your iPhone.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.040]   Don't use your phone or laptop within an hour of going to bed.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.640]   Try to use a sound machine.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.120]   I use an app called Relax Melodies,
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.360]   which is really great.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.880]   Get blackout curtains or blackout shades.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.640]   And then finally, look into doctor-recommended medication.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.960]   Funny story, I used to take Advil.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.680]   Advil after playing some tennis because my back was sore.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.800]   Or sometimes I'd take Advil before playing tennis just
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.240]   to kind of be preemptive.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.440]   And then one time I was like, hey, what's this Advil PM?
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.720]   And I would just take it.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.260]   And I didn't really know what PM was.
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.680]   I thought Advil PM was take Advil in the afternoon, right?
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.280]   That's what PM is.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.960]   But then my wife told me, no, silly.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.640]   Advil PM is a pain medication to help you sleep better as well.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.120]   So I was like, oh, OK.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.560]   So that could be a good two for one
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.240]   if I'm going to take Advil, or if you're
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.720]   going to take Advil anyway.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.720]   And if you can't fall asleep within 20 minutes,
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.880]   I say get out of bed and do a quiet activity,
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:31.400]   such as reading or listening to music or yoga or meditation.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.040]   Unfortunately, what I do when I wake up
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.000]   in the middle of the night is just go to my computer
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.200]   and write or read.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.920]   And that's just a no-no because it just
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.800]   starts stimulating the brain and the eyes
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.880]   with all that blue light.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.320]   And it's just tough to get back to sleep.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.560]   And it's because also I just get angry that, hey,
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.120]   why am I up at 2 AM?
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.680]   OK, you want to get me up at 2 AM, buddy?
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.000]   I tell myself, OK, well, I'm going to make it productive
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.560]   and do something so that, ha ha, you cannot defeat me.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.320]   So I've got this kind of weird mentality
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.320]   where I always want to try to be productive.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.680]   And again, I think that's kind of a curse and a blessing.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.980]   I don't know what you got, but that's what I got.
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.800]   So I hope everybody gets a better night's sleep.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.200]   I think we're all a little bit suffering from sleep
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.680]   deprivation because there's so much going on in the world.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.280]   There's so much pressure.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.840]   If you're a new parent, it's just kind of inevitability.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.640]   So I think maybe also gratitude and thinking
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.360]   about all the great things that are going on in our lives
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.360]   will help us relax more and sleep better.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.720]   If I can get six hours straight sleep, I'm happy.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.480]   And hopefully, you can get the amount of sleep you require
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.600]   as well.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.960]   Thanks so much for listening.
