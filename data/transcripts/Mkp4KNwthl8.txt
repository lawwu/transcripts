[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   All right, speaking of digital minimum,
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.900]   I think this next question is relevant, right?
[00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.340]   What do we got here?
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.440]   - All right, next question is from Nandan.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.300]   What are the benefits of shutting down the phone usage
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.340]   before going to bed and after waking up?
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.680]   What techniques can I implement
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.060]   to become more disciplined in doing so?
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.940]   - Well, Nandan, I mean, the benefits are massive
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.300]   because what are we really talking about here?
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.680]   If you're using your phone up to the moment you go to bed,
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.240]   if you're using your phone the moment that you wake up,
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.700]   that means that you are constantly
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.640]   in this four-dimensional world
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.200]   where you have the real and the digital
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.720]   and it's all sort of mixed together.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.360]   That's not a humane way to live.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.260]   It's an impoverished approach to reality.
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.880]   It is an anxiety generation machine.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.760]   It is also a, think of it as like a potential magnet,
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.280]   just pulling all this potential
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.440]   for you constructing a life well-lived
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.000]   and just sucking it away and converting it
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.080]   into returns on the stock owners of these giant,
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.920]   people who own stock,
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.240]   these giant attention economy platforms.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.240]   It is no way to live.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.300]   That's the benefit.
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.400]   So how do you get away from it?
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.020]   Well, Nandan, you have to be way more aggressive
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.900]   than what you're talking about here.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.600]   What you're talking about here, I see all the time.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.080]   You want to nibble at the edges with tips.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.880]   I use my phone too much.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.160]   Do you have a good tip?
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.380]   Like maybe I should stop not bringing the bedroom
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.760]   or I should have a time I start turning on my phone.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.860]   This is not how we solve this problem.
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.000]   When your life is entirely enmeshed with the digital,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.220]   we do not solve this problem
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.780]   by nibbling at the edges with tips.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.640]   We don't solve this problem by writing books
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.440]   where we put in all these caveats about like,
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.160]   well, I'm not saying that you shouldn't use your phone
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.480]   and please don't yell at me,
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.980]   but like, you know, maybe if you're able,
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.760]   you should consider like putting down your phone
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.540]   while you're having dinner, you know,
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.280]   but unless like you really need your phone during dinner,
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.940]   that's not what's going to solve this problem.
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.120]   We need to fundamentally repair our relationship
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.020]   with these tools.
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.040]   We need a philosophy, well thought through
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.560]   about how technology is integrated into our lives.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.640]   And the philosophy I preach is digital minimalism
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.040]   from my book, eponymously titled "Digital Minimalism."
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.560]   And it's a pretty simple approach.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.300]   It says, what you need to do is figure out
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.680]   what you care about in your life, the positive,
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.680]   what you want to spend time doing.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.780]   You then work backwards and say,
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.380]   for each of these things I care about,
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.120]   what's a really useful way or effective way
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.920]   to use technology to support it?
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.400]   Your answer to those questions
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.920]   describes the technologies you use.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.520]   Everything else you don't use.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.160]   For something to lay claim to your time and attention,
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.880]   it has to go through the test of, I care about this,
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.040]   this technology is the best way to support this.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.640]   And here are the specific rules I use
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.360]   for using this technology to support this thing
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.480]   I care about.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.040]   Everything else by default, you do not use in your life.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.380]   It allows you to leverage the power of technology
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.040]   without being a slave to their worst excesses.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.440]   That's where you need to get into.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.240]   You need to establish your own philosophy
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.120]   of digital minimalism.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.060]   You don't just need tips to nibble at the edges
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.720]   of excessive phone use.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.640]   But I know tips help people.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.520]   So let me give you a few warmup rules
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.960]   that will prepare you for going through
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.720]   a bigger digital minimalism type transition.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.160]   These are rules that real digital minimalists
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.040]   have come up with as they've gone through this exercise
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.540]   of reshaping their relationship to technology.
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.620]   Number one, the phone foyer method.
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.320]   I see this a lot.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.640]   I see this a lot among minimalists who really think through
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.000]   how do I wanna use tech?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.780]   When you are at home, the phone goes on a shelf
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.360]   in the kitchen or in your foyer, it's plugged into charge.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.400]   That's where it is.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.200]   If you're expecting a call, put the ringer on.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.340]   If it rings, you can go in there and answer the call.
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.620]   If there's text messages you might need to check in on,
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.420]   you can walk to the foyer or the kitchen,
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.120]   that phone stays plugged in,
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.080]   and you can answer those text messages right there.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.600]   It is not with you elsewhere in your house.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.240]   So it's not with you when you're watching TV.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.920]   If you wanna go see if someone texted you,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.940]   you gotta walk over there and stand there at the foyer,
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.160]   typing until you're done with that.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.040]   If you wanna look something up,
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.460]   you have to walk over to the foyer, look it up,
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.320]   type it in, and then go back to what you're doing.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.880]   It's not with you at the dinner table.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.640]   It's for sure not with you in the bedroom.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.520]   So that's an example of a rule around use
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.360]   that might emerge as you do a digital minimalism
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.860]   overhaul to your life.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.740]   Another rule that I think is interesting
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.240]   that's emerged often among digital minimalists
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.080]   is purposefully engineered disconnected time
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.960]   every single day.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.520]   Every single day I'm going for a walk
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.700]   or running an errand without a phone.
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.960]   And if I'm bored, I'm bored.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.840]   And if emergency happens, an emergency happens.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.200]   But you know what?
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.480]   Until like a minute ago,
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.580]   we did not have phones with us everywhere we went,
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.160]   and the vast majority of us did not die
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.120]   in tragic emergencies
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.160]   'cause we were unable to quickly text someone.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.040]   So you might wanna try those as a warm-up, Nanded.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.480]   Phone for your method,
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.960]   significant expedition or time every day without your phone
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.680]   just to get used to what it's like not to be with it.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.520]   That's a good warmup,
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.280]   but you need to do the full transformation.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.080]   My book "Digital Minimalism" is a good place to start.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.920]   That book is available in lots of different countries.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.000]   I think we've sold rights on that
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.080]   to a lot of different places.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.000]   So wherever you're from,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.880]   you can probably find a copy of that book.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.040]   (upbeat music)
