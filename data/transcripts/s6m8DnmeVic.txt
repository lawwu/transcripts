[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   Our first one is a written question.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.760]   This comes from Colin.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.960]   Colin says there, there always seems to be more to be done.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.900]   How do you stop yourself from losing faith in your system?
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.700]   It's like painting the fourth bridge.
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.000]   Once you finish, you just go back to the beginning and start all over again.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   So I don't know the fourth bridge reference, but I've heard that
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.100]   saying with the golden gate.
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.500]   Bridge by the time they're finished painting the golden gate bridge, they have to.
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.600]   Go back and I like this question a lot.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.400]   Repainted again.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.400]   Now, Jesse, do you think he's talking about, I want to make sure I'm
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.400]   interpreting it properly.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.500]   Did you think he's talking about just, there's always more goals or projects
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.100]   or tasks to do, and it's sort of Sisyphean you, no matter how many things
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.700]   you get done, there's always more things to get done.
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.800]   That's what I think he's saying.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.100]   Right.
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.400]   Okay.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.900]   Not that you're always, there's always tweaks to do to your system.
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.300]   I think it's the first situation.
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.500]   Yeah.
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.100]   Well, you know, Colin, that's it's a, it's a good point.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.900]   So here's the issue.
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:10.400]   Um, you don't want an oppositional mindset towards the activities or
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.100]   tasks or projects in your life.
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.200]   You do not want to have a mindset of, I have to get through these things.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.000]   Until I can get to where I want to get, which is, I don't know, having nothing
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.700]   to do or having free time that my, my task list, my projects, my goals, my
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.500]   task list, my projects, my plans are somehow an obstacle to some other better
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.200]   state that if you could just get through these things as fast as possible, you
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.700]   could get to that better state.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.100]   I'm going to suggest a alternative mindset, which is that man is always in
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.000]   action, activity is fundamental to life.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.200]   Our bodies taken food and water and convert it into energy so that we can
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.600]   actually create movement.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.900]   We can actually create action in the world.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.000]   So the goal of a time management system or productivity system and a life
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   structuring system, the various types of things I talk about is making sure
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.600]   that the action that you're doing, because you're going to be doing action
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.600]   one way or the other is as meaningful and directed as possible.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.000]   We could think about this.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.900]   If we wanted to biochemically, there's a certain amount of calories you're
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.500]   taking in each day.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.600]   That's going to be converted into energy.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.300]   That energy then allows you to do things like think and move.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.100]   Taking those calories, you're going to create that energy every day.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.300]   There's a certain amount of energy you are burning through.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.000]   So the question is, what do you want to get in return for that energy?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.900]   And so thinking about interesting or meaningful things or things that are
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.400]   useful to the world, being, being a leader, being effective, being good to
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   others, all of these type of positive targets for your energy is good.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.000]   You're going to burn it one way or the other.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.200]   You want to direct it towards the thing that's going to make life meaningful.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.100]   That's going to make life useful.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.400]   So we're wired for that calling.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.900]   We're wired for action.
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.600]   Your goal is just to direct that action.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.100]   It's nice to take a break now and again, but I can tell you if I could take
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.500]   everything off your list, every task, every project, bring in a whole staff
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   to take care of your every need, you could just sit there.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.700]   There's the hammock will bring you food, will bring you water.
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.700]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.300]   You're not going to be happy.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.400]   And the reason why you're not going to be happy is that our mind does not
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.500]   expect life to be like that for any extended period of time.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.300]   Action is fundamental to the human experience.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.400]   It's your job to try to make that action as useful as possible.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.600]   So the bridge needs to be painted because otherwise it rust.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.700]   So keep painting.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.300]   Thank you.
