[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   There it is, there's Lex.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.300]   Oh.
[00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.300]   [Lex's Podcast theme plays]
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.800]   [Chuckling]
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.100]   That's pretty good.
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.100]   Lex can shred.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.300]   Give me some of that.
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.300]   [Chuckling]
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.100]   You gotta listen to this.
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.100]   Listen to this.
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:26.100]   [Lex's Podcast theme plays]
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.600]   Have you done Lex's podcast?
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.600]   No.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.100]   You would love him.
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.600]   He's an AI researcher.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.600]   Uh-huh.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.600]   From MIT originally, and now he's mostly doing independent work and doing his own podcast.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600]   And brilliant, brilliant guy.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.600]   You would love him.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.100]   Mm-hmm.
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.100]   And he's got an amazing podcast too.
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.100]   Okay, so here, it's gonna be in this section here.
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.100]   I don't think you're interested in Lex's podcast.
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.600]   Seems like he's not paying attention.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.100]   What do you mean? No, hang on.
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.100]   [Chuckling]
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.100]   I got this.
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.600]   Lex--
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.600]   No, thank you for the tip!
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.100]   I'm trying to get him on, buddy.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.600]   Trying to get him in.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.600]   Lex actually is one of the most brilliant people I know.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.100]   I think you would love talking to him.
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.600]   Uh...
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.100]   We have an interesting quote here from Walter Badshott.
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.600]   "One of the greatest pains to human nature is the pain of a new idea."
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.100]   Really?
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.600]   That guy's an idiot.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.600]   [Chuckling]
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.600]   That's not the greatest pain.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.600]   Someone needs to kick him in the nuts.
