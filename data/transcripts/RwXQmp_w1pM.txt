[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.840]   - Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.720]   This episode was hosted by the Pre and Early Retirement
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.120]   Life Stage Chapter and recorded April 6th, 2022.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.880]   The topic was Documenting Financial Information
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.080]   for Surviving Spouse or Executor.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.820]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy
[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.260]   for attaining financial independence.

[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.880]   advice.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.680]   - This meeting is for informational purposes only,
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.880]   should not be construed as personalized investing advice.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.040]   And it's also not legal advice.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.880]   And we're not telling you,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.320]   oh, you should do something this way.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.720]   We're just presenting you with a pretty long list of things
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.600]   that you should go back, consider.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.680]   This is gonna take, it's a lot of things to consider.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.320]   It's gonna take you a while.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.040]   Think about how you wanna do this.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.440]   How do you wanna document this for your,
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.860]   so what this meeting is,
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.520]   it's a lot of times in the Bogleheads world,
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.360]   especially there's one partner, spouse, person,
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.880]   in particular that handles a lot of the finances,
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.800]   not all the time.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.320]   Sometimes one person handles investing,
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.080]   one person handles bill paying.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.200]   Sometimes one person handles everything.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.360]   So you wanna make sure if you were to unfortunately
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.800]   pass away, you wanna make sure that the surviving spouse
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.740]   knows where to find accounts, all your assets,
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.300]   and we're gonna go over all this passwords,
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.860]   things like that, important documents in your house.
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.700]   So basically what this presentation is, discussion is,
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.760]   is what you can do ahead of time
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.300]   to make things easier for your surviving spouse.
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.460]   And when I say that, it's also gonna apply in situations
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.740]   where you become incapacitated and you, a power of attorney,
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.220]   it's also useful in that situation
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.540]   where the power of attorney is gonna take over.
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.620]   And to a certain extent, when you're the last spouse to die
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.620]   and your executor has to take over,
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.940]   but it's mostly geared towards the surviving spouse
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.100]   or power of attorney.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.900]   So we're not gonna tell you,
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.940]   this is how you should do something.
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.300]   We're gonna present some options
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.140]   and you're gonna go back, do your own research,
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.580]   think about it, make your own decisions.
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.580]   And also we wanna be a little bit, oh, sorry, careful to,
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.140]   especially with things like passwords,
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.380]   if you're not the surviving spouse,
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.900]   you wanna be real careful
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.820]   about when you're gonna use that information to log in.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.980]   You don't wanna go start making transactions.
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.940]   You wanna, we're gonna say,
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.980]   take care and consult an estate attorney
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.700]   before taking any kind of action like that.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.220]   And then also this is by no means a complete list
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.860]   of what needs to be done after death.
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.140]   Although we are gonna mention a lot of things,
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.540]   it's mostly, like I said before,
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.820]   to prepare in advance before you die
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.340]   to make things easier for your spouse.
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.940]   So it's not really like a complete list
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.820]   of everything that the spouses should be doing
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.820]   after your death.
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.340]   Okay.
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.340]   Okay, so the first thing is things you can do now
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.860]   to make things easier later.
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.660]   So the main thing you wanna make sure
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.700]   all your estate planning documents are in order,
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.660]   that includes your will, your power of attorney.
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.820]   There's a medical, there's a financial, medical directives.
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.060]   There's probably seven or 10 different documents.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.020]   And if you visit an estate planning attorney,
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.100]   they will have a whole packet of documents
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.100]   for you to fill out.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.260]   And you wanna make sure all of your accounts
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.940]   are titled the way you want,
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.220]   and that will work in conjunction with your will.
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.780]   And if you have a trust set up,
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.500]   you may have to read title things in the name of the trust,
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.180]   and you just wanna check all of your accounts,
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.420]   including your 401ks, your bank accounts,
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.900]   your insurance, all that kind of thing.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.740]   And then also check all your beneficiary areas,
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.660]   as well as the contingent beneficiaries.
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.660]   Everywhere you have an account
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.500]   that has a transfer on death, payable on death,
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.980]   bank accounts, brokerage accounts, insurance policies,
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.860]   you wanna check all of those.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.700]   The other thing you can do is you can simplify
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.380]   and consolidate accounts when possible.
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.660]   I know I need to do that.
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.420]   Somehow my husband and I both ended up
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.380]   with like literally three or four different Roth IRAs
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.500]   here and there, and there's no reason why
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.660]   they can't be kind of consolidated.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.580]   That'll just eliminate or reduce
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.820]   the number of actual accounts,
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.780]   which will just make things a lot easier.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.500]   A large part of this discussion is gonna be,
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.500]   we're gonna call it a book or a binder,
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.860]   and I'm just gonna start calling it the book.
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.060]   And it's gonna have a lot of documentation
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.140]   that you're gonna leave for your surviving spouse,
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.380]   and we're gonna, that's what the rest of the discussion
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.700]   is gonna be about.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.700]   And then also, once you create this book,
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.380]   you wanna kind of go over it with your spouse,
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.980]   let them know where is the book, what's in the book,
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.740]   and then should you pass away,
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.620]   they'll immediately know, oh, I need to go to the book,
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.900]   and it's gonna have a lot of information
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.340]   that's gonna be very helpful.
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.060]   One other thing I've heard people suggest
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.420]   is if you've been managing your own investments
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.780]   and you think your spouse is the type
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.020]   that probably is not gonna wanna,
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.260]   either not gonna want to,
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.420]   or not have any interest in managing,
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.460]   you may want to leave the name
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.860]   of a trusted friend or relative,
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.820]   or some people actually pre-select a financial advisor,
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.420]   even if you don't already have one now,
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.940]   they're gonna say, okay,
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.140]   if you decide you want a financial advisor,
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.700]   I recommend this person make a list of two or three
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.660]   that you would recommend, of course,
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.100]   that are low fee and fiduciary and whatever you choose.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.420]   One thing that I've heard of
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.820]   is you should establish separate credit cards
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.140]   in each spouse's name alone.
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.900]   It used to be you could have a joint account.
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.540]   I hear that they're going away from that,
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.940]   and you can have a primary person on the account
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.340]   and an authorized user,
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.500]   but I've heard of situations where when a person dies,
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.180]   those credit cards are just gonna get shut down,
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.780]   even if you're an authorized user,
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.300]   and you could be left with no credit cards.
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.740]   So that's definitely something you wanna think about
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.100]   is establishing at least one,
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.180]   preferably, Clark Howard always says
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.580]   you should have two or three accounts,
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.740]   which is true 'cause my accounts are constantly,
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.980]   oh, we detected some fraud.
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.940]   We're gonna shut this down.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.220]   You don't wanna be left without a card.
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.940]   So ideally, each spouse should have two in there,
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.300]   which is kind of a pain 'cause to keep them active,
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.700]   you gotta do some charges,
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.500]   and then you gotta pay for credit card.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.620]   That's what I do, pay for credit card bills every month,
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.340]   but in the end, that's gonna work out, I think.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.020]   You wanna make sure there's gonna be some cash available
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.980]   to pay for immediate expenses, particularly funeral bills.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.100]   If there's a house, obviously,
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.620]   household bills, that kind of thing.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.980]   And there's several different ways to do that.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.260]   Obviously, if it's a joint account,
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.500]   it's not gonna be a problem,
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.380]   but if it's not a joint account,
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.660]   you could consider leaving life insurance to somebody,
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.460]   adding somebody as a cosigner,
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.180]   putting somebody right away as a transfer on death,
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.540]   payable on death, and those bypass probate
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.260]   immediately go to that person.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.500]   Of course, you have to trust that person
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.340]   to be able to use that money to pay your bills.
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.780]   There's an issue about the safe deposit box.
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.380]   I worked as a probate paralegal for a while,
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.620]   and we had cases where the person's will,
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.900]   either they thought there was a will,
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.580]   or there was a will in the safe deposit box,
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.420]   but nobody had the key,
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.180]   so you actually have to get a court order
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.980]   to drill open the box or whatever.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.820]   Even if you had the key,
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.980]   you had to get a court order to open the box,
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.940]   if the person's name,
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.580]   if nobody else's name was on the box,
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.060]   so you wanna consider making sure your spouse is on there.
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.540]   And we actually put my adult daughter on ours
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.500]   to just make things easier later on.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.060]   Of course, you always wanna declutter
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.300]   your paperwork in your house,
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.260]   'cause if not, somebody's gonna have to do that
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.620]   after you're gone.
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.140]   Consider purchasing cemetery plots and headstones.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.460]   My parents went as far as purchased their own headstones.
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.100]   They had everything engraved except the date.
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.820]   It's installed, it's ready to go,
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.380]   and they're still doing great,
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.660]   but they wanna make things easier,
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.460]   so they had that done ahead of time.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.780]   If you have an HSA, especially with the large balance,
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.660]   you wanna consider whether or not you wanna leave a balance
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.260]   or you wanna start spending that down
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.460]   as you get, you never know what's gonna happen,
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.460]   but you wanna consider what's gonna happen with your HSA.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.980]   And then you wanna review the book that you make.
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.740]   You wanna review it annually and update as needed.
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.140]   So does anybody have any kind of comments
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.780]   on what they did to handle any of this kind of,
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.780]   what you can be doing now to make things easier later?
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.060]   Just feel free to, oh, Jim,
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.500]   I forgot to do your little Zoom tips,
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.380]   but hopefully people know how to click
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.380]   on the raised hand icon to raise their hand.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.660]   Go ahead, Lady Geek.
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.620]   - Yeah, okay, a couple of things.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.020]   First, save your chat on the Zoom thing.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.900]   I will be saving it and posting it in an anonymized version
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.420]   with nobody's names in it once tomorrow or next day
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.700]   to make that available.
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.660]   One thing, let me back up a little bit
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.180]   and give a bigger picture here.
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.700]   We're talking about power of attorney.
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.780]   Power of attorney only exists while that person is alive.
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.380]   Once that person passes,
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.020]   all power of attorneys cease
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.620]   to have any authority whatsoever.
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.420]   It becomes part of the decedent's estate.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.580]   So when people are clear about power of attorney,
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.420]   be very sure you understand that fact that POA just stops.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.460]   You have no authority after the person dies
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.820]   with that document.
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.220]   A couple of minor things is that
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.260]   if you want power of attorney for a bank,
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.660]   all you need to do is take that person with you
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.540]   into the bank, say,
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.860]   "I'm gonna give this person power of attorney."
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.700]   They'll sign a form and have a small discussion.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.900]   Five minutes later, you have POA on that account.
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.180]   That is a very big thing.
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.340]   It's a very big financial help to have POA
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.780]   when the person starts to get near death
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.700]   and becomes unable to have cognitive understanding
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.540]   of things going on.
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.060]   You can step in as POA with the bank immediately.
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.740]   In fact, I'm doing that while I have POA.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.220]   In fact, POA is good before they pass
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.260]   because they say there's that big area
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.460]   where they're not quite passed away.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.380]   They're on their way.
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.860]   They have a medical condition
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.620]   and you need that power of attorney while they're alive.
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.540]   I'm actually doing that for my mom right now
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.820]   because she has some issues
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.180]   and I just signed a legal contract on her behalf
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.620]   to have an aide be with her in her assisted living.
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.180]   That needs to be a legal contract.
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.220]   They need access to the bank account to do ACH transfer.
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.620]   So welcome to that.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.900]   But I did all of that under POA, fully legal.
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:40.180]   Also upon death,
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.620]   as soon as you take everything to the funeral director,
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.980]   the funeral director is required
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.380]   to notify social security of the death.
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.580]   This is for fraud prevention.
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.820]   So once the funeral director files a form,
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.980]   every financial institution is notified.
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.820]   So if they decide, if they notice that,
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.500]   they will lock that account.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.100]   Usually what you do is you call in and say,
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.340]   "Hey, somebody died and they want the copy
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.580]   "of their death certificate."
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.980]   But in the meantime, they already know.
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.260]   So you might as well be forthcoming about it
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.540]   and do whatever you need to do
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.380]   before you get to the funeral director.
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.820]   The funeral director gets it.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.580]   Let's see.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.060]   Oh, the other thing I wanted to mention
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.740]   is if you're gonna do websites,
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.020]   FidSafe.com, I'll put the link in the chat.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.900]   Because people who designate as trusted people,
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.420]   they have to know where the documents are
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.540]   before the person passes.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.740]   FidSafe.com, I know a lot of some people do that.
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.980]   I'm kind of delinquent on signing up myself.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.100]   It's run by Fidelity,
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.220]   but you do not have to have a Fidelity account.
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.980]   It is designed for beneficiaries
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.180]   to be active after the person passes.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.300]   So you put everything you want up in that site,
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.300]   it will be securely stored online with them.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.820]   So I think I've covered enough.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.260]   They say, "Oh, consider purchasing
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.180]   "cemetery plots and headstones."
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.300]   Bear in mind, the funeral director,
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.380]   if you pay a price and the price increases,
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.900]   I hear that they can charge for the difference.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.660]   So, okay, I'll stop on that.
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.700]   - Okay, Joe, go ahead.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.500]   You've got your hand raised, Joe?
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:23.340]   - Oh, sorry, took me a second to unmute.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.340]   - Oh, okay.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.620]   - Lots of great ideas.
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.020]   What I do, one tool that really worked for me
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.260]   is Quicken, not Quicken, no, Willmaker.
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:39.260]   Has a great form for recording all this kind of information
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:45.620]   and things that you would not have thought about,
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.260]   like your Amazon library, if you're a Kindle reader.
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:55.260]   So I found that alone worth the price of Willmaker.
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:00.020]   And I use that quite a bit.
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:06.260]   The other thing that I do is I do more electronic forms
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.140]   rather than a binder.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.500]   Because a binder is not as safe or secure.
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.060]   But I do make sure that my wife is able to access the,
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.540]   it's on my computer, it's on thumb drives.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:28.420]   You can take an image that's encrypted in AES 1024
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.940]   and leave it in a Dropbox.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.860]   So my daughter has access to that as well.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.420]   And that's updated at least once a year.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:44.420]   So I find doing it electronically a lot more efficient,
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.340]   especially because my book would be probably 300 pages.
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:54.820]   And I had a weird thing happen.
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.740]   I was perusing YouTube and there was a little video
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.140]   on how to break into the safe that we bought.
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.140]   So those of you who have like a Sentry safe
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.900]   or buy one from Home Depot or Costco,
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.500]   one of the lower end safes,
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.020]   it's really good for fireproof,
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.820]   but he was able to break it in one and a half seconds.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:22.900]   And it's pretty amazing how easy the safes are to break in.
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:28.100]   Given that book is your whole finances,
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.220]   I didn't feel comfortable just having it all printed out.
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.140]   So that's my little bit.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.660]   - Right.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.580]   Yeah, I think it's totally up to everybody
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.420]   how they wanna do it.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.340]   And it's also based on like,
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.860]   I don't think my mom would be able to figure out how to,
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.900]   like she'll type an email and I'll call my dad,
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.220]   would you send the email?
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.940]   I don't think, but anyway,
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.180]   so it's all dependent on how comfortable you feel.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.020]   And like you said, yeah,
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.820]   you don't want to put it right out in open
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.020]   where a robber burglar would come in like,
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.620]   oh, there's their, so it's all up to you
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.580]   and how you think Miriam, go ahead.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.700]   What do you have to add?
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.540]   - Yes.
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.700]   One thing about the power of attorney
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:14.300]   that many have found that the banks will not accept,
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.820]   many banks will not accept a regular power of attorney
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.140]   that is drafted by an attorney.
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.780]   And even if it's notarized and signed,
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.940]   and I think that Vanguard does not,
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.180]   they want you to use their own power of attorney forms.
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:34.180]   And with Vanguard, the form is the full agent authority form
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.940]   and you can also have limited agent.
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.940]   But if you have that with Vanguard
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.580]   or the similar with Fidelity and the other bank,
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.380]   your other investing companies,
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.700]   then you can just, it's easier to get in at that time.
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.940]   It's not, you don't have to deal with them
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.220]   not accepting the power of attorney.
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.820]   And I know that in Florida now they have a clause
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.300]   that is put into the power of attorney form that says,
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.860]   banks, if you don't accept this,
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.820]   then we're going to get really mad
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.660]   and you're going to pay the price.
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.700]   But whether this really works or not,
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.060]   and who wants to take the chance,
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.260]   just go to the bank
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.660]   and get your own power of attorney with the bank.
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.540]   - Okay, very good.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.980]   Thank you, Miriam.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.820]   Keith, go ahead.
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.260]   - Yes, good evening, everyone.
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:29.260]   I was just, had recently gone through this with my mother
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.500]   and a lot of great information on here.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.820]   Maybe just a couple of things
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:38.340]   that I would want to emphasize based on our experience
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.740]   is bring, if you're going to bring somebody in,
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.340]   whether it's a child or a trusted friend,
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.740]   bring them in early,
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.020]   at least so they know where everything is at,
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.420]   whether it's in a safe, whether it's online,
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.620]   whether it's printed out and saved somewhere.
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.380]   So they're aware of where things are.
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.780]   My parents passed away about four years apart,
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:07.780]   but mentally their progression or regression
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.100]   happened at different paces.
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:15.060]   And so, one spouse, one half might think,
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.500]   I'll give all the information to the other,
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.180]   to my spouse and they'll be able to take care of it
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.020]   when they go.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.340]   And then a few years later,
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.580]   it turns out that that other spouse might be
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:28.020]   progressing with something
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.220]   where their mental sharpness is going away
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.580]   and starts to forget things.
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.700]   So I would suggest starting earlier rather than later.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.380]   Based on our experience,
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.860]   my brother and I are both redoing our estate plans.
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:45.060]   We're putting together the binder with documentation
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.220]   and where things are at, account numbers,
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:53.100]   passwords, 800 numbers, things like that.
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.660]   Because when my father did it with us
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.780]   and then he passed shortly after,
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.780]   then we had about four years where we were
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.020]   in charge of our mother's financial affairs.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.340]   And if our father had not reviewed those things with us,
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.500]   we would not know where things are at.
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.220]   We would not have been able to find,
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.220]   whether it's tax returns,
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.060]   other information that we needed,
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.540]   insurance policies that we needed to include
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.660]   with the claim form.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.300]   So I would suggest doing earlier rather than later.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.340]   And you can always update it as you go,
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.220]   if something changes,
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.020]   but do it while you're younger and sharper, if you can,
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.260]   so that it's as accurate as possible.
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.620]   And then just go in maybe once a year and update it.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.180]   And I will also say on the cemetery plots,
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.820]   my parents were both planners.
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.540]   They literally bought their headstones
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.940]   and their headstone and their plot,
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.100]   probably close to 30 years ago and they prepaid it.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.620]   So when I walked in to do this with the cemetery,
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.620]   he looked at me and he said,
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.980]   "Wow," he goes, "Your parents were really smart.
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.100]   "It would probably be three times what they paid
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.260]   "if you had to pay today's prices."
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.900]   And that's a significant sum
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.460]   that we did not have to pay out from the estate.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:15.380]   So it is a smart thing to think about that ahead of time.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.500]   Some people don't like to do that,
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.540]   but if you're thinking about who you're giving the money to
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.620]   and what you're giving and how much,
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.460]   it's smart to prepay ahead of time
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.620]   so that they don't have to worry about that.
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.620]   And if there's a significant increase in price,
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.500]   it's already been locked in.
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.540]   Thank you.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.660]   - Very good, thank you, Keith.
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.540]   Henry, go ahead.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:41.820]   - Yeah, so it's really important for anybody
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:46.220]   who moves from one state to another
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:51.220]   that the laws with all of these estate planning documents
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.420]   are really state-specific.
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.220]   And in terms of how many witnesses you need,
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.700]   how it has to be notarized,
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.780]   if there are certain magic phrases
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.900]   that the state wants to be in there
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.900]   to have it be honored when the time comes.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.300]   And even if there are ways to kind of do workarounds,
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.500]   you don't want to be having to mess with this
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.500]   in circumstances where the documents
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.740]   are actually being applied.
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:25.300]   So it's something that you may have all your documents
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.620]   and you're all set and you may figure,
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.700]   well, everything's good,
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.740]   whether we're in the state where it was done
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.180]   or where you're moving to,
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.900]   but it's just something you want to check out.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.500]   - Thank you, Henry.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.140]   Jim, go ahead.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.140]   - I just wanted to say something that Keith mentioned.
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.340]   Besides the planning of that cemetery plots
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.900]   or whatever the issues are,
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.100]   I think it relieves the family of anguish
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.860]   of what mom would have wanted
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.980]   or what dad would have wanted or whatever,
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.100]   and it may even save a family fight.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.980]   So anyway, that's all I'm gonna say.
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:58.820]   - Right, right.
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.540]   Okay, we're gonna go to the next slide.
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.740]   Oh, there it is.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.780]   Okay, so this is all talking about the book,
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.100]   whether it be a paper book or online,
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.940]   or it could be both.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.940]   Like, what I do is I type it online,
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.100]   I mean, on my computer,
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.340]   and then I print it out and put it in the file cabinet
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.140]   with the little color sticky.
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.460]   Okay, so I'm just gonna let you know ahead of time
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.980]   what the different categories are gonna be.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.260]   Location of, you know,
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.900]   sometimes you need the original document
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.460]   or you need to know where it is
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.780]   as far as a document or a key.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.180]   So we have a list of those.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.020]   Kind of a discussion on passwords, codes,
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.500]   which can go a lot of different ways.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.620]   What to do first in the, you know,
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.500]   what your spouse should,
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.980]   or your surviving spouse should do first
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.180]   in the event of death.
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.660]   Content, you want to list all the contact info
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.700]   for professionals.
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.580]   Of course, a big category is listing
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.740]   all your investment financial accounts,
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.100]   your insurance information.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.740]   Another big category is paying,
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.100]   you want to make sure all the bills get paid,
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.300]   tax returns, and then some kind of household
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.380]   and miscellaneous.
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.220]   So we're gonna go ahead and just start on those.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.660]   So that's basically your table of contents for your,
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.300]   or suggested table of contents for books.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.660]   Okay, so like I said, this is not,
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.860]   you don't necessarily put the original documents
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:10.700]   in the book.
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.780]   You can, or you just say, you know,
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.820]   where they are.
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.620]   Like, here's where my passport is.
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.460]   Here's where my social security card is.
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.180]   So of course you want,
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.220]   very important is all your state planning documents.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.020]   And in Texas, we have something called
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.260]   a memorandum of wishes that is referenced by the will.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.100]   And what that is,
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.660]   it's a list of something that could,
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.380]   like all your little, your dishes, your silverware,
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.940]   your kind of sentimental items
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.660]   that might not be of huge value.
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.340]   And that, you don't want to put that right in the will
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.780]   'cause that could change pretty often.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.660]   You don't want to be changing your will very often.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.500]   So you want to put, if you have something like that,
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.020]   you want to keep that with your original will.
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:59.940]   And there's different trains of thought
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.540]   on where you should keep your will.
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.820]   My boss, I said I was a paralegal
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.780]   for an estate planning attorney.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:09.260]   He said, put it in a plastic bag and put it in your freezer
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.420]   because that's the last thing
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.700]   that's going to get burned in a fire.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.180]   Or put it in a safe.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.420]   You can, some people put it in their safe deposit box,
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.180]   but then there's the issue of getting into it.
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.820]   Once you pass, you might be able to get into it.
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:22.660]   So there's, you know,
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.660]   there's kind of different trains of thought
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.340]   on where you should store your original will,
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.620]   but wherever you do,
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.020]   let somebody know, document in this book where it is.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.780]   Of course, copies of any trust, if you have those,
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.140]   you know, where your passports are,
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.660]   where your original social security cards,
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.620]   original birth certificates, marriage certificates,
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.100]   divorce decrees, your original Medicare,
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.780]   medical insurance cards.
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.140]   Very important, your safe deposit box keys,
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.380]   because of course, if you lose those,
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.940]   they have to like drill it out.
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.540]   Or so I've heard, it's kind of a big hassle.
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.500]   And now lately, last couple of times I went,
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.420]   they have a pin.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.380]   You have to have a pin number
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.940]   to go with your safe deposit box.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.180]   The actual original vehicle titles are helpful to have.
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.220]   They can always get replacements,
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.260]   but it's helpful to have the originals.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.740]   If you have extra car keys,
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.740]   nowadays the car keys cost literally, what?
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:13.380]   $200 to have a keypad made or whatever.
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.740]   So you want to note the extras of those.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.220]   House, garage, car, garage keys, mailbox keys.
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.940]   And some people still have paper savings bonds.
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.660]   If those are not, you know,
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.020]   you may have a safe deposit box,
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.500]   or you may just have them store away.
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.060]   You definitely want to document where those are.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:36.060]   So this is kind of a list of originals of something,
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.420]   or little keys that need to be kept track of.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.380]   Does anybody have anything that they can add to that?
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.740]   Henry, is your hand up from last time,
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.460]   or do you have something for this?
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.780]   Jim, go ahead.
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.420]   - That has something.
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.780]   - Sorry, I'll take my hand down, sorry.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.780]   - Okay, I'm sorry, I don't know your name.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.620]   PJ.
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.660]   - P-A-T.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.220]   - Okay, go ahead.
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:04.460]   - There's an electronic binder of this stuff
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.060]   that you can get from online.
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.300]   I posted it in the chat where the website is.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.260]   - Great.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.060]   - And it's like $25 or so,
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.300]   but it goes through a lot of these things,
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.300]   gives you guidance and whatnot to store,
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:26.300]   and it lets your successors know what you want it to do.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.140]   - Great, thank you for that suggestion.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.020]   Joel?
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:35.380]   - Yeah, just all the originals
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.980]   that you were talking about are great.
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.620]   My only thought would be make sure you can scan
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.220]   as much of it as you can.
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.060]   - Good idea.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.500]   - At a time as well.
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.340]   - Yes.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.700]   And just in case you can't look at the originals,
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.540]   then you have a few.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.380]   Does it have a copy?
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.020]   It's better than nothing, right.
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.460]   Miriam?
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.140]   - Yes, this is a story from a friend of ours.
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.900]   When his father passed away,
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.340]   he and his brother were going through everything,
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.100]   and they were going through his file cabinets.
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.180]   His father was a lawyer and had all these file cabinets,
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.500]   and they were going through file cabinets in the house,
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.660]   and they had all the kids going through the file cabinets
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.660]   in the house, looking for things.
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.380]   And they came across a lot of these files
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.740]   that had been in the house for a long time.
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.780]   And they were looking for things.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:26.780]   And they came across some very beautiful pieces of paper
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:31.940]   that were actual original stock certificates.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.260]   Before the days when you were with Merrill Lynch
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.780]   or a brokerage, and the brokerage company held the stock,
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:43.500]   that the father had actually original stock certificates.
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.220]   And that's all they were.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.140]   And they were in the file cabins,
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.620]   and they were worth quite a bit of money.
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.780]   Our friend had said, "What if they had just tossed them out
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.140]   and not looked at what they were?"
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.580]   Now I'm not saying everybody would have
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.260]   original stock certificates,
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.620]   but your parents may have things you don't know they have.
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.540]   - Very true, very true.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.820]   PJ, your hand is still up.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:08.940]   Do you have anything to add or?
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:09.780]   Okay.
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:14.180]   Okay, we're gonna go to the next slide.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.860]   Okay, this is a big area.
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.820]   And like I said, I don't wanna give advice
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:20.660]   on what you should do
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.860]   'cause there's different ways to handle things.
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.340]   So I have a disclaimer here.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:29.420]   Obviously you wanna have your passwords documented.
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.860]   Like Lady Geek was saying for your power of attorney,
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.900]   if you're incapacitated, they do have authority
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.380]   to, I believe, log into your accounts
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.020]   and handle your accounts for you.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.140]   And in a lot of cases, your surviving spouse
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:44.180]   is also on the account and would have authority to log in.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.940]   But other than that, if somebody passes away,
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:46.780]   we don't wanna worry about it.
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.060]   We wanna be really careful about using passwords
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.620]   to log into the account.
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:55.020]   We wanna say, check with your estate probate attorney
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:55.980]   before you do that.
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:01.580]   So that said, there's many different ways to handle.
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:02.540]   You could just hand...
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.180]   One time we had somebody in my job as a paralegal.
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.700]   We had somebody die, we went in their house
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.980]   and they just had right on their desk,
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.620]   they had this handwritten list.
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.100]   Well, actually it was printed out list of passwords
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.900]   and accounts, but then a lot of things
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.740]   were like scratched through
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.380]   and they changed the password a bunch of times
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.380]   and scratched through.
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.780]   So someone that worked.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.580]   You could keep it in a computer file.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.940]   You could use a password manager.
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.660]   And I haven't used it myself, but I hear my dad uses one.
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.660]   I hear there's like LastPass, Dashlane,
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.340]   1Password, Bitwarden, and those are,
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.940]   from what I understand, they're very secure
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:37.940]   and they're very, very helpful
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.500]   'cause you just have to remember one password
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.780]   and then all the rest of your passwords are very, very secure.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.020]   Like Lady, you mentioned earlier, there's FidSafe.
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.020]   I haven't used it myself,
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.620]   but it's a free service from Fidelity
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.180]   to securely store documents.
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.940]   If you wanna create this book binder online
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.540]   and then be able to store it with some trusted people,
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.860]   your children or other people like that.
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.980]   You can also give specific documents
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.620]   to only certain people.
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.740]   And you can also, I don't know how you do this exactly,
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.580]   but you can grant access to somebody after your death.
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.220]   Now, also there's the whole issue
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.300]   of secret questions and answers.
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.220]   That could be also another sticky situation
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.300]   where you don't really wanna be careful
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.220]   who you give that out to,
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.140]   but it might be helpful in some cases.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.300]   And then there's also the issue of,
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.060]   I found a thread on this on Bogleheads,
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.100]   two-factor authentication where they send some code
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.260]   to your email or your cell phone.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:35.180]   So you may wanna include your swiping pattern
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.980]   or your code or whatever to get into your cell phone
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.860]   in case that's helpful.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.500]   There's also, you can also have,
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.500]   make sure you're surviving a spouse.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.580]   Like for, say, for example,
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.860]   your Vanguard or your Fidelity account,
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.460]   you can also, of course, access the joint accounts,
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.380]   but you can also set,
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:58.740]   make sure that your spouse has their own login
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.820]   to a lot of the accounts.
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:02.220]   You can have a whole separate login
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.100]   where they have their own set of passwords
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.940]   and that way they don't have to use yours.
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.260]   That's just one option.
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.780]   There's other household passwords.
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.060]   There's wifi password, garage code, home security code,
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.420]   home safe combination,
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:19.020]   and it's kind of up to you how you wanna handle that.
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.460]   But these are all just things to think about.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:26.460]   And one thing I do is I have kind of two passwords.
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.820]   I have like a base password
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.020]   where I have one that's used
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.500]   for just whatever I don't care about.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.460]   It's my, some account that I don't care about.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.180]   And then I have one that's for financial.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.060]   And then what I do is for each account,
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.340]   I add a bunch of like some characters at the end,
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.900]   like pound 62.
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.060]   So in my document,
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.860]   I don't actually have the actual password.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.260]   I say it's my financial password plus pound 62.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.700]   And then when I print out the document,
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.500]   that's when I write on the actual, like the base password.
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.100]   I mean, that's one way to do it.
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.060]   Another way to do it is to like,
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.300]   say you have your very important password manager password,
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.980]   you could give half to one of your relatives
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.220]   and give the other half to the other one and say,
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.020]   in the event of my death,
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.980]   you can get together and you'll have a whole password
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.220]   or something like that.
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.340]   There's many different ways to handle things,
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.580]   but these are just all things to think about.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.380]   Does anybody have any input
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.220]   on how they handle their passwords?
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.060]   Anything like that?
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.980]   I know it's kind of a complicated situation.
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.980]   Nope.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.820]   Miriam, go ahead.
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.420]   - Just wanted to ask if anybody
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.700]   had ever had any problems with this
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:42.700]   when they were dealing with their relatives passing away.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.380]   Was there ever any problem with passcodes and passwords
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:52.380]   and account numbers falling into the wrong hands
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.700]   and being used?
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:00.340]   - Well, I had the other problem is I couldn't get access
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:05.380]   to my late wife's email when she passed.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.580]   And that caused no end of havoc.
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:12.100]   So definitely important.
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.540]   After that BogleHeads thread,
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.780]   I did shift to 1Password and I've been very happy.
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.460]   Seems like a really...
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:24.100]   So I'm an advocate for a password manager,
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.940]   especially like 1Password where you can also store,
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.340]   you know, copies of files and, you know, scans and stuff.
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:38.340]   So it becomes a much bigger repository than just passwords.
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:43.580]   It's sort of where everything is.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.980]   - I was just wondering if we were overdoing the concern.
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:53.740]   - I think it's probably not overdoing.
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:58.100]   But, you know, you might be able to navigate
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.780]   through some of it, but I could not get, for instance,
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:05.980]   Google to get me access to my wife's account,
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.100]   even with a copy of the death certificate.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.940]   - The other thing I would add is many password things
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.300]   require two-factor and you better know your passcode
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:21.300]   of your partner's phone or have access to their fingerprint
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.980]   or facial recognition, which could be obviously problematic,
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:29.580]   but you may not be able to get into certain accounts.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.540]   - Okay, that's a good point.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:33.500]   Alan, go ahead.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:38.220]   - Yes, I don't know about other email programs,
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:41.900]   but Gmail allows you to set up a trusted contact
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.860]   that would be notified if you have no activity
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.820]   on your account after a certain period of time
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.980]   and would grant them access to your Gmail account.
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:55.980]   I presume, you know, iPhone and so forth
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.820]   probably have similar type abilities,
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.740]   as well as other social media,
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.860]   whether you're on Facebook and other social media
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.860]   to possibly have a designated trusted contact.
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.020]   - It's great to know.
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.180]   Bostonian?
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:18.540]   - I was wondering if anyone has done a dry run,
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.660]   so you have, let's say, a solid plan together,
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:25.660]   and then you say, all right, assume that I'm dead.
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:27.940]   Can you try and get into everything?
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.180]   Can you try and get access to everything,
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:32.940]   execute the plan like you would if I were not around,
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.340]   just to see if the whole plan works?
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.140]   Do people do that, or do you do your best and you hope?
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:43.620]   - Are you saying like test, pretend like you're dead
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.420]   and just test it out to see if people, is that what you're-
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.700]   - Right, right.
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.460]   So if my account doesn't do it, like, I am not here now.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.820]   You try out, like, we have a plan together.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.940]   And if something fails, better know now than later.
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.820]   - That's a good point.
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.380]   Yeah, that's something I think about.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.100]   Someone told me once where they forced their spouse
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.100]   to do the books or numbers once a year,
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.220]   so that they have to exercise their way
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.660]   through the checkbook, the brokerage accounts, whatever.
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:16.820]   - That's not a bad idea at all.
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.580]   Probably something, that's a good idea, probably, yeah.
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:23.260]   Doug, go ahead.
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.740]   - I was going to, I guess, third,
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:29.060]   what the other previous two people said is training.
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.940]   And what sounds right, twice a year?
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.380]   Does that sound good to go through from start to finish,
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.780]   pretending like you're dead?
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.380]   But I think that's about right, twice a year.
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:44.380]   - Twice a, maybe once a year might be enough,
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.100]   but yeah, twice a year is good.
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:50.460]   Depends on how long it takes, I guess.
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:57.220]   Okay, we're going to go to the next slide.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:00.540]   Okay, so this is a list of the information
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.300]   that's going to be helpful pretty quickly.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.300]   There's some things you can wait on,
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:09.500]   but there's some things you want to do
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.380]   the first couple of weeks.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.380]   So first of all, you want to have a list of people
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.820]   to call and contact.
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.380]   My parents have, a lot of this book is actually based
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.620]   on what my dad put together,
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.340]   and they have a whole list of people.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.620]   I think that they have their email addresses
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.500]   and their phone numbers.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.180]   I'm sure they would call everybody personally.
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:30.300]   But another way to do it would be to actually type up
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:35.020]   a list of emails and then mail that list
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.220]   to your spouse or whoever.
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.780]   And then they could use that at the time
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.140]   to either copy and paste individual emails
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:44.820]   or do a whole blind carbon copy
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.940]   where you just have to send that one in.
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.420]   It kind of depends on if you're good friends
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.260]   with that person.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.060]   If your spouse or child who's taking over knows that person,
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.060]   they may want to write a little personal note,
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:57.380]   but if they don't, they may not want to have to do this
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:00.180]   a hundred times and send out a hundred different emails
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.300]   or phone calls, whatever you want to do.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.900]   And as, Alan, you mentioned earlier in the chat,
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.540]   you could pre-write your obituary.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:10.060]   And my mom did this, and the reason she did this,
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.260]   she's like, you're not going to know,
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.060]   like my dad had military service.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:15.500]   You're not going to know the dates
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.460]   and when he went to Korea and this and that,
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.540]   and what his unit was.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.420]   I'm not going to know that information.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.100]   So she kind of put together,
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.220]   and she had to make sure all the relatives' names
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.940]   were listed correctly with the spouses
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.820]   and made sure all the,
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.380]   a lot of times you list like your educational information,
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.460]   military information,
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.340]   and a lot of times you don't know details
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:37.180]   of that kind of thing.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:40.660]   So you may not want to write up the entire obituary
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.740]   and say how great of a person you were,
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.300]   but you may want to list some details
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.660]   that the other people may not know.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.660]   So you definitely want to list your wishes
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.940]   as far as burial, cremation, church service,
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.700]   who you want to be, your officiant, favorite hymns,
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.700]   that kind of thing,
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.660]   whether or not you have a prepaid funeral policy,
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.020]   whether or not you have a,
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.980]   either you already have a cemetery plus purchase,
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.820]   or you have a preference for this particular cemetery,
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.060]   this particular kind of headstone,
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.820]   all that kind of information is very useful, of course.
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:16.700]   You may want to collect military benefits as far as,
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.260]   and I'm not real familiar with this,
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.900]   but my dad, he was a Korean war veteran.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.700]   He said, there's some kind of special medallion
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.900]   you can order, or you get it for free,
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.580]   and you put it right on your headstone.
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.140]   So I knew something about that.
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.700]   And you may be eligible to be buried in,
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.020]   what is it called?
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.260]   VA National Cemetery, is it in Arlington, or?
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:39.020]   - Yeah, Carol, my father-in-law passed away.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.300]   He was a Korean veteran also,
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:46.300]   and he chose and advanced the military ceremony.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.700]   So they had an honor guard.
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.180]   It was really nice, really, really nice.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.140]   And he was interned, although he was cremated,
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.060]   they have both in the ground cremation,
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.100]   and above ground, and in these columbariums.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.780]   It was just beautiful ceremony.
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.220]   He would have really liked it.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.260]   The other thing we did, which I recommend is,
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.740]   we wrote a personal obituary
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.620]   that we had people fill in paragraphs.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.380]   This was not for the newspaper.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.380]   This was for internal friends and family,
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.460]   and it included funny stories, and vulgarities,
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:17.300]   and all sorts of things
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.540]   that you could never put in the newspaper.
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:19.780]   You didn't want in the newspaper.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.620]   So it was actually two versions of the obituary.
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.100]   - Nice, nice, very nice.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.860]   So one of the things you probably wanna do right away
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.580]   is inform and collect on the life insurance,
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.060]   'cause that's usually pretty quick.
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.140]   From what I hear, you can get that pretty quickly,
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.140]   assuming, of course, you're gonna document later
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.580]   who all the beneficiaries are,
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.940]   and what the name of the company is, and that kind of thing.
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:41.860]   Inform Social Security.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.980]   Of course, the funeral director would do that.
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.300]   If there's any pension, you wanna inform them.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.220]   And from what I understand,
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.020]   if Social Security will take back,
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.300]   'cause they always pay on the first of the month,
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.580]   and if you say if you died on the second,
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:57.380]   they'll take it back, is from what I understand.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.420]   So just be prepared for that.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.380]   You wanna obtain multiple death certificates.
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.540]   From what I understand, 12 or even 20 is not too many,
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.980]   because a lot of places are gonna want originals.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:11.220]   And you don't have to do this right away, usually,
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.060]   but you may wanna consider going ahead
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.540]   and contact a probate attorney and start the process.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.620]   There are certain deadlines.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.500]   For example, nine months,
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.860]   if you wanna elect the estate tax portability.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:22.700]   From what I understand,
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.340]   there's a nine-month deadline after the death to do that.
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.540]   And then also, if you don't already,
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:29.380]   if you're not the spouse
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.580]   and you don't have access to the house and things like that,
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:34.340]   you probably wanna go ahead
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.700]   and start that process pretty soon.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:41.100]   You also wanna transfer and collect any accounts
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.860]   that the surviving spouse was named beneficiary of,
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.740]   for example, IRAs, 401(k)s.
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.700]   And I don't know enough to know the details,
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:54.180]   but I know there's a certain way you have to title the IRA
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:56.460]   to be able to have the full benefits
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:59.900]   of extending the RMDs and things like that.
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.220]   And I did put a link in there
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:05.500]   on how to title the IRA as you transfer it over.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.340]   And then also,
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.700]   there are certain required minimum distribution deadlines
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.100]   that even after a person dies,
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:10.940]   from what I understand,
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:12.300]   you have to meet those or you have to pay.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.700]   It's like a 50% penalty.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.740]   It's a very large penalty
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.540]   if you don't take out the RMDs when you're supposed to,
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:19.660]   I think, even after somebody dies.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.660]   Of course, one big thing
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.300]   is you wanna continue to pay monthly bills.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.700]   And we're gonna have a whole page on that later.
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.020]   And then these are kind of things
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.580]   where now we're getting to be a little bit later
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.580]   where after the accounts have been transferred,
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.780]   you wanna check on,
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.100]   you're gonna have to name beneficiaries
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:36.380]   'cause it's gonna be in your name now
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.220]   and you wanna double check all your beneficiaries.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.220]   You're gonna wanna notify credit bureaus
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.140]   and department of motor vehicles
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.020]   so they know your driver's license
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.300]   so you don't have identity theft.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.980]   Even after your death, you can have identity theft.
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.420]   Then the surviving spouse
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.380]   is gonna wanna check their existing state plan documents.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:55.580]   Sometimes it'll still be okay
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.580]   if you took care the first time
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.180]   to name all the contingent beneficiaries.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:01.700]   It still may be perfectly fine
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:02.540]   as long as you have,
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:03.980]   like usually people put their spouse
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.940]   and they put one of their children as contingents
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.220]   for like the power of attorney and things like that.
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.820]   So that may be perfectly fine.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.780]   You may not have to redo that,
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.780]   but you just wanna check on that.
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.020]   And if you've left emergency contact information,
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.020]   for example, with doctors,
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:18.780]   you'd wanna get that changed.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.980]   And then you also wanna think about
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:24.580]   your spouse may wanna attend a group support group.
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.300]   If you happen to know of any,
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.140]   you may wanna go ahead
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.580]   and have that contact information handy for them.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:33.780]   Does anybody have anything they wanna add?
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.740]   Jim, is your hand still...
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:36.740]   Your hand's up, Jim.
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.780]   - Sorry.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.300]   - Okay.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.380]   Lady Geek.
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:42.740]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.820]   Brings back a memory of some interesting experience.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:50.580]   Well, first, when you say death certificate,
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.620]   the only original death certificate
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.300]   is the one filled out by the medical person
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:58.740]   at the time of death.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.860]   Everything else is a copy of a death certificate.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.180]   I had a problem where my father passed away
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:06.420]   before a medical person could...
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.100]   He was at home,
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.580]   but the hospice nurse didn't arrive in time.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.580]   So he passed away.
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.340]   And she says, "I can't sign off on the certificate
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.980]   because I wasn't there when he passed."
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.740]   I ended up calling Philadelphia 911,
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:23.100]   explained the situation to have a EMT guy
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.820]   sign a death certificate.
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.740]   And then he called the medical examiner
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.580]   'cause they didn't know.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.060]   There's police coming to the house.
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:30.900]   Did this guy...
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:31.940]   Was there a crime involved?
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:35.620]   So I actually had a copy of the doctor's report
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.260]   a few days ago saying he was in terminal stages.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.260]   So to say everything...
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.980]   So when you say you get a copy of a death certificate,
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.700]   they say there's one original filled out
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.620]   by the attending physician or medical person.
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:47.780]   They're not present.
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:50.420]   The funeral home will not accept the body.
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.580]   I had to wait two hours and get all this stuff
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.620]   straightened out with the Philadelphia EMTs
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.980]   before they would even come and take the body.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:00.060]   So if somebody passes,
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:02.060]   make sure they're in a medical facility.
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.580]   But the other...
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:06.060]   Yeah, okay.
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.260]   The other thing was interesting.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:09.980]   I don't know if anyone else would experience,
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.660]   but only a bogal head would do this.
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.220]   When my husband passed,
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:18.740]   well, I said, I made arrangements for cremation
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.740]   for his funeral while he was in the nursing home.
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.060]   We made arrangements.
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.900]   The guy was an insurance agent.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.260]   He sold me a funeral insurance policy.
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.260]   Like I said before, they can increase the costs
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.180]   and you have to pay for it.
[00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:33.620]   So I started talking to him, "Are you an agent?"
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:35.100]   "Oh yeah, you're getting a commission for this?"
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.460]   "Yeah, it's only like 30 bucks."
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:37.300]   "Okay."
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.700]   So I signed it and I checked my account online.
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.100]   My husband passes.
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.300]   I look at the value of the policy.
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.300]   It increased $60.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.140]   The value of that.
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:50.380]   So he's gonna get paid $60 more than what he charged me.
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:55.180]   So I go in, I go in with the policy copy
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.940]   and I needed some death certificates.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.660]   I horse traded.
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:44:59.820]   I showed him the policy and said,
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.060]   "Yeah, you know, your policy is like $60 more now.
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.300]   Can I have it in cash?"
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.380]   So I negotiated with the guy
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.340]   to get three copies of the death certificate,
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.540]   the prices are set by the state in Pennsylvania.
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:13.420]   It's $20 per copy.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.420]   So I got, in exchange for that,
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:20.100]   I basically negotiated three free death certificates
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.860]   because of the life insurance policies.
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:23.820]   I just felt I got something out.
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.740]   I just had fun in negotiating at your husband's death,
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:30.820]   but it was just bugging me that because of the insurance.
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.220]   So I just really-
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.740]   - How many do you typically need?
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.180]   How many did you end up using and do you need?
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:37.140]   - Oh, that's nothing.
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:40.500]   My husband was also an army vet during Vietnam and stuff,
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.140]   but there actually is a VA cemetery
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:46.180]   within commuting distance from our location,
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.780]   but we chose cremation.
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:52.420]   I could have opted for a free VA funeral and burial,
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:53.980]   but we didn't go that route.
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.540]   I usually said like 10,
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:58.260]   and also the VA will supply three copies
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.820]   of the death certificate by the by.
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.580]   So they said, "How many will they give you?"
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:04.420]   He said, "20."
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:06.020]   He said, "Give me 10."
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:09.060]   So I still have a few extras.
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:12.140]   So I'd say, but we had no complications,
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.180]   but I thought 10 was a minimum number.
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:18.500]   And half the time they just wanted photocopies anyway,
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:21.740]   like Vanguard or whoever else I was doing it with.
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.660]   Oh, and social security, they gave it back to me.
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.020]   Yeah, also a file for the social security death benefit
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.420]   of 255, $255.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:32.020]   It's something.
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.140]   So, okay, that's why I just wanted to relay
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.700]   that interesting story that, yes, I'm a bogey head,
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.660]   and I negotiated at my husband's death
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.340]   over an insurance policy.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.620]   - Okay, thank you, Keith.
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:44.700]   Okay, PJ, go ahead.
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:48.100]   - Yeah, I had a recent experience
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.900]   after my mother passed.
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:57.180]   The beneficiary IRA was held at Franklin Templeton.
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:00.100]   And then the end of 20,
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:03.260]   I moved it to other ones at Fidelity,
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:07.980]   but somehow the RMD was forgotten
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.060]   as part of the going over.
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:13.980]   And then it wasn't recognized until a week ago
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.700]   when I was doing my taxes that I didn't have an RMD.
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.340]   So I wound up having to go through three people at Fidelity,
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.260]   and they actually have a group that does this.
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:26.060]   And it all got worked out,
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:29.780]   and the penalty is 50% of the tax.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:32.940]   But there is a,
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:37.260]   you can request a waiver of the tax
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:42.300]   and have to provide a letter of a reasonable cause.
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:45.820]   And mine was that it got transferred and got missed.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.020]   This was the first year that Fidelity had it.
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.500]   And it got, you know, I called them on Thursday night.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:56.180]   I talked to the retirement specialist Friday,
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.220]   and it was executed on Monday.
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.740]   And now I just had to draft a letter
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:05.820]   to include with my income tax submission this year.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:09.580]   So even though it was all done right,
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:12.500]   it got screwed up when you tried to consolidate
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:15.140]   into everything at Fidelity.
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:18.060]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.420]   Jim, your hand's up.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.220]   - I just wanted to point out on the VA stuff,
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:23.420]   one more thing is,
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.900]   I know somebody who interned at Cremation Remains
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.260]   or Cremate, I forget what they call it.
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.500]   Cremains, I think they call it.
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.100]   Five years or 10 years after the death of the person.
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:38.340]   So the other thing that they do is they provide the wife
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.660]   or a husband or partner can also do that.
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:42.300]   You'd have to find out from them,
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.500]   but they'll put two names on the headstone.
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.100]   So the person who served will be on the front,
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.940]   it'll say, you know, Korean War,
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.740]   and on the back could be the spouse.
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:54.020]   - Good to know, good to know.
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:55.900]   Joel?
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.140]   Do you have your hand up?
[00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.500]   - Yeah, boy, I just had a brain thing.
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:02.540]   I'm trying to remember what I was going to say.
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:03.660]   - You want me to call on Lady Deacon
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.500]   and then you can go next?
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:05.340]   - Yeah.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:06.740]   - Okay, Lady, go ahead. - Please.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:09.980]   - Okay, just from what Jim reminded me of,
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:11.900]   because my husband was a vet,
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:15.020]   he was entitled to a free urn and a free flag
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:19.220]   as part of the funeral director.
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.220]   And so he gave that to me.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:23.700]   I mean, the urn, he said it was worth $300.
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.460]   Okay, with nice wooden urn.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.860]   I did something else with the ashes,
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:29.380]   but they were scattered elsewhere.
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.100]   But yeah, I sound like I'm making this fun,
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:34.620]   but it was a horrible experience to go through.
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.540]   And when you're upset and angry,
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:40.980]   you tend to just be very vocal and just expressing yourself.
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.780]   So I say, yeah, it was a really bad time for me,
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.860]   but I guess just by negotiating with the guy,
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:49.700]   I was just kind of letting myself vent.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.700]   And also, by the way, in hospice,
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:53.380]   you do have a bereavement counseling.
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:54.580]   I did go through that process
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.260]   and that was actually very, very helpful.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.220]   So if anyone is on a hospice,
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:03.980]   please take them up their offer of bereavement counseling.
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:06.420]   And that can be done while the person is alive
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.420]   because it's a process that's about to happen.
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:09.940]   So please take advantage of that.
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.380]   It is free, supplied by the hospice
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.620]   and for a period of 13 months after the death
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.620]   for close family members.
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:18.460]   So, okay.
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:19.860]   - Okay, very good, thank you.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:20.700]   Oh, good to know.
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.540]   Joel, did you remember what you were gonna say?
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.740]   - I did, I did.
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:24.980]   Sorry about that.
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:27.940]   So as part of the estate plan,
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:31.260]   what I do is I keep a spreadsheet
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:35.500]   that's sort of tied to my automatic updates
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:39.980]   that splits out every account by the beneficiaries.
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:41.740]   So they can easily, you know,
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:45.820]   whoever manages my estate, my wife or daughter,
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:49.620]   you know, can easily sort of see at this point in time,
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:54.260]   you know, Joe gets 10%, Frank gets seven,
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:58.260]   Ismerelda gets 20, charities get this.
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:01.460]   They can see a spreadsheet that's real time
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:03.180]   with all of that information.
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:06.740]   And then I also gave sort of instructions
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:11.220]   for each of the inheritors on how to assume the account.
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:16.220]   So like I would want my wife to make the IRA or her own,
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:20.980]   whereas my daughter is gonna have a 10 year stretch.
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:25.980]   And here's the suggested way of going out to get it,
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:29.980]   you know, 1/10th in the first year,
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:34.220]   1/9th in the second year, 1/8th in the third year,
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:36.500]   and so on and so on.
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.460]   And I'm not sure if that's gonna be helpful or not,
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:44.460]   but I'm a little ADHD in terms of planning.
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.260]   It made me feel better.
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.900]   - Okay, very good, thank you.
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.340]   Keith.
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:53.500]   - I was just gonna add, you know,
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:56.500]   something to document for, you know,
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:00.900]   the person that survives if you pass is reoccurring charges
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:03.100]   that are either happening on your credit card
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:06.300]   or maybe being taken out of your checking account.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:10.500]   We had several of those when we went through it
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:14.260]   with my mom and dad and it was hard to get those turned off.
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.940]   They wouldn't accept that, you know,
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:19.420]   we were calling to say they needed to be turned off,
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:22.020]   they needed death certificates sent to them.
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:23.420]   Sometimes if it takes a while,
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:27.300]   you can be charged for something that's no longer necessary.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:30.220]   So if you're putting together a list of things
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:33.860]   for your surviving spouse or whoever,
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.340]   beneficiary to take care of, you know,
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:39.980]   that's something that they wanna understand
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:43.060]   what needs to be turned off, you know,
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:45.020]   immediately after your passing
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:46.500]   and how they're able to do that.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:47.980]   'Cause that can be, you know,
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:50.140]   hundreds or thousands of dollars a month.
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:54.900]   It can be anything from Netflix to an antivirus program
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:59.060]   and anything in between that person that passed away
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:01.980]   was being charged for that's no longer needed.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:05.180]   So you wanna make sure that you document those things
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:08.580]   so they're not sifting through your charge card
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:10.220]   looking for them
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:12.780]   and also that they know how to turn them off.
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:15.980]   - Okay, great.
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:16.820]   Doug?
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:21.260]   Oh, you're muted.
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:25.940]   - I don't know if this is the right time
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.740]   to talk about this right now
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.380]   or if it's gonna come up later,
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:34.260]   but what do you do in the case of elderly parents
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:37.820]   who aren't doing any of this due diligence?
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:39.900]   I'm not sure they have any planning at all.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:44.020]   And you know, they may not have that much longer.
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:46.580]   You're gonna be faced a big mess to clean up.
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.260]   Does anybody else have that problem?
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:50.260]   - Somebody, I don't know if it could have been you.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:54.180]   Somebody submitted that as a comment on the RSVP
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.460]   and I don't have a slide for that.
[00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:59.180]   However, I did put in quite a few links
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.300]   on different articles, books, podcasts,
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.100]   and that kind of thing.
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.980]   So let's talk about that when we'll talk about that.
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.140]   If anybody has any suggestions, I don't personally,
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:11.180]   but when that slide comes up with the links,
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:12.220]   we'll talk about that.
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:14.460]   That's definitely an important thing to talk about.
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.700]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:17.140]   - Sure.
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:19.100]   Okay, let's go to the next one.
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:22.300]   Let's see.
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:23.620]   Whoops.
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:25.180]   Okay, this is a real short one.
[00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:29.060]   Just a list of contact information for professionals.
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:30.380]   So while on the first slide,
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:32.580]   we had contact information for friends and family,
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.020]   that kind of thing to inform them.
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.780]   But this is people that you may have to work with,
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:39.660]   your surviving spouse may have to work with,
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.580]   probate attorney, the one that drafted the wills,
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:44.340]   and then it may be the same or a different attorney
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:45.380]   that you recommend.
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.220]   You may have one picked out
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:48.380]   that you want to probate the estate.
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.180]   And then any kind of other attorneys used,
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.580]   like if you have a real estate attorney,
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.940]   a business attorney, anything like that.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:57.060]   If you do use a tax preparer or a CPA,
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.780]   you want to obviously have that contact information,
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.100]   financial advisor if you have one,
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:03.500]   or if you don't have one,
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.700]   but you want to have one listed
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:09.500]   for your surviving spouse if they feel they need one.
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.220]   And any kind of insurance agents.
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.540]   Is there anything I left off this list
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:15.580]   as far as contact information for professionals?
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:17.580]   Can anybody think?
[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.060]   Keith?
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.100]   - I just wanted to add again,
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:23.180]   based on personal experience,
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:28.140]   my parents had worked with an estate attorney for many years
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:33.140]   and also had worked with a CPA for probably 20 to 25 years.
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:36.980]   Literally became a family friend.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:40.940]   And when my mother passed and we had to sort everything out,
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:45.860]   we leaned on them pretty heavily for a number of things,
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:50.860]   whether it was documents that the attorney had in his files
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:55.300]   or the CPA that was able to help out with things
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:57.020]   because of the knowledge that they have.
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:00.300]   So just from my experience,
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:04.060]   that was a huge help and well worth the additional fees
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.860]   that we had to pay for their consulting
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:08.820]   or whatever you want to call it.
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:11.820]   I think it would have taken us probably twice as long
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:13.300]   to get through everything.
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.220]   And we might've made some,
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:20.220]   what could have been costly mistakes without that help.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:23.700]   And that caused me to say that I wanted
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:26.020]   to have something similar
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:27.900]   'cause I'm the one that handles the financing.
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:28.980]   If something happened to me,
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:32.380]   I want my wife to be able to have somebody to call to say,
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:33.220]   can you help me?
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.060]   I don't understand this between her
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:38.220]   and whoever is helping her to do this.
[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:40.980]   So I think, although I know Bogleheads
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:43.060]   typically like to do everything themselves,
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:46.380]   they don't like to pay fees and expenses for other people
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.380]   when they can do it themselves.
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:50.380]   I will just say from my experience,
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:52.900]   it was very, very helpful and well worth the money
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:55.180]   to have these folks involved
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:58.340]   for a lot of complicated questions
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:01.580]   and help that would have taken us a lot longer.
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:04.540]   (mouse clicking)
[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.380]   - Okay, great.
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:06.420]   Thank you, Keith.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:09.380]   All right, let's go to the next slide.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:14.700]   Okay, this is kind of a big topic.
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:18.180]   Of course you wanna list all your investment
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:19.580]   and financial accounts,
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:22.820]   because if you have more than just a couple,
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.620]   your spouse may not know where everything is,
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:28.660]   or of course, power of attorney, agent, or anything.
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:31.380]   And I'm gonna say a disclaimer,
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:34.580]   take care, do not perform any transactions after death
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:36.540]   without consulting an estate attorney.
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:41.140]   Like I said before, someone suggested to me once
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:44.820]   that you should pick a trusted relative or friend
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:46.460]   to kind of help your spouse
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:49.980]   in addition to like any of the professionals
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:51.900]   that your spouse may need.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:54.820]   Sometimes they just want a point of first contact,
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:56.700]   and this could be like a trusted friend
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:57.780]   if they're just totally lost,
[00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:59.260]   like I don't even know what to do first,
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.100]   or I'm totally overwhelmed.
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:03.220]   You wanna, it's a good idea
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.460]   to have a trusted relative or friend picked out
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:08.700]   to kind of help your spouse with that.
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:12.100]   One thing that's good is to just have a printout
[00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:13.740]   of all your accounts, your net worth,
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.580]   just so that your spouse knows,
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:17.140]   oh, here, just get an overview
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.180]   of all your different accounts.
[00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:22.060]   Then of course you wanna list every single account,
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:23.780]   bank accounts, online banks,
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:27.180]   safe deposit box, whose name is on the box,
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:29.500]   which physical bank branch,
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:34.460]   where the key is, we've mentioned this earlier, the PIN.
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:36.940]   And also you may wanna kind of list what is in there.
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:39.860]   Do you have savings funds, car titles?
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:42.220]   So that person knows, oh, if I wanna get the car title,
[00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:43.620]   it's in the safe deposit box.
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:45.860]   Of course you wanna list all your investment
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:46.900]   brokerage accounts.
[00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:50.020]   And it's not a bad idea to print out maybe once a year,
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:51.140]   just the recent statement,
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.540]   we'll have all the list of the assets
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:56.860]   and the contact information for the institution on there.
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:59.420]   Of course, all your retirement accounts.
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.660]   IRAs, Roth IRAs, 401Ks.
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:04.460]   If you have an HSA, list of savings bonds.
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:06.220]   Some people may have savings bonds, paper.
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:09.060]   I know I have paper bonds and a treasury debt account,
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:13.300]   which of course is very hard to get into.
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:14.900]   People can't even get into their own accounts,
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:17.380]   much less somebody else's, right?
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:19.780]   Pension, if you have any college accounts,
[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:21.580]   529s, Coverdells.
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:25.060]   Listing real estate, of course your spouse is gonna know,
[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:26.820]   but just, you may wanna have a copy
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:28.260]   of the deed and the mortgage.
[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:29.820]   Your primary home, a second home,
[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:33.540]   rental homes, land, mineral leases.
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:36.140]   You may wanna actually list.
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:39.500]   And if you don't have a mortgage, you may wanna list,
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:40.420]   I think I have this on the other side,
[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:42.020]   but you may wanna list that
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:44.060]   because you may assume there's a mortgage on all of it,
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:44.900]   trying to find it.
[00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:45.740]   Oh, but it's paid off.
[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:48.540]   So you may just make a note if it's paid off.
[00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:50.740]   If you own a business, I don't know anything about this,
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:54.500]   but you might have certain business documents
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:58.100]   that you may wanna include information there.
[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:00.340]   And these are some kind of newer things,
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.500]   digital wallet services that have a balance.
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.100]   I mean, you could have $500 in your PayPal account,
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.020]   Venmo, Cash App, that kind of thing.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:10.380]   I know nothing about this, but cryptocurrency,
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.540]   you may have a cryptocurrency wallet somewhere
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:14.020]   that has a lot of money in it.
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:19.340]   Like I said, you could maybe print out a statement
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:23.780]   or at least download it to a place in your computer
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.540]   that's referenced statements or at least where they are
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.180]   so they have a general idea what's in the...
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.460]   Oh, did I accidentally...
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:35.980]   And there's a reference to a thread later,
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.420]   or I think maybe it's a Wiki page
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:39.740]   or a thread investment policy statement,
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:41.980]   just kind of like a rationale.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:44.620]   This is our asset allocation.
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:47.020]   We've got 60% of stocks and 40%.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.980]   And then you may wanna kind of explain why
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.860]   so that when your spouse, say for example,
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:55.420]   they may employ a financial advisor,
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:56.380]   this would be a good thing to have.
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:57.940]   We've always, we've done it this way
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.940]   and this has worked for us.
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:00.980]   And then maybe you're planning
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:03.500]   to change your asset allocation as you got older,
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.780]   that kind of thing, just your rationale,
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.300]   how you've been doing your withdrawals,
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.460]   your withdrawal policy, that kind of thing.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:12.620]   Let's see.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:15.620]   And then location on your...
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.220]   Any location on your computer
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.620]   of files that might be helpful.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.940]   You may have, like I have a file
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.660]   where I have all my dividends
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:25.580]   that are coming in from different places.
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.460]   I have every quarter, I have a list of dividends
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.580]   and that way your spouse knows,
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:31.860]   oh, I'm gonna expect a dividend in a month
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.340]   and that's gonna be helpful for me
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:34.740]   to have that cashflow, that kind of thing.
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.340]   Just any kind of spreadsheets you have,
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:39.980]   you may have estimated tax spreadsheets,
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.420]   network statement, something,
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:44.860]   just put the location of the file on there
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.580]   that might be helpful to them later on.
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:50.500]   Joel, do you have input on this side?
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:55.340]   - Yeah, we did a Wiki called a retirement policy statement
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:56.780]   that kind of takes it one level
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.660]   above an investment policy statement
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:02.660]   that kind of describes how retirement's supposed to work
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:06.740]   and what the goals were and how the money flows,
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.340]   how you get paid every month.
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:12.300]   That might be a useful thing.
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.580]   - Perfect, yeah, that's the kind of thing
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.700]   that the surviving spouse would wanna take to the,
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.340]   if they decided to hire a financial advisor,
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.180]   that's exactly the kind of information
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:23.460]   that would be very helpful for that kind of purpose, so.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:27.540]   Anything else?
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.020]   This is a pretty important,
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:33.500]   as far as, you know, it's so easy to miss a little account
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.580]   if you don't document all of them.
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.700]   You know, your spouse very well may not know
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.540]   and then you may never get anything in the mail
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:42.900]   if you're on a paperless system.
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.580]   It may be going to some email somewhere
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:46.780]   and they may never know.
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.220]   Even if you may have your tax statements
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:49.780]   going to paperless,
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:51.300]   you may never get anything in the mail.
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.980]   So kind of important to document every single account,
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.420]   even if it's even a small,
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:01.100]   you know, a couple of hundred dollars or whatever.
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.020]   Joan, did you have, another comment is your hands,
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.140]   my hand may still be up.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:06.500]   Lady Geek, go ahead.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:12.140]   - Just one thing, financial mortgage and also car title.
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:16.340]   Do you have a car title, let's say, or a car loan?
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:19.620]   - Right, yeah, I did not mention car loans.
[01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:20.820]   That's a good point.
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:24.180]   Yeah, you definitely want to list debts as well as,
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.340]   I think I have mortgage is in the bill.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:27.500]   There's a whole section on bills,
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.460]   but I didn't actually put car loans, but the mortgages.
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:32.580]   - Yeah, actually, if you lose a car title,
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:35.100]   a notary will get you a replacement.
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.620]   So it's easy to find.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.340]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:41.460]   Okay, let's go to the next slide.
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.340]   Okay, you want to document, of course,
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.900]   all your insurance information, you know,
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.540]   list all the types of policies you have,
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:52.260]   whether it be homeowner's umbrella,
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:56.100]   you may have a boat policy, of course, auto.
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:57.580]   You may have several different life insurance.
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:00.540]   You may have one from your employer.
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:01.660]   Hopefully you have one,
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.700]   or if you had one at the time when you were younger,
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.740]   you may not need insurance,
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.380]   your life insurance when you're older.
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:08.700]   One outside of your employer.
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.140]   So you may have two or more.
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.740]   You may have long-term disability, long-term care,
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:17.140]   several different types of medical, dental,
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.180]   Medicaid, Medicaid supplement, prescription,
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:21.420]   all those kinds of policies.
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:24.180]   Annuities, I guess, count as insurance.
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.980]   And of course, prepaid funeral insurance.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:28.940]   So you just want to list what types of policies you have.
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.740]   What's the insurance company, agent name,
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:32.620]   contact information, if you have that.
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:35.500]   Dollar amount on the policy, if there's, you know,
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.780]   for life insurance, that type of thing.
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:39.340]   Of course, who the beneficiaries are is important
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.900]   for life insurance, that type of thing.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:43.700]   Gauri, go ahead.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:44.540]   - Thanks.
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:45.780]   I have nothing useful to say,
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:49.460]   but I wanted to share a humorous quote from Charlie Munger,
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:52.740]   which is, "All I want to know is where I'm going to go,
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:56.300]   where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there."
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.340]   (laughing)
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:59.340]   - That's very funny.
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:02.900]   Doug, go ahead.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:05.860]   - Well, I think part of the final instructions
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.700]   ought to be to have the surviving person
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.180]   log into your email account
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.300]   at least once a week after you're dead.
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:15.180]   - Good point.
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:17.860]   You're going to have stuff for the next year, probably,
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:19.140]   once a week for the next year,
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:20.980]   'cause you're going to have stuff coming there,
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:24.580]   you know, regarding insurance and who knows what else,
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.100]   brokerage information.
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:27.860]   - That's a very good point.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:30.340]   And if you don't log in, eventually, after like six months,
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.500]   they could actually delete the whole account
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.420]   if you don't log in.
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:35.660]   - Yeah, that would be really bad, right.
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:37.340]   - To log in periodically.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:40.180]   It's kind of the same thing,
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.820]   like you're getting your mail,
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:43.660]   but nowadays, a lot of times you don't get mail,
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.380]   so, you know, you got to check in the email
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:48.380]   because there could be some very important, you know,
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:51.580]   tax forms or all kinds of things coming into the email.
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.020]   Lady Geek.
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:57.140]   - Okay, back to bank accounts.
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:00.060]   If while the person is still alive
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:03.460]   and you have a joint account and the person passes,
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.500]   do not close that account.
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:06.860]   It depends on the bank.
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.820]   Each bank follows the uniform commercial code for the state
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.340]   and it's up to the bank to decide,
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:15.860]   but you can deposit checks made to your deceased spouse
[01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:19.980]   if your name is on that account, it is legal.
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:23.620]   And the way you endorse the check is for deposit only.
[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:24.900]   That is a legal endorsement.
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.020]   You do not have to,
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:27.740]   you never have to sign a check, actually,
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:29.220]   unless you want to cash it.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.500]   For deposit only is a legal endorsement.
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:35.300]   So if they make an account, like once a year,
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:37.500]   I've been getting a couple dollar checks
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.460]   because my husband's had something that spits out a dividend
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:43.860]   like for a couple of dollars and I can't kill the thing.
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.420]   I can't get rid of it.
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:47.460]   That's another story where I have to file probate.
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.380]   I didn't file probate in this one County
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:52.420]   in Western Pennsylvania for some royalty thing.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:54.300]   And they have to have the file in that County.
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:55.380]   It ain't worth it.
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:59.620]   So, and at least below the amount that he has to pay taxes,
[01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.060]   it's like a couple bucks.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.540]   But the thing is, it comes in his name.
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:06.620]   I say for deposit only, it goes into my joint account
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:09.420]   and it's his income.
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.700]   So they say, but it depends on the bank,
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:14.420]   but that's why I have a local service bank.
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.860]   They do that for you.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:17.220]   So that's very important.
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:19.420]   Otherwise you'd have to set up an estate checking account,
[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.860]   which is a whole nother thing that I can go through.
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:23.500]   On life insurance.
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.340]   A lot of times you don't know if you're the beneficiary,
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:27.780]   you don't know if this person even had
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:29.020]   a life insurance policy.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.260]   How the heck, believe it or not,
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:33.980]   insurance companies want to find beneficiaries.
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:37.700]   When a person passes, they really do want to try very hard
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.340]   and give you your money.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:40.700]   So if I have a wiki,
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:44.620]   I put a link to the wiki's life insurance article
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:45.500]   in the chat.
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.900]   I did it earlier when I was talking about it,
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:50.740]   but in there, there's a way that you,
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:54.020]   there's a search that you can do for free,
[01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:57.860]   how to find if this person has a policy.
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:01.220]   It is well worth it to go through that process.
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:03.540]   Additionally, you don't know if that person
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:04.860]   has any unclaimed property.
[01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:06.580]   You know, they say unclaimed freight or whatever,
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:10.180]   but one thing that actually that policies,
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:15.380]   if the insurance company cannot find the beneficiary,
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:18.340]   that money goes to the state as unclaimed funds.
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:22.140]   So, and also other things go into there.
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.260]   Like somebody sent you a check like 20 years ago,
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:27.380]   they couldn't, it was never cashed.
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.380]   That goes to the state's unclaimed property.
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:31.180]   I've got a couple of bucks that way too.
[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.020]   Oh, they're searching for my own name.
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:36.540]   So search unclaimed property for yourself first,
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.220]   and then for this person who's deceased next,
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.260]   and you might get hit.
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:43.780]   You never know, you never know.
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:46.060]   So I just wanna say something about life insurance.
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.700]   Okay, I'm done.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:48.540]   - Very good, thank you.
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:50.180]   They're all good suggestions.
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:53.340]   Okay, let's see what the next slide is.
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:59.300]   Oh, okay, this is an important one, bills.
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.340]   Because of course, especially if you're living in a house,
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:02.500]   you definitely want your spouse
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:05.420]   to be able to keep the electricity on, that kind of thing.
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.620]   So you wanna know, let them know,
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:11.380]   obviously if they don't know where the checkbook is,
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.740]   and if you have a whole box of spare checks.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.900]   I don't know what those are.
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:19.820]   You wanna list all the bills, how it's normally paid,
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:21.620]   whether or not you get something in the mail,
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:23.980]   or you get something from the email,
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:27.860]   which is usually the two ways that you pay bills,
[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:30.180]   or sometimes they're automatically paid,
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:32.300]   but you usually do get an email notification
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.100]   of the amount or whatever.
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:36.500]   So the types of bills you wanna list,
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.340]   of course, credit cards, utility bills,
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.300]   insurance bills, mortgage.
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:42.740]   And if you wanna state if you don't have a mortgage,
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:45.260]   because somebody might not know,
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:47.820]   might be looking for your mortgage when you don't have one,
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:52.180]   property tax, cell phone service, cable streaming services,
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:56.580]   digital subscriptions, home security, fitness center, gym,
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:58.340]   any other online services.
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:02.860]   And there are some that you would wanna,
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:04.140]   you can let your spouse decide,
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.220]   but if you were into genealogy
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.620]   and you were spending all this money on ancestry.com,
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:11.820]   they might wanna cancel that right away,
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:14.540]   but they may not wanna cancel the cable service,
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:16.940]   the streaming, Netflix or whatever.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:20.660]   So they can decide, but you should at least list them.
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.380]   And then if you've forgotten a few,
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:25.500]   they can, it'll probably show up on the monthly bill,
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.820]   and then it'd be like recurring expense.
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:31.180]   One thing I was looking at today was,
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:33.500]   if your spouse just seems overwhelmed
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.340]   with the thought of having to pay the bills
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.180]   and figure all this out,
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:39.300]   there is something called a daily money manager,
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:42.740]   and this is a nationally certified professional.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.380]   I've never used one,
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:47.940]   but there's a website you can go to
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:49.020]   to find one in your area.
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:52.020]   And they are certified to be fiduciaries,
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.980]   and they have to have certain amount of education and exams.
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:57.580]   So that is an option.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:59.020]   They basically can pay your bills,
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:00.620]   organize all your finances,
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:02.900]   get it together, your tax information, that kind of thing.
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:06.340]   If for some reason your spouse is just overwhelmed
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:09.620]   and just can't deal with that kind of a thing,
[01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:13.180]   so that's just an option that I wanted to mention.
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.780]   Okay, does anybody have any...
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:16.140]   Doug, go ahead.
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:19.020]   - Yeah, if you've been doing all this stuff,
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.140]   let's say for 30 years,
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:24.900]   and your spouse has not touched any of it,
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.620]   they will get overwhelmed.
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:32.420]   So I think this is something that you gotta take over
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:35.220]   if you're especially getting towards late in life.
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:39.900]   Anytime you touch something financial,
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:42.020]   drag 'em to the screen
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:44.300]   and have 'em sit in a chair with you
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.660]   while you've logged on to your bank account,
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:48.780]   and let's say you've gone to the online
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:50.340]   bill-paying area of it,
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:54.860]   and just show 'em every month maybe what you're doing.
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:57.980]   I mean, now would be the time to include them.
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:01.420]   If it's been 30 years and they don't care less
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.580]   about anything financial,
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:04.700]   if you're getting late in life,
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:08.100]   now would be the time to get 'em involved
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:09.860]   instead of just waiting 'til the very,
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:13.580]   until here's a set of instructions after you're dead,
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.780]   'cause they're gonna get totally overwhelmed.
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:18.020]   - That's a very important point.
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:19.060]   I think you're definitely right.
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.420]   And I'm glad you mentioned bill pay,
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:21.500]   'cause I don't use that myself,
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.220]   but I should have made a point.
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:25.300]   If you log in, I don't even know how you do that.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.340]   You log into your bank account,
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:28.220]   and then a lot of times you can pay
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:30.460]   all your utility bills from there, right?
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:31.580]   I mean, I don't know exactly how that works,
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:34.460]   but I should have mentioned if you wanna mention that.
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:37.500]   - I never send any checks or anything in the mail anymore.
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:38.740]   It's all done online.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.660]   - Very important, Doug.
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:41.500]   Thank you so much.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:42.340]   Lady Geek.
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:46.380]   - Okay, you mentioned Netflix.
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:49.220]   Let me talk to you about Amazon.
[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:50.780]   When my husband passed,
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:53.780]   he was actually the primary holder
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:58.780]   of a ton of Kindle books that we both jointly read.
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:03.820]   He shared a lot of stuff under the family sharing thing,
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:07.380]   and also some of the services and video stuff.
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:08.580]   Everything was under his account.
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:10.740]   I had my account too, and we just shared.
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:12.140]   So when he passed, I called up.
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:14.100]   I actually had to call Amazon.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:16.660]   Believe it or not, it's possible to call Amazon.
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:18.580]   Explained, I said, "I have a death certificate,"
[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:19.420]   everything.
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:23.620]   He said, "Lady, just keep the two accounts."
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:26.740]   I asked him to combine all the shared stuff.
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:29.580]   They cannot do it.
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:32.620]   Long story short, yeah, but no.
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:34.980]   So he said, "Look, it's okay.
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:37.380]   "You can log into his account with his stuff.
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:40.580]   "Just go ahead and do it.
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:42.260]   "We know it's a household.
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:46.380]   "Just stop there.
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:47.820]   "No, sorry, no."
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:49.140]   So I now have two.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.020]   I actually have two Amazon accounts.
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:54.740]   What I did do was change his credit card to mine,
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:55.980]   just make it the same.
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:57.900]   And then when I re-upped Amazon Prime,
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.540]   I did it under my account.
[01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:03.340]   But the idea is Amazon cannot combine things
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:04.180]   that are shared.
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:09.140]   So just a little FYI, but it was okay to log in
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:12.420]   with his credentials because it's a family thing.
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:14.860]   - Joel?
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:17.980]   - I appreciate the tip on Amazon.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:20.420]   That was news to me.
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:23.260]   My personal problem was genealogy.
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:25.260]   I'm glad you mentioned that.
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:27.620]   My wife was very into genealogy
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:30.940]   and she didn't leave any instructions
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:35.220]   on what I should do with all the research
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:36.340]   that she had done.
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:41.620]   And it haunts me today that she didn't.
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:44.220]   I closed the account.
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:47.100]   I have no idea what happened to any of it.
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:52.260]   But I had no interest.
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:57.260]   And I ended up with piles of finished English dictionaries
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:00.300]   and English to Dutch dictionaries
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:02.580]   and all sorts of weird stuff
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:06.580]   that genealogists would love,
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:10.500]   but it was just clutter to me.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.700]   So this is one area where I kind of thought
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.660]   I failed her memory.
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:21.700]   If you're into an esoteric hobby like that,
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:24.860]   definitely arrange for somebody to take it over.
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:28.260]   - Good point, yeah.
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:32.780]   'Cause sometimes there's a cousin or something like that
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:34.740]   that might be interested where,
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.820]   usually genealogy, you're either interested or you're not.
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:40.100]   So that's a good point that you should kind of think
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.900]   all that through ahead of time
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:46.340]   and maybe link up your tree with somebody else's
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:48.660]   so that all the information in your tree
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:49.940]   is at least out there somewhere,
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:51.100]   maybe something like that.
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.340]   So that's a good something to think about.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:57.900]   All right, let's see what else we have.
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:58.980]   Okay, taxes.
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:03.180]   So the important thing is document
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:04.500]   how you've been filling it out.
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:07.660]   Are you using TurboTax, some of the other tax services?
[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:08.740]   Do you fill it out by hand?
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:09.580]   Do you use a tax preparer?
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:11.460]   Which one, the contact information?
[01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:14.900]   And then where the past 10 years,
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:17.620]   I guess you only need three, but maybe 10 years are stored.
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:19.100]   Sometimes they may be paper files,
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.540]   they may be on your computer in a PDF
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:23.420]   that you've saved from TurboTax, that kind of thing.
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:24.980]   They may be with your tax preparer.
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:27.940]   So those could be important.
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:28.980]   Obviously you want to use,
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:30.820]   notify the tax preparer in the case of death,
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:32.420]   'cause there may be some deadlines,
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:34.780]   like RMDs and that kind of thing.
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:39.660]   There is actually a deadline on preparing a tax return
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:42.220]   for the decedent, that kind of thing.
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:43.620]   Then there's also a couple other things
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:44.780]   that you may want to document
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:46.020]   that might be important.
[01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:48.140]   If there's a basis to your IRA,
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:49.580]   it's like say somebody who's been making
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:52.340]   a non-deductible IRA contribution for many years
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:54.820]   and never rolled over to a Roth for whatever reason,
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:56.020]   or converted to a Roth,
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:59.540]   that does carry over to the inherited IRA.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:02.620]   So that is important to know, that will save you some money.
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:04.220]   If you have a gift tax history,
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:07.260]   if you've given money to your children
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:10.540]   or above the exemption, the 15,000
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:11.980]   or whatever it is per year,
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:16.020]   you would have supposed to have filed a form 709.
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:17.540]   And technically those are important
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:20.980]   because they get subtracted from your lifetime exemption
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:23.420]   if you go above the, of course now it's 11 million,
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:24.980]   but it could go back down someday.
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:27.660]   And a lot of bubbleheads could be going above that amount.
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:32.660]   So if you had filed a gift tax form in the past,
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:36.780]   it would actually be important to have those forms.
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:40.580]   If there's any charities you contribute regularly,
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:43.620]   especially if there's a case of a small charity
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:45.660]   that they're highly dependent on you
[01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:48.300]   and you would like to continue that
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:50.100]   as part of your legacy when you die,
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.820]   you can't force your spouse or your children
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:53.660]   or whatever to do that,
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:54.820]   but you could make a suggestion,
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:56.940]   I really wanna support this.
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:58.580]   Of course you can put it in your will too,
[01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:01.540]   but that's just something to think about
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:03.940]   if you wanna support any,
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:06.180]   continue to support charities after your death
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:07.700]   in ways other than your will.
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:13.060]   Also think about your HSA, if you have a large balance,
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:16.500]   if it's your spouse, obviously it just becomes theirs.
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:22.940]   See, I did try to look into this top.
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.180]   I actually spent a couple of hours
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:25.220]   trying to figure this out.
[01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:28.940]   And there was some information in the bubbleheads wiki
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:31.180]   that it's not quite clear
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:34.780]   if the spouse can reimburse themselves out of your HSA
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:37.460]   for expenses that you paid before your death.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:40.060]   It's not quite clear, but it might be possible.
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:43.420]   So you may wanna have that information doc.
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:45.580]   Most people, if they haven't reimbursed from the HSA,
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:47.580]   they have a spreadsheet or something somewhere up.
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:50.580]   Here's all the expenses that were paid, but not reimbursed.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:54.780]   So that's just something to think about.
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:56.060]   Is anything else?
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:56.980]   Keith, go ahead.
[01:18:56.980 --> 01:19:00.140]   - Yeah, I was just gonna mention a couple of things
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:01.460]   that you would wanna document
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:02.860]   if something were to happen to you.
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:05.980]   Are you making estimated tax payments quarterly?
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:10.980]   You want your surviving spouse or executive or whoever
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.940]   to know whether you've done that or not.
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:20.300]   And also keep in mind that you'll have a tax return
[01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:22.780]   that'll be due if you've gotten income through half the year
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:25.140]   and you pass away in July.
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:27.580]   So surviving spouse is gonna need money
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:30.340]   to be able to pay taxes for you,
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:33.180]   depending on how everything's done.
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.900]   We just went through this with our mother
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:38.060]   with taxes for 2021.
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:41.220]   So those are things that you wanna keep in mind
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:43.500]   that need to be documented
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:46.620]   so that surviving spouse or whoever
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:47.900]   is able to take care of that
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:50.340]   and knows kind of the up-to-date information.
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:53.020]   - Very important, Keith.
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:54.260]   Thank you so much 'cause I completely forgot
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:56.140]   about mentioning the estimated tax payments.
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.100]   That's very important because how would they know?
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:00.460]   They'd have to dig through all your bank statements.
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.060]   How would they know that they may not know
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.180]   that you've made a large,
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:05.980]   you could have made a $10,000 estimated tax payment
[01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:08.420]   and they wouldn't know unless you...
[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:10.620]   So thank you for mentioning that, that's very important.
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:11.740]   Doug, go ahead.
[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:14.940]   - Yeah, I'm thinking that like this in regard
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:19.340]   to estimated tax payments and any other TurboTax tactic,
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:21.100]   this whole slide here basically,
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:24.420]   and also investment policies, all of that.
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:27.940]   If your spouse has just not taken an interest in it,
[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:29.540]   I don't think you can document all this.
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:32.580]   I think you've got to make a transition plan
[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:35.820]   to a professional to take your place after you're dead
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:40.940]   and maybe talk to them about what's going on
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:44.060]   and give them this information along.
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:46.180]   Have a meeting with this professional
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:48.260]   along with your spouse with the plan
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:50.500]   that you'll transition to this other person
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:53.220]   after you're dead, the professional to take your place.
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:57.220]   - Very good point because a lot of us,
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:59.060]   like I always do the taxes and I've been,
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:03.300]   for some reason, I've always been interested in taxes.
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:05.860]   So if something in an article comes up on taxes,
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:06.700]   I'll read it.
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:09.420]   And so I've been just learning about this for 30 years.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:13.220]   So it's hard to forget how overwhelmed somebody
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:16.620]   that knows nothing about it is gonna be when you,
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:18.860]   like they may not even know what some of this means,
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:19.860]   like what is the basis to write?
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:20.980]   Like, I don't even know what that means.
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:23.260]   I don't even know what, they may not even know.
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:24.700]   So they may be completely well.
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:26.380]   So I think it's a very good point that-
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:27.380]   - They're not gonna know.
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:29.140]   - And the reason they don't,
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.780]   they haven't been interested in it
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:34.180]   like you have been and I have been to kind of,
[01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:35.540]   you know, just out of interest.
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:36.500]   They don't care.
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.860]   They're not, they have other things they're interested in.
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:41.180]   So you're gonna have to get a professional
[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:43.220]   to take your place, is my opinion.
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.700]   - That's a very good point.
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:48.300]   And I don't think it's a bad idea to,
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:50.700]   even if you don't use a tax preparer,
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:53.580]   maybe just line one up and maybe just pay
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:55.580]   for an hour of their time to have a meeting.
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:57.500]   And then just kind of, like you said,
[01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:02.780]   smooth the path to them taking over, you know.
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:04.780]   So that's definitely a good idea.
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:08.340]   Okay.
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:11.100]   Anything else on taxes?
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:15.700]   Nope.
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:16.540]   Okay.
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:20.700]   The last thing in your book is gonna be,
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:23.940]   anything important you wanna mention
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:25.620]   that your spouse may not be aware of
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:27.740]   about the house itself?
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:28.740]   You know, the names of like,
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:30.300]   who services the heating and air?
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.220]   What's the schedule?
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:32.140]   You need to have like,
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:33.940]   like we have every fall and spring they come
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.300]   and they service, we have a contract,
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:37.740]   they service the air conditioner and that kind of thing.
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:40.300]   You wanna know who does that.
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.580]   If you have any handymen, a lawn service,
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:44.540]   plumber that you like to use, house cleaner,
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:45.380]   that kind of thing.
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:47.340]   You wanna have their contact information.
[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:50.540]   What kind of schedule you're on for lawn care,
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.220]   that kind of thing.
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.740]   Any special filter, you know,
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:54.580]   that kind of just,
[01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:55.940]   this isn't just examples of things
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:57.020]   that you might wanna mention,
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.580]   special filters that need to be changed,
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:01.540]   anything else kind of that wouldn't be obvious
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:03.900]   as far as maintenance on your house.
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:07.220]   And then also as far as contents of the house,
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:09.820]   and some of these things are not specifically financial,
[01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:11.260]   but since we're talking about all this stuff,
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.180]   it kind of goes, you know,
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:14.060]   goes in with all this kind of stuff.
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:15.420]   Location of valuable items,
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:18.660]   jewelry, coin collection, firearms, et cetera.
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:19.860]   And this is non-financial,
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.460]   but location of important family mementos
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:25.940]   or sentimental items, family photos.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:26.780]   And nowadays, of course,
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:29.420]   they could be physical photos, digital photos on a computer,
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:30.860]   but they may not even be on your computer.
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:32.780]   They could be in the cloud.
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:35.780]   And these could potentially be important photos
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:38.220]   that, you know, some of your relatives, your kids,
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:40.780]   of course, your spouse is gonna want to know where they are.
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:42.340]   So you wanna document that.
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:45.540]   Then we have the whole category of social media.
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:47.220]   It's called the digital estate plan.
[01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:49.220]   A lot of the companies like Facebook
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:53.700]   will have something called memorialization settings
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:55.700]   where you could think about beforehand,
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:59.660]   you know, do you want your account just deleted, wiped out?
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:02.740]   Do you want it memorialized where, you know,
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:03.980]   it's stated that you passed away,
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:05.780]   but then it leaves your page open
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:08.060]   so people can make comments in that, you know,
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:10.060]   that kind of thing after you're passing.
[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:11.660]   So you just kind of want to think about that
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:13.580]   and then see if, you know, Facebook,
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:15.460]   the other ones that you're on,
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:17.580]   what kind of settings they have
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:19.340]   that you could possibly, you know,
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:22.580]   fill some of that stuff beforehand and get it set up.
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:24.140]   Going back to the genealogy,
[01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:27.020]   you may want to just figure out
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.060]   what to do with that information.
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:31.740]   If there's another family member, if not your spouse,
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:35.140]   or maybe somehow merge your family trees
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:36.740]   in with somebody, one of your other relatives
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:38.380]   that you have a place to add
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.380]   on your portion of the family tree.
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:44.260]   And then of course, the whole category is pet information.
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.460]   If you have any preferences,
[01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:53.060]   if it's not, your spouse is not there to take your pet,
[01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:54.500]   who, you know, you might want to recommend
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:57.180]   almost like a guardian for your pet,
[01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.620]   if they have any special medical needs,
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:00.580]   you know, all that kind of information.
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:03.460]   PJ, do you have, you want to go ahead
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.780]   and share on this topic?
[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:07.820]   - Yeah, on the prior page,
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:10.780]   I think we forgot to include,
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:15.660]   is if the estate has not finished with probate,
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:20.500]   you have to do annual tax return for the estate too,
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:24.940]   which, you know, it's another thorn in the side.
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:26.580]   I would, I always say is if you don't like somebody,
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.700]   make them the executor of your estate.
[01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:31.660]   They don't have anything prepared
[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.260]   and let them figure out life.
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:35.020]   So-
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:37.860]   - Hopefully the estate attorney would be helpful,
[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:41.060]   you know, would be helpful with that.
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:44.740]   And maybe even have a CPA lined up for that kind of thing
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:45.740]   if you don't already have one.
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:46.820]   So, but yeah, that is important.
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:48.300]   If it's open for more than a year,
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:49.140]   yeah, you would have to-
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:51.860]   - Well, yeah, and you have to go through
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:55.820]   which assets remain in a trust
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:58.700]   that goes to the successor trust
[01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:00.580]   versus the things that have to be
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:05.500]   into the person that died estate.
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:09.180]   And you don't want to spend $2,000 for an attorney
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:11.260]   for something that's worth 50 cents.
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:15.980]   - Okay, all right, thank you.
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:16.820]   Doug?
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:22.540]   - This valuables in slide 11 is important.
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:26.820]   In firearms, when my father passed away,
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:31.820]   he had a army issue 45 and a valuable German handgun
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:34.940]   called a Walther.
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.820]   They got through World War II.
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:40.260]   When he passed away, my brother and my mother decided
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:41.460]   they don't want that around the house.
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:43.140]   So they called up Leisure World Security
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:44.420]   to get rid of these firearms.
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:47.580]   So Leisure World Security came over and took them away.
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:50.420]   I found out later they're worth thousands of dollars.
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:55.020]   So you could lose thousands of dollars
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:57.140]   if you're not aware, if the person who's living
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:00.020]   is not aware that there's some valuables around the house.
[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:04.140]   - And also there might be an issue,
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:05.660]   like I don't know anything about firearms,
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:08.500]   but there might be an issue where if it's registered
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:11.140]   to your name and you just give it to somebody else,
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:12.900]   it's still registered to somebody's name.
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:14.300]   And then if it's used in a crime,
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:15.980]   they could potentially, is that an issue
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:17.620]   where you want to make sure that it gets registered
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:19.980]   to the person that now has possession of it?
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:20.820]   Is that like an issue?
[01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:21.940]   - That's a good point.
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:23.900]   I always wondered what happens at home.
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:28.260]   - Miriam, go ahead.
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:34.420]   - I just wanted to say that home ownership is a lot of work.
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:37.060]   And I know we've lived in our home.
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:39.340]   We have a half acre of land
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:42.260]   and we've lived here for 28 years.
[01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:46.140]   And my husband still asks who are our lawn men,
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:47.820]   what are the names of our lawn men?
[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:52.420]   So it is, your spouse, when you pass away,
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:54.300]   your spouse simply may not be able
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:56.060]   to take care of the house
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:58.420]   and may not realize how expensive it is
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:00.260]   to take care of the house.
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:05.260]   So it's nice to include them while you're still around
[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:09.820]   as part of the family work,
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:14.820]   but it may be a big weight on them
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:19.060]   to take care of a big home.
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:21.300]   - Yeah.
[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:27.220]   But even cleaning out, that's a big job.
[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:29.860]   That's even probably even a big job in itself,
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:31.980]   either just selling the home or cleaning it out
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:32.820]   and getting it ready for sale.
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:35.940]   That's either way, it's gonna be a big job.
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:37.500]   - Decluttering all your stuff.
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:39.380]   - Yeah.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:42.900]   - Okay, thank you, Miriam.
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:47.780]   Any last call for comments on this page?
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:50.940]   See how we're doing on time, we're doing fine.
[01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:54.060]   Okay, the last page.
[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:55.700]   So that's the end of the,
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:58.140]   what we're gonna call the book.
[01:28:58.140 --> 01:29:02.780]   This is just a list of different,
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:07.100]   a lot of it, some of it's online discussions on boco heads.
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:08.580]   And a lot of this is stuff I just ran across
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:10.820]   when I was kind of trying to do a little bit of research
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:13.460]   and trying to make all my lists.
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:19.180]   And then when we post this slide show, it's a PDF.
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:22.340]   These links will be live where you can just click on them.
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:24.060]   You can't click on them right now, obviously,
[01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:26.940]   but when you get the, or maybe you can, can you?
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:33.940]   So when you get the slides, you can just click on these.
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:36.940]   So this was just mostly boco heads discussions,
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:40.740]   a couple of other articles that were along these lines.
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:43.380]   Some podcasts I listened to that were very helpful.
[01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:45.980]   Oops, a couple of books that were mentioned.
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:48.420]   And then, okay, this last page,
[01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:52.500]   this is something that was in one of the,
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:56.140]   in the RSVP forum, somebody mentioned,
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:30:01.140]   how do I get my, encourage my parents to document,
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:04.180]   'cause we're talking about you documenting for your spouse,
[01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:05.860]   but then there's also the issue of
[01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:08.020]   if you've got parents that are still living,
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:10.020]   you wanna make sure they have documented them
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:13.180]   for when you're, you may be having to be the executor
[01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:14.020]   on their estate.
[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:17.820]   And sometimes people are reluctant to even talk about it
[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:21.380]   or they may agree in theory, yeah, I'm gonna do it,
[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:23.820]   but this is, it's a huge job to document all this.
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:26.180]   So it's difficult.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.580]   So I ran across, there's a lot of articles
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:29.860]   and some of these were really good.
[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:30.900]   There was a YouTube video.
[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:32.300]   This podcast was really good.
[01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:34.780]   The first third of it was talking about
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:35.900]   this guy telling his story,
[01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:38.060]   what happened when his mom didn't have a will
[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:39.900]   and all the, you know, you can only imagine
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:42.260]   what kind of issues you run across.
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:44.900]   And then the last two thirds was a woman
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:46.460]   who had written this book,
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:48.020]   this book called "Mom and Dad, We Need to Talk,"
[01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:49.660]   how to have essential conversation with your parents
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:50.860]   about their finances.
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:53.020]   She was interviewed in this podcast about,
[01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:57.100]   you know, what, if your parents don't plan it,
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:59.140]   how to gently encourage.
[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:00.620]   And everything that I've read was like,
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:02.020]   you don't wanna make it about you.
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:04.140]   You don't wanna be what, you wanna make,
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:06.220]   you don't wanna be about them making your job easier.
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:10.580]   You wanna be about, make it about you honoring their wishes
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:13.260]   and making sure that you honor their legacy and their wishes.
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.580]   You kinda wanna frame it in that,
[01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:16.260]   but even then it's gonna be,
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:18.780]   if they don't wanna do it,
[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:20.820]   it's gonna be hard to convince them.
[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:22.100]   So I don't have a lot of,
[01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:24.580]   Keith, go ahead, maybe you have some good advice.
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:27.020]   - Yeah, I just wanted to add resources.
[01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:32.020]   I get the Oblivious Investor email
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:36.940]   and there was a link to an article,
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:38.940]   what you need to know about estate planning
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:42.980]   from White Coat Investing.
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:45.900]   And so I clicked on it and it was, it's gosh,
[01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:46.900]   I mean, I printed it out.
[01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:49.780]   It's a good, I don't know, 15 pages.
[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:53.020]   And it goes over in pretty good detail,
[01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:55.700]   a lot of things that you should consider.
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:57.700]   And because as I mentioned earlier,
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:00.740]   I'm in the process of redoing ours,
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:03.220]   I'm using it partially as a guide.
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:05.060]   I apologize, I don't have the link
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:06.900]   that I can put into the chat.
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.700]   It was written February 12th of this year.
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:12.900]   So it's up to date and current,
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:15.020]   and it has a lot of great information
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:16.980]   on a lot of the stuff we're talking about
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:20.340]   in kind of a detail where you could, if you want,
[01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:22.020]   print it out and have it in front of you,
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:24.820]   maybe to follow and learn from.
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:26.380]   So I just wanted to throw that out there
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:27.820]   as another resource.
[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:33.140]   - Okay, so that was on the Oblivious Investor blog?
[01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:36.940]   - It was, yeah, it was the email that he sends out.
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:39.220]   I probably got it maybe six weeks ago,
[01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.380]   four, six weeks ago.
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:43.020]   - He referenced the White Coat Investor, you said, or?
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:46.260]   - And it came from White Coat Investors, yes.
[01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:48.780]   - So it'll probably be on either one of those websites.
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:51.780]   - It was written by a Dr. James Dolly,
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:56.020]   D-A-H-L-E, White Coat Investor founder.
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:58.620]   And it's got a lot of great information on estate planning.
[01:32:58.620 --> 01:33:00.420]   - Great, that sounds very helpful.
[01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:06.500]   Okay, well, that's our last slide.
[01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:09.060]   So if anybody has any final comments,
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:11.780]   and then we're going to make sure we save the chat,
[01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:13.180]   or we're going to go over how to save the chat
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:14.380]   because there's a lot of information.
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:16.980]   Everybody's been entering a lot of really helpful links
[01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:18.140]   and information and stuff in the chat.
[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:21.220]   Is there any just final comments somebody wants to make
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:23.460]   about just wrapping this up overall?
[01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:25.660]   Anything we forgot to cover?
[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:29.140]   - I actually would just, if I can throw two things out there
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:30.860]   just kind of maybe random.
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:33.060]   The first is, at the beginning,
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:35.580]   somebody talked about when you move to another state,
[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:37.500]   you want to make sure you update.
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:38.940]   That's absolutely true.
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:42.420]   And, you know, we were just on a Bogleheads meeting
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:43.940]   maybe a month, month and a half ago,
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:46.660]   where we talked about moving, relocating, and retirement.
[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:49.180]   So that perfectly fits with conversation
[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:50.860]   that a lot of us are having.
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:52.100]   But I would also add,
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:54.780]   if you have some kind of a change in your life,
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:59.220]   for example, you have a grandchild that you didn't plan,
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:01.300]   you know, when you written it
[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.060]   and when it was developed initially,
[01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:06.380]   or, you know, something else that happened
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:08.740]   where you want to make some changes
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:12.340]   or tweaks to your state plans that weren't in there
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:15.060]   when you wrote them maybe a year or two or three ago.
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:17.260]   You start to have things like, you know,
[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:19.660]   grandchildren, et cetera, et cetera, that get added.
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:21.820]   And all of a sudden, if you're leaving money,
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:24.140]   you need to make adjustments to that.
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:25.620]   The other thing I would just mention
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:29.220]   is to watch about tax changes that happen.
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:34.220]   For example, there's a change to Roth IRAs for beneficiaries
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:37.500]   in terms of how they have to be drawn down.
[01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:39.940]   That's different from what it was before.
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:41.740]   There's other things that are, you know,
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:44.140]   on the table or being talked about.
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:47.740]   So think about how tax changes that you read about
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:50.620]   in the newspaper or wherever you get your news from,
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:53.380]   how that might affect your estate planning
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:55.300]   or something that you already have written.
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:58.260]   Do you need to go back and make a tweak to it
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:02.220]   or a change to it based on something that changed
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:05.740]   that might affect how you want to pass your money down
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:07.100]   or what have you?
[01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:07.940]   'Cause a lot, you know,
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:11.580]   sometimes it can be pretty impactful dollar-wise
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.420]   and you want to make an adjustment to that.
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:15.580]   So just a couple of things to think about
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:18.660]   as you maybe already have an estate plan,
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:20.620]   but you need to make adjustments to it.
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:24.700]   (upbeat music)
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:28.100]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:31.500]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:35.860]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:39.420]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:51.820]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:35:51.820 --> 01:36:05.820]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:10.180]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:28.180]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:32.540]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:45.540]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.900]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:37:06.900]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:11.260]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:20.260]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:22.840]   (upbeat music)
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:25.420]   (upbeat music)
