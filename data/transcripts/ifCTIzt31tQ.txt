[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   I get a lot of questions about birth control,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.180]   but on my social media handles.
[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.980]   - Don't we all, don't we all?
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:09.820]   - To be clear.
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.180]   It's a vast topic for exploration,
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.700]   but along the lines of what we're talking about now,
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.660]   I've heard, and I suspect it may not be true,
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.660]   but tell me, is there any evidence that taking birth control
[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.740]   can disrupt the process that you just described?
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.900]   And when we talk about birth control,
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.460]   we should probably define what we're talking about.
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.860]   So there are hormone-based birth controls, AKA the pill.
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.340]   There are also hormone-based birth controls
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.640]   that are not in pill form.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.620]   There are IUDs that are copper IUDs.
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.580]   There are other IUDs.
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.340]   Let's just talk about hormone-based contraception
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.340]   in females, which many of them, as I understand,
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.640]   are estrogen mimics or estrogen themselves
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.220]   that suppress ovulation.
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.620]   Do they diminish or increase the number of eggs
[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.960]   that are taken from the vault?
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.200]   - Fantastic question.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.200]   Let's talk about what people say is the pill.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.720]   So let's specifically talk about
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.700]   combined oral contraception,
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.940]   the pill which has ethanol estradiol
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.940]   and some type of progestin.
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.800]   No, contraception does not change
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.520]   the release of eggs out of the vault.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.180]   They are occurring at the same process and the same pathway.
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.820]   You're not ovulating because that estrogen does prevent FSH
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.260]   from coming from the brain.
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.820]   So you have the group of eggs still come out of the vault.
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.980]   There's no FSH.
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.200]   They just all die.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.300]   The next group comes out.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.640]   So when you are saying,
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.120]   are you gonna run out of eggs faster?
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.700]   Is it gonna harm your fertility?
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.120]   Does birth control impair the process?
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.380]   The answer is no.
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.560]   But there's a couple important caveats.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.340]   One is that the birth control pills,
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.940]   especially if you take them continuously
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.460]   or for a prolonged period of time,
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.260]   the body's smart and the ovaries start to say,
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.100]   well, we're not really doing anything.
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.380]   And one of those markers of ovarian reserve we have is AMH
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.460]   and that's anti-mullerian hormone.
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.720]   And AMH is made from the granulosa cells
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.340]   or the cells that surround every follicle.
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.640]   So in the shortest way possible,
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.120]   more eggs in the vault, more come out every month,
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.300]   higher AMH.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.820]   Fewer eggs in the vault, fewer come out, lower AMH.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.220]   If your AMH is being suppressed
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.860]   because of the birth control pill,
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.460]   because it's decreasing the activity
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.380]   of those granulosa cells,
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.380]   you might get a low AMH value
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.100]   when you've been on the birth control pill for a long time.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.580]   That is completely reversible.
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.100]   But it can be significant.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.720]   So if somebody is wanting to get an AMH level,
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.280]   let's say somebody comes to my clinic,
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.400]   they're not trying to get pregnant and they're on the pill
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.660]   and they're considering freezing their eggs
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.220]   so we're going to check their ovarian reserve.
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.900]   If we draw it, I always say this,
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.980]   AMH may be up to 30% lower
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.500]   than somebody who is on the birth control pill.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.980]   So we can still draw it.
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.460]   And if it comes back in the normal range, we feel good.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.900]   But if it does come back low,
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.800]   we're going to have to make a decision.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.900]   Are we going to stop the birth control pill
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.720]   for a period of some months,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.180]   use alternative contraception
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.300]   if you don't want to be pregnant,
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.460]   and then repeat this test to see if this is a true low
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.500]   because we do see that young women
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.100]   do have low ovarian reserve sometimes,
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.440]   or was this just suppressed
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.540]   because you were on the birth control pill?
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.300]   So we see it impact some of the hormone testing
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.380]   that we can do.
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.820]   And I think that's an important distinction.
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.360]   And we can see that the longer you take it,
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.300]   that potentially it might actually improve your fertility
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.500]   if you had underlying endometriosis
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.500]   or some medical conditions
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.820]   that we see associated with infertility.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.100]   So prolonged pill users
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.360]   can potentially improve their fertility
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.100]   versus people who are trying to get pregnant that same age
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.020]   who were not on the pill.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.300]   Those studies are complicated, right?
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.420]   Because of selection bias.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.300]   Because if you've been on the pill for 10 years,
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.900]   you're a little bit older.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.100]   So is it that they were preventing pregnancy
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.420]   and the other group potentially had some exposures
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.560]   so they were inherently more infertile
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.780]   than the group that was on the pill?
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.700]   But we do know that the pill doesn't cause infertility.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.040]   And I use it all the time.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.620]   All the time in IVF cycles,
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.900]   we put people on the birth control pill
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.820]   because we can actually synchronize that group of eggs
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.580]   that comes out of the vault to grow together.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.660]   Because your body doesn't want to have
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.540]   20 babies at one time, right?
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.860]   And what we're trying to do with IVF,
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.640]   get 20 eggs to grow if that's what's out of the vault,
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.880]   really goes against the check and balance of the human body
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.860]   to not have 20 babies at once.
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.240]   - Why is it that males who take testosterone,
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.740]   synthetic testosterone,
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.900]   it shuts down their own testosterone production
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.900]   and sperm production,
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.380]   but females who take estrogen
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.620]   in the form of birth control pills,
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.500]   it doesn't shut down estrogen production by the ovaries?
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.160]   - So I love this question.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.000]   You know the answer,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.300]   so I like it extra because I know you're asking.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.140]   Spermatogenesis is a constant and ongoing process, right?
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.140]   So in women,
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.340]   you're born with all the eggs you're ever going to have.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.260]   And what we're talking about is if we stop FSH
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.260]   at that moment,
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.980]   we're just impacting the ability to ovulate at that time.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.780]   But we're not changing this constant loss
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.900]   throughout the vault.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.260]   Spermatogenesis, right?
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.100]   The sperm is made every single day,
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.440]   you're making brand new sperm.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.560]   So 72 days for the sperm to be created in the testes
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.620]   and 18 days to find their way out the ejaculatory system.
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.700]   And so exposures that you have
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.480]   that stop the production of FSH and LH
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.460]   inhibit the development,
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.300]   the creation of new sperm.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.460]   So somebody who's been on testosterone
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.540]   will tell the brain,
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.260]   the brain doesn't know it's from your taking it.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.540]   It says, "Hey, we have plenty of sperm, we're good.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.820]   We don't need any more."
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.480]   So the brain then gets suppressed
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.020]   and doesn't make that FSH and LH,
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.620]   therefore not stimulating both
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.120]   for their testosterone production,
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.640]   'cause you don't need that.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.460]   But testosterone production and sperm production
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.300]   go hand in hand.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.300]   So therefore you're no longer making new sperm.
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.060]   And in fact, the longer you're on testosterone,
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.500]   the harder it may be to get sperm production to come back.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.340]   And in 25% of people, they may not get it back
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.260]   if they've been on prolonged testosterone exposure.
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.060]   So it's really because of what
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.640]   women will sometimes say is unfair,
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.920]   which is the fact that you're born with all these eggs
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.100]   and you run out of them.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.020]   They accumulate the wear and tear of your life, right?
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.400]   We see egg quality being a huge issue
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.160]   and female reproduction,
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.700]   yet men get to have new sperm every 90 days.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.160]   They get to wash away whatever bad deeds they did
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.420]   and can change their lifestyle and their exposures
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.500]   and have very different sperm.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.460]   But because of that same process,
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.840]   things that shut off the production of FSH, LH
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.420]   really impact sperm quite significantly.
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.620]   Is there any evidence that birth control,
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.780]   oral estrogen progestin-based birth control,
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.140]   just to keep it specific,
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.820]   can increase rates of cancers,
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.700]   can decrease rates of cancers,
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.620]   can lead to any sorts of disruptions
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.260]   in bodily function or health
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.600]   that's really like a rock solid result
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   that's been seen by multiple studies, clinical trials,
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.180]   or are we still just in the dark about a lot of this stuff?
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.280]   - Okay, so nothing is without risk.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.800]   Getting pregnant's not without risk.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.400]   Taking the birth control pill is not without risk.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.400]   We do see that there's been a lot of not informed consent
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.800]   in people who are taking the birth control pill,
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.920]   meaning maybe they weren't educated
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.380]   about what all of their options were,
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.460]   the positives and the negatives about each one of them.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.840]   If we're gonna reference the convo to the pill,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.360]   estrogen progesterone pill,
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.380]   important to understand that neither the estrogen
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.980]   nor the progesterone are the same estrogen progesterone
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.700]   that your ovaries make, right?
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.120]   It's ethanol estradiol,
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.700]   which your brain interprets as an estrogen,
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.980]   but other parts of your body may not.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.740]   And then it's various types of progestins,
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.700]   some of which have even androgenic
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.660]   or male hormone-like properties,
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.420]   and some of which do not.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.220]   So there's a ton of variation,
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.580]   even the amount of ethanol estradiol that each pill has
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.380]   with your low low and your low pills having less,
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.600]   and even with the modern day average pill
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.260]   having a lot less estrogen than it used to.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.340]   When you're on the birth control pill,
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.620]   your ovaries aren't making estradiol.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.400]   And that estradiol is important
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.620]   in growing the uterine lining,
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.060]   but also for the genital structures.
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.180]   And so we think about vaginal health and vulvar health,
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.540]   we certainly see that especially with continuous use.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.740]   So if we distinguish, you take the pill for 21 days
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.020]   and you have a seven day break where you might bleed
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.680]   or you take sugar pills and then you take them again,
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.420]   a lot of people now are taking continuously
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.580]   where you have exposure to these compounds every single day.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.580]   - So in like the wheel, the little pouch with the wheel
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.400]   of different colored pills,
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.100]   may have seen these on the countertop
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.900]   in previous relationships.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.820]   And then there's the ones that sometimes people
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.820]   just opt not to take because those are the,
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.980]   not the placebo, they're the sugar pills.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.420]   There's no need to take estrogen during that phase.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.700]   And then they repeat.
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.540]   - Exactly.
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.380]   - Okay, but some people are taking estrogen
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.220]   all the way around the dial. - Continuously,
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.580]   it's very common right now.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.960]   So people, and they're not wrong, they say,
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.340]   oh, well, why have a period in these little breaks?
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.380]   It's not really a reflection of my hormone status,
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.460]   which is accurate.
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.660]   And so they're taking them continuously.
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.200]   You also have less pill failure pregnancies.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.140]   So if you're using the pill for contraception,
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.820]   that can be a great strategy.
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.780]   But the longer you take them,
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.100]   we do see some vaginal and vulvar changes, right?
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.260]   And so atrophic vaginitis,
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.500]   people who notice increased sensitivity,
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.380]   decreased elasticity, increase discomfort with intercourse,
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.340]   increase in yeast infections,
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.420]   that can sometimes be seen
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.020]   because that environment is different.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.000]   Now, that's just one thing that can come from the pill.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.280]   We also see the pill be lifesaving for other people.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:03.060]   They have terrible PMS or premenstrual dysphoric syndrome
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.180]   where their mental health,
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.420]   when they change from high to low estrogen,
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.260]   it's always the change in estrogen that interferes,
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260]   can cause some people to really have mental health issues
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.660]   that are so severe
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.980]   that having that stable hormone level is helpful.
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.860]   And so the pill can be extremely beneficial for some people
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.260]   when it comes to mental health.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.600]   It can be beneficial for people who have issues
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.540]   with very heavy periods and anemia.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.420]   Instead of getting blood transfusions,
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.120]   taking the birth control pill might prevent the lining
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.940]   of the uterus from growing so much that they bleed so much.
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.100]   Same thing with fibroids.
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.500]   People with PCOS.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.220]   PCOS is polycystic ovarian syndrome.
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.120]   If we wanna put it very simply,
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.440]   you have a lot of eggs in your vault,
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.560]   so you release a lot of eggs every month.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.060]   And what this does is the FSH signal gets diluted
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.040]   and so you're not responding to the normal signal
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.540]   and you don't ovulate.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.060]   And because the ovary is a hormone-making factory,
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.020]   it gets really bored when it can't make estrogen
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.340]   'cause that egg's not growing,
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.180]   so it starts to make testosterone.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.860]   So you start to see this androgen-dominant environment
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.240]   associated with lack of ovulation
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.540]   and having a lot of follicles inside the ovary
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.020]   that are not really responding.
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.520]   - Androgenization, excuse me, androgenization
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.000]   of other tissues like body hair,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.020]   deepening of voice. - Yeah, body hair.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.940]   Typically the level of testosterone made in PCOS
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.380]   isn't truly deepening voice.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.140]   It can if there is an ovarian tumor making testosterone
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.240]   or certain other conditions.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.260]   But typically with PCOS, you see increase in body hair,
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.460]   increase in acne, and you can see some
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.340]   even like male pattern balding,
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.700]   some temporal balding of women, so some hair loss.
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.700]   - Temporal balding, so like the widow's peaking?
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.620]   - Yeah, the widow peaking and then thinning out
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.340]   in these two areas.
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.860]   And then we see an increase in body composition
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:51.800]   towards the male level.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.260]   So if we think about a male body holding your fat
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.220]   in your abdominal region,
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.540]   and if we think about the traditional female body
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.540]   holding more fat in the hips and thighs area,
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.220]   we see that when this hormone shifts in PCOS,
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.840]   you tend to get more abdominal fat distribution,
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.440]   which then leads to further insulin resistance
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.880]   and metabolic syndrome.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.060]   But in PCOS, because you're not ovulating,
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.340]   and those ovaries, each little follicle
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.360]   makes a tiny amount of estrogen.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.700]   We'll say each little follicle, when it's not responding,
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.680]   will make one to two picograms of estrogen.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.620]   But if you have 50 of them each month,
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.900]   you're having some constant estrogen exposure.
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.220]   So that lining of the uterus
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.340]   is being constantly stimulated to grow,
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.280]   and you're never getting the progesterone to stabilize
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.580]   or the progesterone withdrawal to bleed.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.440]   So endometrial cancer is much higher
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.260]   in people with PCOS who don't ovulate,
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.000]   and the birth control pill can prevent that.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.460]   Any unopposed estrogen situation,
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.220]   because the body is made to have
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.820]   both estrogen and progesterone.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.820]   So we see an immense decrease in endometrial cancer,
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.860]   an immense drop in ovarian cancer.
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.740]   Ovarian cancer comes from the remodeling of the ovary.
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.740]   So every time you have a follicle grow, and it ruptures,
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.780]   and it makes the corpus luteum, and then it heals up,
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.780]   those are opportunities for those cancer cells
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.180]   to go away in that remodeling process
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.500]   and lead to ovarian cancer.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.940]   And because you're not ovulating on the pill,
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.420]   your incidence of ovarian cancer drops dramatically.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.500]   10 years of pill use has dropped the chance
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.300]   you get ovarian cancer by more than 90%.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.780]   And of course, ovarian cancer is super hard to diagnose
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.780]   because the innervation to the peritoneal system is poor,
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.300]   and you don't have any outward signs
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.640]   often till late-stage disease.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.760]   That being said,
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.060]   could you potentially have an increase in breast cancer
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.180]   in some people?
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.020]   - By taking the pill?
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.180]   - By taking the pill.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.380]   That's a concern, especially in people
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.940]   who might be predisposed to this for some other reason.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.900]   - They might have BRCA mutations or something like that.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.260]   And then is there a situation where the pill
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.740]   certainly masks what's going on with your menstrual cycle?
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.780]   And I really think this is where women's health
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.100]   has a huge history in paternalism,
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.180]   meaning doctors will just tell people,
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.620]   this is what you're going to do.
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.380]   So your periods are irregular,
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.180]   here is the birth control pill.
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.980]   And they're not explaining why or the pros and cons to it.
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.740]   And what happens is people are not being taught
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.500]   how their bodies work, and now they are
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.380]   because of your podcast amongst others.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.860]   And now they're able to know that my period's a vital sign
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.020]   and I don't know what it is,
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.900]   because the pill is producing a different environment.
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.740]   The pill's also been associated with
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.320]   potentially development of things like leaky gut or IBS.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.700]   And so there is a definite change in your environment
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.040]   when you're on the birth control pill.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.620]   Increased risk of blood clots
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.900]   because of how it's processed in the liver,
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.460]   increasing your clotting factors.
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.260]   - Can I just interrupt there?
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:58.260]   You know, I'm aware that a fairly high percentage of people
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:04.580]   have mutations in Factor V Leiden, a clotting factor.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.980]   Fewer people are, as we say, homozygous,
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.940]   have two deficient copies, mutant copies, I should say.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.940]   But there are many people out there
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.900]   that have one mutant copy of Factor V Leiden.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.700]   And my understanding is that oral contraception in females
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.580]   can really exacerbate the Factor V Leiden mutation.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:25.580]   Do you suggest that people get their Factor V Leiden
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.440]   genetics analyzed?
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.160]   I mean, it's pretty inexpensive to do, right?
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.420]   I think on a standard blood test,
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.680]   you can just ask for the Factor V analysis.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.820]   And it's not like a really in-depth thing.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.660]   You don't have to fly to somebody that's a-
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.500]   - Yeah, it's a blood test.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.660]   - Yeah, you don't have to fly to another country,
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.820]   you know, like you do for many things.
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.540]   - It's important to say that's not the norm, right?
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.020]   Like that's not the recommendation.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.140]   When you're talking about putting somebody
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.600]   on the birth control pill,
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.460]   you want to make sure they don't have high blood pressure
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.060]   'cause it can increase their blood pressure.
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.700]   You want to make sure they don't smoke cigarettes
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.620]   because the combination of the pill and cigarette smoking
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.540]   can increase the risk of a stroke.
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.340]   But the recommendation is not to screen them
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.140]   to see if they have any inherited clotting disorders.
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.540]   That said, if you ever have a blood clot
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.940]   on the birth control pill,
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.220]   'cause you're traveling on a plane
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.020]   or you're just on the pill or you're living your life,
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.160]   you're now gonna get this extensive workup
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.100]   to find out if you do have that.
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.020]   It's by no means wrong, and specifically you should,
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.460]   if anybody in your family has ever had a DVT,
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.420]   so a deep vein thrombosis, so a blood clot in their leg,
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.780]   or a pulmonary embolism or a PE,
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.180]   so anybody in your family has had one of those,
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.740]   you should 100% get worked up for clotting disorders.
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.660]   And if you have something, like you carry Factor V,
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.860]   you should no longer take the birth control pill.
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.940]   And specifically the pill, because it's an oral pill
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.300]   and how it's metabolized in the liver
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.820]   is actually what is causing the change
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.900]   in those clotting factors
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.820]   because that's where they're made as well.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.900]   So it doesn't mean you can't take any form of contraception,
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.300]   but we do wanna make sure
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.580]   that we counsel you appropriately.
