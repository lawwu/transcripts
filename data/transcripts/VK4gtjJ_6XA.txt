[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   the right way to do a business while you have a job is to make sure you're doing it the
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.400]   right way.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.480]   And I think the only thing I see going wrong in people's lives is I've seen people get
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.480]   fired from their jobs when they don't disclose that they have a side hustle.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.740]   And I think it like eats at your soul a little bit to not live in the light.
[00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.600]   And so as an owner of a business, I think personally, if people are working in my business
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.720]   and on my business, and really they're like focused on something else, they want to be
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.720]   doing something else.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.660]   And remember, when you own a business in the future, you will be the person with employees
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.120]   that might be distracted.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.280]   So I always kind of push people to think like you already are an owner and then ask yourself,
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.520]   what would you want your employees to do?
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.520]   That's my only caveat to side hustles these days.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.200]   I think those sites where people have like, you know, the Reddit sites where they have
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200]   400 different jobs.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.360]   And, you know, these people who talk about having 37 side hustles, I actually think it
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.460]   makes you distracted, it makes you less happy, and it often makes you less money.
