[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   These foundation models are world models of a kind, and to do really creative problem solving,
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.000]   you need to start searching. So if I think about something like AlphaGo and the move 37,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.320]   the famous move 37, where did that come from? Did that come from all its data that it's seen
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.960]   of human games or something like that? No, it didn't. It came from it identifying a move as being
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.720]   quite unlikely, but possible. And then via a process of search, coming to understand that
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.920]   was actually a very, very good move. So to get real creativity, you need to search through spaces
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.440]   of possibilities and find these hidden gems. That's what creativity is. I think current
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.920]   language models, they don't really do that kind of a thing. They really are mimicking the data.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.200]   They are mimicking all the human ingenuity and everything, which they have seen from all this
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.960]   data that's coming from the internet, that's originally derived from humans. If you want a
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.560]   system that can go truly beyond that and not just generalize in novel ways, so these models can blend
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.080]   things. They can do Harry Potter in the style of a Kanye West rap or something, even though it's
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.560]   never happened. They can blend things together, but to do something that's truly creative,
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.920]   that is not just a blending of existing things, that requires searching through a space of
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.000]   possibilities and finding these hidden gems that are sort of hidden away in there somewhere,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.920]   and that requires search. So I don't think we'll see systems that truly step
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.240]   beyond their training data until we have powerful search in the process.
