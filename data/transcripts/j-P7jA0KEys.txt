[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   It is to be found in the Gospel according to St. Luke, in the sixteenth chapter, verses
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   14 and 15.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:24.400]   "And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things, and they derided him.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:32.840]   And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:41.320]   hearts, for that which is highly esteemed amongst men is abomination in the sight of
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.120]   God.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.020]   The Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things, and they derided him.
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:58.880]   And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:08.400]   hearts, for that which is highly esteemed amongst men is abomination in the sight of
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.400]   God."
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:19.000]   Once more, we are looking at these characters, these people who appear so prominently in
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.080]   the records of the four Gospels, the people who are known as the Pharisees and the scribes.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:37.160]   You cannot read the four Gospels without being impressed by their whole state and condition.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.560]   Some of the severest things that our blessed Lord ever said were said about these people.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:52.160]   Here they are, living in the same land as all others, and they hear about this teacher
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.240]   who suddenly has appeared.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.640]   And at first they crowd out to see him and to listen to him.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.320]   They were motivated by a kind of curiosity, probably, anxious to see him, anxious to hear
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.320]   him.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.320]   Who was this fellow?
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.320]   He had not been to their schools, he was a carpenter, but he seemed to be saying and
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.720]   doing strange things, and the people were crowding after him, so they go out to see.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.220]   But they always sat back, you remember, they were spectators, they sat as it were as onlookers.
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.040]   But they did go, and at first they seemed to be more or less interested and attracted.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.160]   And then they became suspicious, and they began to question him and to argue with him.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.200]   They tried to trip him with their catch questions in order to make him contradict himself, or
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.920]   in order to make him say something which would bring him into trouble with the authorities.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.720]   And then they began to show their active venom and their heart antagonism.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.840]   And in the end it was they who plotted together, you remember, to encompass his death.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.120]   And from the human angle alone, were the people who were most responsible for the death of
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.680]   our blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.720]   In other words, these Pharisees and scribes stand out as the most tragic people in the
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.200]   whole Bible.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.000]   There they are face to face with this blessed Son of God, the Savior of the world.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.360]   And yet, this is the term used, they derided him, they dismissed him, they regarded him
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.720]   with contempt, they had no use for him at all.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.200]   And as I say, it was because of that that our Lord eventually pronounced those terrible
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.640]   woes upon them, which you will find recorded in the twenty-third chapter of the Gospel
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.400]   according to St. Matthew.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:10.120]   Now I am calling your attention to these people because the situation is still the same.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.720]   We are not interested in these matters merely from some theoretical or academic standpoint.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.720]   I am never tired of saying this, the times in which we are living are so urgent and are
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.100]   so cruel.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.800]   We cannot afford just to have theoretical interests or adopt a dilettante kind of attitude.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.800]   My only reason for calling attention to these people and what we are told about them in
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.160]   the Scriptures is that there are so many people who are in precisely the same position at
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160]   this present time.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.680]   They treat the Son of God with derision.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.680]   They are not interested in him.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.240]   They deride him.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:56.760]   They dismiss him, exactly as these people did so long ago.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.740]   Now I feel therefore that it is of vital importance to us to consider them and to consider what
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.960]   our Lord says in various places about them and what we are told about them in the Gospels.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.680]   And in this particular verse, this fifteenth verse in particular, which we are looking
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:20.020]   at this evening, we have what I think we can safely describe as our Lord's final analysis
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.680]   of these people.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.900]   We have considered other things that he has to say about them.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.300]   This is the final thing.
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:35.020]   Here we come really to the root cause of all their other troubles.
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.220]   Here is the ultimate explanation of their derision and their rejection of him.
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.780]   I do not know what you feel, but I know of no verse in the whole Scripture that is a
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.820]   more accurate description of the typical, average, modern person than just this very
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.820]   verse.
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:04.500]   "Ye are they which justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts; for that
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.540]   which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God."
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:17.220]   I know of no verse that speaks more directly to the modern men than just this verse.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.900]   It is such a perfect word to so many in this world this evening.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.300]   What kind of people am I thinking of?
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.500]   Well, let me tell you.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:35.060]   I am thinking of large numbers of people who are not Christians and who tell you quite
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:41.140]   frankly and quite openly that they are not Christians and that they have no use for Christianity.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.820]   They never go to a place of worship.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.380]   They are not interested in it.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:51.060]   They regard that as very old-fashioned, very out of date, something quite outmoded.
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:57.860]   They make no pretense to being religious at all, in any shape or form, but they are good
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.180]   people.
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.500]   When I say that they are good people, I mean this, that they are highly moral, they are
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.860]   very respectable, they do a great deal of good, they have a high standard of morality
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.620]   and of ethics in their personal lives and in their business dealings, and more than
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.620]   that.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.060]   They go out of their way to do good to others and to help others.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.380]   They believe in helping mankind and the uplift of the race, and so on and so forth.
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.280]   Now there are millions of such people in the world tonight.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.940]   They never come near a place of worship, but we must not say for that reason that they
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.900]   are living, as it were, in the dregs of sin.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.900]   Not at all.
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.620]   They are good citizens.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.860]   They pay their debts.
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:51.060]   They avoid the gross, open, ugly forms of sin, and as I say, they are very good and
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.060]   they are very moral.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.660]   There are thousands, millions of such people in the world tonight, but they deride the
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.380]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.580]   They have no interest in him.
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.060]   They don't want to hear about him.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.780]   They are irritated by talk about him.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.940]   They feel that they are perfectly all right without him.
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:15.900]   You see, they are in the exact position of these Pharisees and scribes of old.
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:22.480]   But unfortunately, I fear it is the simple truth to say that these people are not only
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.540]   found outside the church.
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:33.020]   Are there not such people within the church also?
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.700]   Because you see, it is possible to be highly religious and still to be like this, and to
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.140]   conform to this description.
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:49.060]   There are many who are troubled and offended by certain aspects of the Christian faith,
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.700]   even though they do attend places of worship.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:58.340]   They are interested in the life of Christ and in his teaching.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:04.340]   But if you begin to talk about his blood, they become irritated and they begin to show
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.980]   their derision.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:11.100]   They are interested in him only until he goes to the cross, and they see no meaning
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.780]   in that and see no need for that.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:20.540]   They don't like this talk about being born again and the absolute necessity of it, and
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.740]   that we are lost and that we are sinners.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.100]   They resent that.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.380]   They feel that that is insulting, because they have always been good people and have
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.260]   always gone to a place of worship.
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.980]   They see no need to regard themselves as sinners.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:43.020]   Very well, they obviously belong to precisely the same category.
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:48.380]   So you see that this description is a very comprehensive one.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:57.300]   And here, in this astonishing statement, our Lord makes an analysis of these very people.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:04.900]   It is always to me a matter of great interest to notice the people who are unconscious Pharisees.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.180]   Nobody likes to be called a Pharisee.
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:12.340]   Everybody has agreed in denouncing the Pharisees and scribes of the New Testament.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:18.740]   And yet, oh, how often is that done by people who are typical Pharisees and scribes themselves.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.540]   You see, those people outside the church would say, "Well, we can't be Pharisees because
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.940]   we are making no profession."
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:29.340]   Ah, but you see, what makes one a Pharisee is not to make a profession.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:36.420]   What makes one a Pharisee is to deride Christ and to see no need of Him.
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:42.880]   So whoever is in that position is a Pharisee, whatever may be true about us in other senses
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.880]   and in other respects.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:53.260]   Now, here I say our Lord gives his final analysis of these people and of this attitude.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:11:00.940]   And as we read it, we cannot but be impressed by the force and the strength of his language.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.660]   Did you notice what he said?
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:11.540]   He said, "That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God."
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.140]   What strong language!
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.700]   What a powerful term to use!
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:20.700]   Well, I say it is but the introduction, the prelude as it were, to those terrible woes
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:26.340]   that he pronounced upon them just a little bit later when he said, "Woe unto you, scribes
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.420]   and Pharisees, hypocrites!"
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:35.460]   And he expressed his final sense of hopelessness with respect to them.
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.060]   Indeed, we can say this.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:44.500]   There is no class, there is no body of people in the New Testament that are regarded as
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:50.440]   utterly and finally hopeless save this type of person.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:56.380]   We saw last Sunday night that there is an abundant hope for the publican and the sinner.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:02.100]   Our Lord said to these selfsame Pharisees a bit later on that they had rejected the
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:08.380]   preaching of John the Baptist and his preaching, but he says, "The harlots and the sinners
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.460]   are crowding into the kingdom."
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.220]   Indeed, we get the selfsame thing here.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.860]   You remember he said, "The law and the prophets were until John.
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:22.160]   Since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it."
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.160]   But not these people.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:29.520]   No, they are the only people who are finally hopeless, and that is what makes this theme
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.280]   such an important one for us all.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:39.280]   This is the thing that finally keeps one outside the kingdom of God.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:48.280]   This is the thing that finally leads to hell, to have the attitude, the spirit of a Pharisee.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.760]   This thing which makes people deride the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.880]   Well, what is wrong with it?
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.800]   Well, let me put our Lord's analysis through.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:02.400]   He puts it, you notice, under three main headings.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.560]   The first thing that he tells us about these people is that they have the wrong standard.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:16.320]   "Ye are they," he says, "which justify yourselves before men, but God."
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.760]   You see, they have got a wrong standard.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.080]   They start in the wrong position.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.320]   Now, this is, of course, of the very essence of their trouble.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.240]   The Pharisees and scribes, as I have reminded you, were very religious men.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.440]   They were the religious teachers.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:39.700]   They were men who were regarded by others and revered by others as holy men of God.
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:46.240]   They set themselves up as such, and they were accepted as such by the common people.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.440]   The Pharisee was regarded as a menopause.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:54.280]   Indeed, the very name which he uses suggests a separatist in that sense, because he believed
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.760]   that he was a holy man and a teacher.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:07.040]   And yet you see that our Lord says that all they had and all they were was not only wrong
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:13.840]   and useless, but an abomination in the sight of God.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.560]   This is, I say, the most amazing thing that our Lord ever said.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.560]   "Well, what was the matter with them?" you say.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.200]   Well, I say, it was this.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.040]   They were simply conforming to a human standard.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.640]   That is the operative word here.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:34.720]   "Ye are they that justify yourselves before men."
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.400]   Their standard is absolutely wrong from beginning to end.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.000]   It was their own standard.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.040]   Now, our Lord deals with this at great length in the Sermon on the Mount, recorded, you
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.280]   remember, in chapters 5, 6, and 7 of the Gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.200]   That is the whole point of that great sermon.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.040]   It was just to show that these people had been setting up their own standard instead
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.180]   of God's standard.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:04.500]   And because of that, they were satisfied with it, and they satisfied others.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.000]   They believed they were good, they were righteous, they were holy.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.960]   Everybody else believed it about them, and yet our Lord says it is an abomination in
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.960]   the sight of God.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:13.960]   Why?
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.960]   Well, it is not God's standard.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:21.200]   Now, I read to you at the beginning that portion from the tenth chapter of Paul's epistle
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.960]   to the Romans, because the apostle works out the self-same argument just there.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.200]   He is talking about his fellow countrymen, the Jews.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.800]   He says that he has got a continual heaviness and sorrow in his heart for his countrymen.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.360]   What is the matter?
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:41.580]   Well, he says, "I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:47.720]   to knowledge, for they, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:52.960]   establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.960]   of God."
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.060]   It is the same thing.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:05.920]   You see, the tragedy of these Pharisees was that they set up their own standard, and because
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.000]   they conformed to that, they thought that all was well, and they persuaded others that
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.680]   all was well.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:18.960]   But the whole time, it is quite wrong, it is utterly useless.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.520]   Indeed it is abomination in the sight of God.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:30.160]   Well, now, my suggestion this evening is that this is the perfect description of so many
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:36.240]   of men and women at this present time, and it has been increasingly the trouble for the
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.080]   last hundred years.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:45.640]   Why is it, I ask, that the masses are outside the Christian Church?
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.320]   Why is it that the vast majority of men and women in this country are not doing what you
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.040]   are doing at this moment?
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.920]   What is the explanation of it?
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.720]   Why is it that they are not at all interested in Jesus Christ and his coming into this world
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.400]   and his death upon a cross?
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.440]   Their attitude is, "I couldn't care less."
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.400]   Though their world is as it is this evening, and though this confronts them, they are not
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.400]   a bit interested.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.680]   They smile at it.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.000]   They curl up their lips and are rather sorry for those who are still interested in its
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.040]   sob stuff, and so on.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:29.200]   It is dismissed with derision and with sarcasm, and Christ, the name is only used as an oath,
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.280]   as a curse, or as an epithet of abuse.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.280]   What is the matter?
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.280]   Well, you know, there is really no explanation but this very explanation that our Lord gives
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.800]   here.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.960]   They are living according to a standard that they have set up themselves, and they think
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:55.200]   that that is perfectly right, that it is absolutely sufficient, and that nothing more can be desired.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.200]   You see, everybody has got a standard.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.280]   There is nobody in the world but that he or she has got some standard.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:08.960]   Do you know anybody outside the Christian who does not always justify himself?
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.320]   Have you ever found a man or a woman really to admit that they are all wrong?
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.280]   No, no, they put up a marvellous case.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.600]   It is the other person.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:21.400]   There is nobody that I know who cannot try to justify himself.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.200]   Everybody has got his standard.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.120]   Everybody has got his kind of code.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.600]   There is such a thing as even honour among thieves.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.480]   There are certain things they will not do.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.520]   There is a kind of code that runs amongst them.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.840]   They do not rob one another, and to rob one another is a terrible thing in their sight.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.400]   They would be horrified at a man who does that sort of thing.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.640]   They would say, "He is a cad.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.040]   He has let the side down.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.880]   He is not true."
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.600]   You see, everybody has a standard, yes, but the question is, what is the standard?
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.600]   Whose standard is it?
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:59.960]   It does not matter how high the standard is, how low the standard is.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:05.480]   All men have got their standard, they have got their ideas, and they have got their codes
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.880]   and their systems.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.200]   Some I say are very low, but others are very high.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.600]   There are great philosophies.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.720]   There are systems of thought.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.040]   There are codes of morality and of ethics.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.520]   There are people who do not put it, perhaps in as formal a way as that, but they are very
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.320]   concerned about these things.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:31.240]   The honour of a gentleman, certain things which a gentleman does not do, and other things
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.360]   which every gentleman always does, and they sooner die than break that code.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.560]   That is what they believe in, and they believe in it with all their being, and they live
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.560]   up to it.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:48.440]   It is their standard, and it may be a very high one, as I say.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:54.880]   There is great idealism amongst many people, and moral elevation.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.360]   But you notice what our Lord says?
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.480]   He is not merely talking about those with a low standard, he is talking about those
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.120]   with the highest standard conceivable.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:13.120]   He says that which is highly esteemed amongst men is abomination in the sight of God.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:19.200]   What he says, in other words, is this, that the highest view of life held by men tonight
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.560]   outside this book is an abomination to God.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:28.880]   Now, that is a very startling and a very striking statement.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:35.480]   And you notice that our Lord says that the reason for it is this, that it is the wrong
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.120]   standard.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.380]   It is not the standard that God has given.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.360]   My dear friend, what matters first and foremost is not the sort of life you are living.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.920]   It is no part of the preaching of the gospel to criticize that.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.800]   Let me grant you this.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.240]   You tonight listening to me who are not a Christian, you may be a very much better person
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.400]   as judged from sheer conduct than many who call themselves Christians.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.360]   I will grant you that.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.240]   But you see, that does not solve any problem.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.840]   That does not answer any question at all.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:15.000]   For the vital question is the question of standard.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.760]   Whose standard are you conforming to?
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.820]   According to what ideas are you living?
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.880]   The ultimate question, you know, rarely comes down to this.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.560]   It is the question of authority.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:37.080]   And in the last analysis there are only two possible standards and two possible authorities.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:45.360]   We either take our authority and our sanction and our standard from this book, or else we
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.880]   take it from men.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.160]   There is no other possible alternative.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.720]   It is just that.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.920]   Every other system, I do not care as I say whether they are high or low, whether they
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.800]   are philosophical or ignorant, all of them are in the same compartment.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.560]   They belong to men.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:08.600]   And we, all of us, are basing our total view of life tonight on one of those two things.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:14.040]   I either take a human standard, my own and other men's, what I read in books, what
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:21.160]   I read in newspapers, or else I take it from this book.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:26.040]   This book claims to be a revelation from God.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:31.960]   It does not offer itself to us as men's opinion or as men's standard.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.640]   This is a book which says, "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.920]   The Lord God called Moses up to a mountain and addressed him and spoke to him and gave
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.200]   him ten commandments.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.400]   Moses never said that he had thought them out.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.560]   He said, "I received them from God."
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.040]   And it is the same with all the book.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.800]   It is a revelation from God.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.760]   So you see, the question rarely becomes as simple as this.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:02.360]   As I think of myself and of my life in this world and of my death and my future, do I
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:10.440]   come to conclusions, do I make my assessment entirely in terms of this, or is it what I
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.040]   think and what others think?
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.520]   Do I come to this and say, "Very well, I recognize that that is the word of God, the
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.560]   word of the Lord, and whatever I may think and others may think, I'm going to submit
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.960]   myself to that."
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.960]   Is it God?
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:25.960]   Is it myself?
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.960]   Is it men?
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.160]   "Ye are they that justify yourselves before men."
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.800]   And isn't that what they are all doing tonight?
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:41.040]   They say, "Of course, there is no need to go to a place of worship.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.280]   There is no need to go together to worship God on Sunday."
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.160]   "No, no," they say, "all that sort of thing, of course, belongs to the past.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.880]   It is not really necessary."
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.360]   They say, "There is no need to believe this theology about Jesus Christ as the Son of
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:24:00.280]   God, born of a virgin, with two natures in one person, and that when he died on the tree,
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.360]   God was there punishing sin, your atonement and things."
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.680]   "No, no," they say, "it is unnecessary."
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:15.240]   All that is necessary, they tell us, is this, is that you live your code, that you live
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:21.000]   up to your standard, that you are a good man and an honest man, and a moral man and a kind
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.320]   man, and a philanthropic person and an idealist.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.720]   They say that is all, and nothing else is necessary.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.600]   And it is as good to spend your day at home reading Sunday newspapers, if you happen to
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.760]   have them, or reading something else, or listening to a wireless, looking at the television.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.640]   "Ah," they say, "all this belongs to the infancy of the human race."
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.240]   And they believe it, and they are happy about it, and they are confident, they justify the
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.760]   life they are living, they satisfy themselves, they satisfy others.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:57.320]   Isn't that the position?
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.880]   And what God has said is not even considered.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.640]   It is not considered at all.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:09.600]   As the Pharisees erected their own system, the modern man is doing the same.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.520]   Oh, how surprised he would be if he thought that he was a Pharisee, but you see he is
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.880]   in the identical position.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:22.520]   The essence of the Pharisaical position is that you put up man's standard instead of
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.520]   God's standard.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.960]   That is the first trouble.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.080]   Let me hurry to the second.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.600]   The second thing our Lord tells us about these people is that they are ignorant of God's
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.600]   standard.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.720]   They set up their own, and very largely because they are ignorant of God's.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:53.880]   "Ye are they which justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts."
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:26:03.000]   And there you see we are face to face with this great and striking contrast at once.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.320]   This I suppose was the ultimate tragedy of the Pharisees, that they in their blindness
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:15.200]   and in their sin rarely did think that they were concerned about God's righteousness.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.200]   But they were not.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:21.240]   They were establishing their own, and they had substituted God's by their own.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:27.320]   Their own interpretation was given the place of God's Word, and thus they went astray
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.480]   and led others astray with them.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:37.080]   And that, of course, is why the Pharisees rejected Christ.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.880]   They had never seen God's standard.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:46.640]   And my friend, let me put it as plainly and as bluntly and as simply as this.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:53.320]   There is only one final explanation why people do not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.360]   it is this.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:00.840]   They have never realized God's standard.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.840]   It is the only reason.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.080]   There is no other.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:10.280]   If any person ever realizes who and what God is and His relationship to Him, I will guarantee
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:15.240]   you that such a person will fly to Christ.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:20.260]   People do not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ because they do not see any need of Him.
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:24.840]   If they saw any need of Him, they would very soon avail themselves of Him.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.360]   People always go for that which they need and that which they want.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:33.360]   If people are in a house on fire and you produce a fire escape, you will not need to persuade
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.120]   them to rush to it and to get down it.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.120]   No, no.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.480]   If a man is desperately ill and you say, "Now there is a new drug that cures that," it is
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.480]   very expensive.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.960]   He says, "I do not care what it costs.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.720]   I will pawn my last possession.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.600]   I must have it if it will cure me."
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:52.680]   When a man realizes his need, he will jump at the remedy.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:58.040]   And there is only one final explanation of why people do not believe in Christ.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.080]   They have never seen the need of Christ and that is because they have never realized the
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:07.920]   nature of God's holy and eternal standard.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.000]   And you see, this is the preaching of the gospel.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   It starts with the law.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.640]   We have got to see our need.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.920]   Oh, not merely a need to be delivered from some particular trouble or some particular
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:22.880]   problem but my need face to face with God's demands and God's standard.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   What is it?
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:32.120]   "God seeth the heart."
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.520]   And here we are given our Lord's exposition of sin.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.520]   What is God's standard?
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.620]   Well, let me put it to you like this.
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:45.080]   It is not something, he tells us, that is interested only in the external appearance.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.360]   It is interested in the inner life within.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:54.200]   Oh, do you remember how our Lord put it in a picture one day to these Pharisees and scribes?
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:29:00.720]   He said, "You know, you are those who clean the outside of the cup and the platter, but
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.680]   the inside is full of ravening and of wickedness."
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:11.560]   It is like a person who simply washes the outside of a teacup and never washes the inside.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.520]   And they polish the outside and how marvelous it looks!
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.520]   And then you look inside the cup and you find the dregs of many cups of tea.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.640]   It is filthy.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.240]   But that was the tragedy of the Pharisees.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.640]   They were concerned about external appearances.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.480]   They used to stand on the street corners.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.520]   They were so holy they could not wait until they got to the synagogue.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.240]   They had to pray on the street corner.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.360]   They stood right in the front in the synagogue, you remember, and everybody saw them.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.080]   How holy, everybody said.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.440]   And the Pharisee said the same thing about himself.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:50.360]   He was interested in external appearances.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:58.000]   And this type of person is always interested in the external, the respectability, the appearance.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   How friendly they look.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.200]   Look at them at the dance or at the dinner or at some great civic occasion.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.440]   How they like one another.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.280]   How friendly they appear to be.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.280]   Are they?
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:17.520]   The hypocrisy of it all.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.520]   Interested in externals.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.680]   We talk about our high standards.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.120]   But you get to know these people behind the scenes.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.000]   Listen to their secrets.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.040]   The men they are shaking hands with, so affably, so delighted to see him.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.600]   He is a rival.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.680]   He is someone who is a danger.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:39.520]   And they whisper something through the corner of their mouth to you, even as they are looking
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.520]   at him.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:46.960]   It is interested in externals and in appearances, the brightness and the joviality and the happiness
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.960]   of the world.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.160]   You read it in the social gossip in the newspapers.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.360]   You get it in your books.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.680]   How marvelous the world seems.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:31:00.120]   Ah, but it is only the outside of the cup and the platter.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:07.040]   Their inward parts are full of ravening and of wickedness, the Pharisee.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.360]   Ah, but our Lord, you see, is concerned about the heart.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.360]   God seeth the heart.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:19.440]   Yes, as the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it, the word of God is quick and powerful
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.960]   and is able to divide even to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit and of the
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.800]   joints and marrow.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   And it is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:38.240]   The Almighty God sees you inside as well as outside, and nothing is hidden from the eyes
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.120]   of him with whom we have to do.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.200]   But all things are naked and open.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.600]   That is God's standard.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.000]   But wait, let me go on.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.920]   God is interested not only in actions but in motives.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.120]   God is not interested only in what we do, but he is much more interested in why we do
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.120]   them.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:05.080]   Again, our Lord puts it to the Pharisees in this way.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:10.120]   He says, "You people do your arms in order to be seen of men.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.440]   They were kind to the poor.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.320]   They gave arms to the poor.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:18.760]   Yes, and they were always very careful to do it in such a way that it was seen."
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:23.360]   The real motive, you see, was not to help the poor; it was to get the praise of men.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.360]   And some of them fasted.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:29.560]   They were such good people, yes, but they disfigured their faces in order that they
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:34.320]   might look as men who were suffering greatly in their fasting.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:40.480]   And so on with their prayers, "to be seen of men."
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.160]   God is not interested only in the action but in the motive behind the action.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:50.320]   The reason for the action, and the world today seems to be full of good works and people
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:57.520]   are marvelous and sacrifice themselves, but the question is, why are they doing it?
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.680]   What is their motive?
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.760]   What is their reason?
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.000]   Oh, how easy it is to fool men.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.640]   How easy it is to appear wonderful before men.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.200]   But God knows your hearts.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:13.040]   He knows your secret thought, that twinge of pride, that self-satisfaction that you
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.320]   get.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.000]   He knows all about it and He is as interested in that as in the thing you have done.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   But let me go on.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.200]   He is not only interested in deeds, He is interested in desires.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.880]   You see, the thoughts and intents of the heart.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.440]   You remember how He puts it in the Sermon on the Mount, these people who said, "We
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.680]   have never committed adultery."
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:41.280]   He said, "Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust with her hath committed adultery in
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.280]   his heart."
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.280]   That is God's standard.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.280]   The mere fact that you can say, "I have never done that," does not mean that you
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.280]   are not guilty of it.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.760]   You have done it in your heart and that to God is as reprehensible as the very act itself.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:34:02.280]   "You may not have committed actual murder," He says to these people, "but oh, how many
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.760]   people have you murdered in your heart.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.760]   How many people have you murdered with your tongues and in your spirit.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.280]   It is rank murder.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:14.880]   You have said, 'Thou fool,' you have hated, you have cursed, you have destroyed
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.880]   in spirit."
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:27.080]   God is not only interested in actions and deeds, He is interested in desires.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.760]   But to put it in a phrase, let me put it like this.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:36.960]   The whole of the teaching of the New Testament is this, that what matters is our relationship
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   to God.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.680]   It is not just a question of doing good or not doing sins.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.760]   It is my relationship to God.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.440]   That is God's test.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:50.880]   Of course life is important, morality is essential, and my deeds do matter and they do count,
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.880]   of course.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:57.480]   But you know, these are only indications of my relationship to God.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.320]   That is the thing God is concerned about.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.360]   God has made us for Himself.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.880]   He has made us for companionship and fellowship with Himself.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:11.520]   And what God is interested in is not what I do, but what I think of Him and my relationship
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.520]   to Him.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:17.560]   And He has told me what He expects of me.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.120]   Nobody can be in ignorance about this.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.840]   You remember the man who went to our Lord one afternoon with what he thought was a catch
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:29.320]   question and he said, "Master, which is the first and the greatest commandment of
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.320]   the law?"
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.480]   You see, there were 613 of them and this man, he knew it was a great question of argument
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.400]   and disputation amongst the Pharisees and scribes and lawyers.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.720]   He thought, "Well, now we will hear what He says about this.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.920]   Which is the first and the greatest?"
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.920]   He never expected the answer he got.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.040]   If he had, he would never have asked this question.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.040]   This was the reply.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:36:04.520]   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy mind and all thy soul
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.560]   and all thy strength.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:14.320]   That is the first and the greatest commandment.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.400]   And the second is like unto it.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.760]   Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:28.800]   That is God's standard, my friend.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.120]   Did you come into this building feeling that you were not a sinner?
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.040]   Have you ever resented being told that you were a sinner, that you were a very hopeless
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.320]   sinner?
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.120]   Did that seem to you to be insulting?
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.120]   Did you say, "Well, I am not conscious of this.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.960]   I have never done any wrong.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.680]   I have never been guilty of these things.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.320]   I have always done my best."
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:53.120]   Have you resented the biblical suggestion that you were a sinner?
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:57.600]   Well, if you have, until tonight I don't think you ever will again, will you?
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.280]   Because this is what God asks of you and of me and of everybody.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.280]   "Thou shalt love" – love?
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.680]   Not simply do certain things.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:14.880]   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart" – complete, totalitarian
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:23.240]   – "and all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy strength."
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:26.000]   Are you doing it?
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Can you say that you have done it?
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.240]   Is the whole of your being loving God without any reservation?
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.640]   If it isn't, you are a vile sinner.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.360]   You have hopelessly failed to reach the standard.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.480]   What is the standard?
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.480]   Nothing less.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.480]   Every other standard you mention to me is a standard of men.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.600]   You are justifying yourselves before men.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.300]   That is what God asks.
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.960]   This is God's own law.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.200]   It comes from the mouth of his only begotten Son.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.880]   That is what God demands of every one of us.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:02.480]   And I don't care whether you have been guilty of adultery or murder or not.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.640]   If you haven't loved God like that, you are as much a sinner as the adulterer and
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.720]   the murderer.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.560]   Because that is God's standard and nothing else.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.560]   It isn't mere actions.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:23.080]   It is the whole, total state of your heart relative to God.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:28.520]   And the trouble with these Pharisees, as it is with their modern counterparts, is that
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.280]   they never realize that.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.840]   They set up their own standard.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.920]   They are ignorant of God's standard.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:40.760]   And lastly, for me to close, this attitude doesn't realize that what is perfect according
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:46.600]   to its standard is abomination according to God's standard.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:51.320]   "Ah, but surely, sir, someone that is too strong.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.480]   Surely this can't be abomination.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:57.200]   Surely sir, someone, you are not going to tell me."
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:07.880]   That a man who spends his life in reading the philosophers in order to extract the highest
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:14.040]   and the noblest and best ideas with regard to life and living, and who rarely does his
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:18.400]   utmost to put them into practice, a man who doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, he gives
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.520]   his goods to the poor, he spends his life in doing good and in helping others and in
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:29.480]   elevating noble thought, surely, you say, you can't call a man like that an abomination
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.400]   in the sight of God.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:40.840]   Well, the Son of God does, and I can tell you why.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:49.000]   He is an abomination in the sight of God for this good reason, that what he is guilty of,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.440]   his attitude, is the very essence of sin.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.560]   God hates sin.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.720]   God abominates sin.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.880]   God is of purer eyes even than to look upon sin.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.800]   He can have no dealings with it.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:15.120]   It is utterly abhorrent to him, and the very essence of sin is this position of the Pharisee.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:22.200]   You see, it was the position of the devil, its pride, its self-sufficiency.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.640]   It is rebellion against God.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.080]   It is ultimately a hatred of God.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:36.000]   I am going to show you in a few words that this attitude towards God is the greatest
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.440]   insult that one can ever offer to God.
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:49.280]   It insults him everywhere because it doesn't seek to glorify him always and in everything.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.480]   How does this attitude insult God?
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.720]   Well, listen.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:02.480]   It insults him in the first place because it disputes his lordship and his majesty.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.960]   It doesn't submit to God and his standard.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:09.360]   It doesn't even submit to his right as the lawgiver and as the one who has the right
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.140]   to lay down the terms and the conditions.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.920]   It does the very thing that the devil did at the beginning.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.240]   He raised himself against God.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.680]   He says, "Now God says that.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.680]   I say."
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:26.000]   Do you remember how he tempted men at the first?
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.920]   "Hath God said what a writer's got to say?"
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.440]   Don't listen to him.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.440]   Listen to me.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.440]   Set up your own standard.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:38.280]   Why should God dictate?
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.760]   And my dear friend, it comes to this.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:48.640]   If your view of life is not based on this book, the Bible, that is your position.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:54.240]   You are setting up your idea, your opinion, the opinion of men, as against God's opinion.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.760]   That's all.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.640]   And that is the greatest insult you can ever offer to God.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.760]   You are insulting his lordship, his majesty.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.680]   Not just the eternal lawgiver.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.680]   But wait.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:10.520]   You are also insulting his greatness and his power.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:17.760]   You are insulting God by suggesting that he will not and he cannot do what he has said
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.160]   so plainly he will do.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.680]   You confront the modern man with the Bible and God's law and he will smile at you and
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.920]   he will say, "I am not to be frightened by that sort of thing."
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.920]   He doesn't care.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.960]   "Who is God?" he asks.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.960]   This is my view.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:35.960]   This is what I think.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.120]   This is what I say.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.280]   And he is defying the almighty God.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.880]   There is no fear of God before their eyes.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.040]   The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God."
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:50.920]   He sets himself up and he defies whatever God's may be.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:57.040]   Can't you see the insult involved in it?
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.280]   Can't you see why it is abomination in the sight of God?
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:06.360]   That men try to brush God aside in spite of his eternal greatness.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:12.640]   But you see, they insult his holiness in exactly the same way, in this way.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:17.280]   A man who says that his efforts are good enough to bring him to the presence of God is insulting
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.280]   God's holiness.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.880]   He says, "What I say is this.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.640]   As long as a man does do his best and so on, nothing more can be required."
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.920]   And he can only say that because he is ignorant of God's holiness.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:35.200]   He doesn't realize that God is light and that in him is no darkness at all.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:40.440]   He doesn't realize that you can't mix sin with God's unutterable holiness and absolute
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.640]   perfection.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.660]   He insults God's majesty.
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.280]   He insults God's power.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:49.960]   He insults God's holiness.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:57.600]   He insults God's grace and love and mercy and compassion because he sees no need of
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.600]   it.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:02.520]   The self-sufficient modern man doesn't believe in the death of Christ on the cross because
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:03.720]   it is unnecessary.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.200]   He doesn't need any help.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.600]   He is doing it all himself.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:10.920]   He is such a good man and it is an insult to him to tell him that he is a sinner who
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.480]   needs to be saved.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.680]   And what he is really doing is this.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:19.720]   He is hurling God's gift back into the face of God.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:23.800]   He is deriding it.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:28.640]   Is it surprising that our Lord talks about it as an abomination in the sight of God?
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:34.440]   But oh, let me put it in one word.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:40.720]   I'll tell you why this attitude is an abomination in the sight of God at its best and highest.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:46.480]   In its most noble good pagan, in its greatest philanthropist in the world at this moment,
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:54.600]   I'll tell you why God regards it as an abomination, as something vile and foul.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:45:05.760]   It is because it dismisses his only begotten, dearly beloved Son.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:11.960]   It is because it dismisses his leaving the courts of heaven and being born as a babe
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:15.440]   in Bethlehem and sees no point in it and no purpose.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.960]   It is the greatest act that the world will ever know.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:25.120]   It means nothing to it.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:36.360]   Then supremely, when God laid on him the iniquity of us all, and he in the garden of Gethsemane
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:42.960]   in his agony is sweating drops of blood, it sees no purpose in it.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:49.040]   And if I may use such language, the very heart of God was breaking and bleeding as this horrible
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:55.440]   thing called sin comes between God and his own Son, and the Son cries out, "My God,
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.320]   my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:05.600]   This attitude sees nothing in it and dismisses it and derides it.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:15.440]   The supreme act of God's love, the final manifestation and unveiling of his holy heart,
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:26.320]   it has no use for it, no interest in it, because of its self-satisfaction and its self-sufficiency.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.520]   That is why it is an abomination in the sight of God.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:37.280]   "He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father that hath sent him."
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.840]   Oh, my dear friend, where do you stand?
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:45.160]   Don't think of your actions for a moment, don't think of your life, your good deeds.
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:50.920]   Face this one question.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:57.400]   Do you think that you are good enough to stand in the presence of God in and of yourself?
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:05.960]   If you do, you are an abomination in the sight of God and you will be treated as such.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:09.040]   Or wait.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:15.160]   Do you think that by further effort you can make yourself good enough, either to please
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:18.080]   God or to become a Christian?
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:22.760]   Do you say, "Well, now I am convinced by that, I admit that that is God's standard,
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.160]   and I am going to make another mighty effort"?
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.160]   Are you?
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:32.800]   If you are, that is also an abomination in the sight of God, because God has told us
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:37.300]   once and forever that all our efforts will never be enough and that they are unnecessary
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.000]   because he has done it all.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.080]   Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.080]   He offers it all.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:51.280]   Lastly, here it is.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:57.920]   Do you see the absolute necessity of the coming of God's Son into this world in order to
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.560]   save you?
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:07.360]   Do you see the absolute necessity of his death upon the cross before God can forgive you?
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:12.560]   Do you see that that was God's way of making forgiveness possible for you?
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:20.960]   Do you see face to face with God's standard that you are utterly and completely hopeless,
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:25.000]   but that because of that Christ came in order to redeem you?
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.840]   If you do, you are blessed in the sight of God.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:34.120]   If you do not, you are an abomination in the sight of God.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:39.960]   And the better you are, the more moral you are, the greater is the abomination, that
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:44.160]   which is highly esteemed amongst men.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:55.360]   All it must of tonight is abomination in the sight of God, because it dismisses the very
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.640]   heart of God himself.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:06.160]   And that leads, my dear friend, to nothing but hell and perdition and suffering and endless
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.560]   remorse.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:15.000]   God forbid that anybody who has listened to my words this evening should experience such
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.440]   a fate.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:28.200]   Face God's standard and fly to Christ and cast yourself at his feet and say, "Nothing
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:50.560]   in my hand I bring, simply to thy cross I cling."
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:50:17.360]   Amen.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:24.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
