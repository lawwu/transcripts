[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   Roger Olson is professor of theology at George W. Truitt Theological Seminary, Baylor University
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.640]   in Waco, Texas.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.660]   Olson is an Armenian theologian, and recently on his blog he called for Armenians to find
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.920]   something of their own John Piper to spearhead a robust Armenian theology, someone to capture
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.620]   the attention of young Christians today.
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.360]   In speaking of you, Pastor John, Olson writes this, quote, "Unfortunately, Armenians have
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.200]   not produced such a spokesperson in recent decades," end quote.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.160]   He goes on to say, quote, "Much of the blame for the rise of New Calvinism is ours, Armenians.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.280]   We have failed to provide our young people with our theology," end quote.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.920]   But is it as simple as finding their own version of John Piper, finding a leading spokesman
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.160]   to spread their theology, or is there something more fundamental in Armenian theology that
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.520]   undermines passionate and persuasive preaching?
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.640]   What would you say to questions like these, Pastor John?
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:02.120]   Well, there have been some very passionate and persuasive and powerful preachers of Armenian
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.760]   theology.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.760]   John Wesley, Charles Finney, Francis Asbury, and lots of influential preachers in our day
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.840]   who are not Calvinists.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.400]   Some of them are so doctrinally indifferent, and this is what Roger Olson is concerned
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.280]   about, they're so doctrinally indifferent that they would not want to be known as Armenians
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.280]   either.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.480]   They don't want to be known by any doctrinal label, and they don't focus on doctrine.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.000]   They're always trying to be practical.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.840]   They're always trying to avoid controversy, and frankly, I think that makes them really
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.800]   effective entertainers and very ineffective shapers of the theology of the world, which
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.720]   is what lasts in the long run and shapes a culture and guides a people.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.640]   Jesus is so glorious that even if you have only a partial view of his greatness, which
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:06.200]   is what all of us do, or even a distorted view, he is enough to thrill you and empower
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.400]   your preaching if you're sensitive to his greatness.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.960]   I say that because I don't want to be so naive as to say the only people that can have passion
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.960]   for Jesus is Calvinists.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.400]   That's just not true.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.120]   Anyone who sees a part of Jesus and the other part they may have a distorted view of—that's
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.600]   what I think Armenian does.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.480]   It has a distorted view, just like they think I have a distorted view of part of Jesus—there's
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.500]   enough that they're seeing that they're blown away by.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.000]   So that I would be the last person, I hope, to say that a person who doesn't share my
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   full-blown Calvinistic theology can't have a rich, deep, powerful, amazed, worshipful
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.200]   relationship with Jesus because he is so great and so glorious, if you just capture a fragment
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.440]   of his truth, it's enough to blow your brains out.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.700]   So I wouldn't want to go the direction of in any way minimizing what God is able to
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:17.300]   do through a person with a fragmented or imperfect view of Christ's glory.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:24.500]   To me, it's never the point to say, "If God blesses some non-Calvinists with power
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.820]   and fruitfulness, and if there are Calvinists who are weak and immature and unkind, then
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.820]   what's the point of theology?"
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.580]   I think a lot of people ask that question.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.100]   If there are effective Armenians and ineffective Calvinists, who cares about theology?
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.620]   Well both Roger Olson and I think that's ridiculous.
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:50.180]   I mean, that's just a bad way to think because I stand with Roger in saying theology does
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.860]   make a difference.
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.460]   One of the things I like about Roger is that he is relentless in believing that theological
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.180]   affirmation should be met with theological affirmations, not with pragmatic reductionism.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.500]   And so I stand watching Roger on the Armenian side pleading for Armenians to wake up and
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.240]   take theology seriously like he does, and I think that's a worthy calling.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.720]   But in answer to your question, is there something more than the absence of some charismatic
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.240]   spokesman or whatever to make Arminianism more effective in our day?
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.840]   I think the answer is yes, there is something more fundamental standing in the way of a
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.380]   great resurgence of Arminianism than the absence of a key voice.
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.840]   And here's what I think it is.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.220]   Arminianism at its essential distinguishing core gives man the final, ultimate, decisive
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.800]   role in who gets saved.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.240]   Let me say that again.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:01.460]   Arminianism at its essential distinguishing core gives man the final, ultimate, decisive
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.760]   role in who gets saved.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:12.160]   This is not the kind of thing that produces wonder and worship.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:19.160]   This essential distinguishing core is not the kind of truth that blows people away with
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.240]   wonder and amazement and worship.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.440]   So let me be more specific.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:32.200]   Calvinists and Arminians both believe that Jesus is the only objective foundation for
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.440]   our imputed righteousness and thus our justification.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.440]   And we both agree that the only instrument that God uses in connecting this work of Christ
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.920]   with the undeserving sinner is faith, which is an act of the human soul.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   It is.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.920]   It's a human act.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.440]   It's an act of the human soul.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.440]   Faith is.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:00.240]   But when the question is asked, what is the final, ultimate, decisive reason why one person
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.440]   has that faith or believes and another doesn't, the Calvinist says, "The sovereign grace of
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.720]   God."
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:17.200]   And the Arminian says, "The free will of man," meaning finally decisive power of self-determination.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.120]   Now I think that is precisely what stands in the way of a great worship gathering, a
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.440]   great worship, God-exalting conference that celebrates the distinctives of Arminianism.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:37.360]   At the core, it is about the powers of human self-determination.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:47.640]   There are worthy efforts among Arminians to make this sound glorious, but in the end,
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.800]   it cannot bear the weight of worship and wonder, I don't think.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.160]   Born-again Arminians truly worship God.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.040]   But here's the interesting thing.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:08.200]   I think born-again Arminians truly worship God not by focusing on their essential distinguishing
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.840]   core but on focusing on the great things they share with Calvinists.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:19.120]   So you read Charles, I mean, you sing Charles Wesley, "And can it be, thine eye diffused
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.960]   a quickening ray, I rose, went forth, and followed thee."
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:32.240]   Calvinists love that song because it so gives God the power to reach into our imprisoned
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.680]   lives and rescue us.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:42.280]   In Arminianism, the core of their theology, I'm talking about that essential distinguishing
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.800]   core, is based on a philosophical presupposition that man cannot be accountable if God has
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.440]   final control of his will.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.480]   It's not based on the Word of God.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.920]   That presupposition is not taught in the Bible.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.600]   I'll say it again.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:03.000]   The philosophical presupposition that man cannot be accountable if God has final control
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.880]   of his will, that presupposition is not taught in the Bible.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.520]   That's brought to the Bible by Arminians from outside.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.960]   And therefore, I don't expect a great God-centered, biblically rich, exegetically rigorous, robust
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.040]   worshiping resurgence of Arminianism.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:26.440]   Its distinguishing core is man-centered and biblically unfounded, and therefore, worshipfully
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.440]   uninspiring.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.460]   And let me end by saying, when I say that, I don't mean, please don't hear me mean that
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:37.240]   Roger Olson or any other Arminian is not a genuine worshiper of God.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:45.960]   I just mean that when that genuine spirit of worship grips any of us, we're not focusing
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:52.480]   on the fact that we have final say in our salvation.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.640]   We're focusing on the glory of the grace of God.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.400]   They are, and we are.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:03.400]   Which is why I think at its core, there's this stumbling block and this governor that's
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:09.920]   going to keep Arminianism from having the kind of resurgence that Calvinism has had.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.920]   Very interesting.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.920]   Thank you, Pastor John.
