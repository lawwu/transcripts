[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.780]   Peter, a podcast listener in Northern Ireland, writes in to ask this.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.320]   My church is good and biblically solid, but has no suitable marriage prospects for a single
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.440]   guy in his early 20s with a strong desire for marriage.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.120]   Pastor John, is this situation an acceptable reason for me to leave my church in search
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.120]   of another?
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.980]   I think if I were talking to Peter, instead of immediately saying yes or no, I would put
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.680]   before him some questions to ask.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.160]   So maybe this will be helpful to him and to others.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.680]   What kind of questions would you ask in trying to make such a decision?
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.080]   Here's number one.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.800]   Do my elders approve of my move?
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.280]   Have they given their counsel?
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.240]   Don't be a Lone Ranger Christian.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.800]   Seek wisdom from those who know you and your situation best.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.800]   That's number one.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.160]   Number two, how much would I be missed?
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.080]   How much harm would I do if I left?
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.400]   How much am I needed here?
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.560]   That would be another question.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.400]   Here's a third one.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.560]   Will I honestly be able to throw myself into the ministry of a new church with an authentic
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.600]   sense that I love the people here and I want to serve them, or will I be tempted to feel
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.760]   like I'm just using these people?
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.440]   I'm just showing up here for reasons that don't have to do with so much of what the
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.120]   church is about in terms of worship and edification.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.240]   I'm really out to find a wife.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.880]   Will you have a clear conscience that you can love those people and throw yourself in
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.880]   there?
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.880]   Maybe.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.040]   Fourth question, have you really exhausted all the proper ways one might connect with
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.940]   Christian young women of your age?
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:02.060]   For example, have you been open with a network of family and friends whom you love and trust
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.660]   them and tell them that you're really open to their suggestions?
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.820]   We don't do arranged marriages in the West, but many good marriages have been partially
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.700]   arranged by other people who know us and know her or him.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.220]   Have you opened yourself to those family and friends that you trust in this way and to
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.620]   that way of thinking about it?
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.340]   Here's the fifth one.
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.100]   If you go to this new church and nothing happens there, will you move again?
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:44.780]   Would that put you into an unhealthy situation of defining your life around wife-seeking?
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.780]   Another question.
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.860]   Have you seriously considered whether you might want her too much?
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.860]   Not that it's bad to want to be married, but ask the Lord to make plain to you, do I want
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.440]   this too much?
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.380]   Is it out of proportion in my life?
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:11.260]   And the final thing maybe is, do I trust the sovereign grace of God to do this for me in
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.920]   his time?
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.540]   There is a proper balance between trusting God to do a thing and taking initiatives that
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.380]   are fitting for a young man to make.
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.500]   So let me circle back up to the beginning.
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.180]   Bottom line, in a healthy and well-led church, which is I think what he's saying he's in,
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.640]   the elders don't run your life.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.880]   That's unhealthy, that's cultic when the elders are too nitpicky about knowing everything
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.880]   you do.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.360]   They don't run your life, but they do care for you and must give an account for your
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.360]   soul.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.000]   So let the input of trusted leaders help you make this decision.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Amen.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.400]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.280]   And for those of you who are struggling with singleness, we recorded an episode a while
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.200]   back titled "How Singleness is Good."
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.020]   It's episode number 170 in the Ask Pastor John series, and it's maybe most easily found
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.800]   in the Ask Pastor John app for the iPhone and the Android.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.480]   Make sure you've updated your app in the last month to get all of the new features, and
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.720]   then scroll through the archive until you find episode number 170.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.440]   We'll be back tomorrow to close out the week with a new episode.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.920]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.520]   Thanks for listening.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.220]   [end]
