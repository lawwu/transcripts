[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.120]   - We talked about our personal finances
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.700]   as people listening, thinking about it,
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.500]   but another important thing is thinking about other's finances
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.440]   and especially, you know, the legacy you leave,
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.540]   the legacy your family leaves.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.020]   You know, you intentionally don't use estate planning
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.880]   as much as financial legacy documents.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.840]   So I'd love to hear that story
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.020]   'cause I think it makes it a little easier.
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.520]   But how do you think people should approach that?
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.640]   And as well as the conversation with their loved ones
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.940]   who maybe aren't thinking about it.
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.640]   - I think when we talk about estate planning,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.760]   it's this big, scary idea,
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.680]   and it's really easy to put that off
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.560]   or not pay attention to it because it seems so complicated.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.880]   And again, let's not forget,
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.920]   when we're talking about estate planning,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.600]   what we're really talking about is what's gonna happen
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.480]   when we or our loved one dies
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.400]   and no one likes to talk about that, right?
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.780]   'Cause you start thinking about what's gonna happen
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.280]   when this important person is gone.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.920]   I like to talk about our legacy documents instead
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.080]   because as opposed to thinking about when someone's gone
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.460]   and no longer with us,
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.560]   I like to approach it as this is the way
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.500]   you're going to stay positively in people's lives, right?
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.800]   By planning appropriately,
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.180]   by doing these financial legacy planning
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.840]   or the financial legacy documents
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.040]   or the medical legal legacy documents,
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.460]   this is so that your impact remains,
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.440]   that you still affect those people you love
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.820]   and that even God forbid,
[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.040]   when you die or a family member dies,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.020]   that that positive effect is still out there in the world
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.320]   for years and years later.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.220]   So this is your mark on the world,
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.820]   but it's a difficult conversation to have.
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.900]   And I especially think for people in our age group,
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.800]   a lot of us are in that sandwich generation
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.300]   where we have young kids,
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.420]   but we also have parents who are getting older.
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.660]   And I'm dealing with this right now with my in-laws
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.860]   who are currently moving.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.320]   It's really hard to talk to your parents
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.800]   about money issues and your money situation.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.500]   So in the book, I talk about a few tactics
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.740]   that help you start these conversations
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.540]   in a way that's non-confrontational.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.520]   So one of my favorite ways to start these conversations
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.060]   is you ask for advice, right?
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.340]   So people are very open to having us ask them for advice.
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.580]   So let's say you actually understand
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.540]   this legacy planning yourself,
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.300]   you actually have a good hold on it,
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.980]   but you want to start broaching it with your parents,
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.820]   the easiest way I say,
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.120]   look, I was thinking about doing a will and maybe a trust,
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.520]   mom and dad, what did you guys do?
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.120]   Like, what should I do with this?
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.200]   It's kind of foggy in my mind, I don't know what to do.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.240]   It's a really great way of assessing where your parents are
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.200]   because then they're gonna feel like
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.040]   they're giving you advice, so they're gonna be open.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.520]   They're not thinking you're like, mom, dad, when you die,
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.680]   what am I gonna get of yours?
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.560]   That's not what you're asking them.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.720]   You're saying, I need to do this for my family,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.860]   what should we do?
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.520]   It's a great way to broach the subject
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.900]   and get a feel for how much thinking they've done on this.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.260]   You may find that they've done tons of thinking about it,
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.780]   they have their wills and their trust,
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.020]   and they can actually tell you and help you do it yourself.
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.340]   Or they might look at you and say,
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.780]   we've never thought about this before,
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.100]   and that's a perfect chance to say,
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.140]   well, I'm doing it, you wanna do this together?
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.060]   It's a great way to start the conversation.
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.320]   That's less than one way to do it.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.020]   Another way I really like to broach the conversation is,
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.680]   being in hospice, I've seen some real tragedies.
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.020]   So it's easy for me to approach my parents and say,
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.660]   you know, I was taking care of this guy,
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.860]   and his mom was sick, and she had Alzheimer's.
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.580]   And the dad had taken over everything,
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.860]   the medical power of attorney,
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.220]   he had taken over the finances for the family,
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.340]   and my patient, he was really happy,
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.980]   his parents were managing all these things
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.220]   because his mom was getting sick
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.000]   and he just wanted to be with his mom.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.940]   Then COVID came along, and all of a sudden,
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.220]   his dad got sick and was on a ventilator.
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.220]   And guess what?
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.080]   I didn't have the financial power of attorney,
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.540]   my patient couldn't pay for his mom's needs
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.700]   because his dad was on a ventilator,
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.380]   and he didn't have any rights
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.940]   to all the financial paperwork,
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.700]   to the checking account, to any of that.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.180]   So I've experienced these things,
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.340]   and I could go to my parents and say,
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.780]   you know what, the funniest thing happened
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.020]   to one of my patients, tell that story,
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.600]   and say, gosh, I hope that kind of thing
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.620]   doesn't happen to us.
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.780]   And so by talking about how other people
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.300]   have had these bad experiences,
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.140]   it's a wonderful way to actually breach
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.420]   the conversation with your loved ones,
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.620]   and it's a real non-confrontational, easy way.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.840]   So that's another way to do it.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.400]   And the last way I really like to do it
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.060]   is to talk about it in terms of legacy.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.780]   So instead of saying, when you die,
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.220]   who's gonna get what stuff of yours,
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.100]   to go to your parents and say,
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.820]   you know what, my kids are young,
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.340]   and I, as well as I want my kids
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.420]   to really remember you the way you are
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.020]   after you're gone.
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.500]   Let's talk about how you wanna be remembered.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.980]   What do you want the kids to have of you?
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.380]   What do you want them to remember?
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.440]   What is your legacy?
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.140]   And a lot of times that leads to talking
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.500]   about things even like property,
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.500]   like mom and dad, every year we take all the grandkids
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.900]   and we go to that cabin that you guys own in Wisconsin.
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.580]   After you die, what should be done with that?
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.960]   Like, do you want us to still do that
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.980]   and think of you every year when we go do this?
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.060]   Do you want us to sell it?
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.340]   What would you want done with this thing?
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.160]   But by framing it in terms of their legacy,
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.100]   I think then you can open up the difficult conversation
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.460]   and make it about celebrating the people
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.500]   we're talking about.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.760]   Because the idea behind this,
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.900]   and no one thinks of it this way,
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.900]   but really estate planning should be a celebration
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.700]   of people's lives, right?
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.660]   We should celebrate with their medical legacy planning,
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.620]   like living.
