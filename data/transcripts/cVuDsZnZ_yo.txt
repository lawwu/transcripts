[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   There's such a negative connotation of being like a baby mama.
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.040]   Why do you think that is?
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.860]   Ever since my ex and I were together and he posted me, it was like, oh, you're a gold digger.
[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.440]   And this is before we even brought Zoe into the world.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.860]   So I feel like people just think that you're kind of out there for what players can offer you.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.360]   Like financially, they label me as a gold digger, a whore, a slut, like all just disgusting things.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.760]   They couldn't be more wrong about me, actually.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.740]   I knew him before in high school.
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.620]   Like my situation is very different.
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.460]   So like having to deal with that publicly was really hard.
