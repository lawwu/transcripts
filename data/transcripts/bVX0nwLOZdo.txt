[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.220]   - Body image and self-glory, that's the theme today.
[00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.880]   Body image, of course, is a preoccupation for many
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.260]   and there are huge dieting and physical training industries
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.880]   in our culture that have been established around us.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.540]   So we have this question from a podcast listener named John
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.600]   who lives and works in Washington, D.C.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.800]   and who wonders about what's really motivating him
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.120]   to get to the gym.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.360]   Here's what John wrote.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.160]   Dear Pastor John, I'm committed to working out at the gym.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.600]   I have over the years become fit because of my consistency.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.600]   My temptation is in making my body a temple of self-glory.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.400]   I want others to be impressed with my looks.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.360]   That's the honest truth, but I never say it that way.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.040]   Few people would.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.200]   At what point does working out cross the boundary
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.400]   between self-discipline and self-glorification?
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.600]   - I'll put my answer in a sentence
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.620]   and then I'll try to unpack it for its implications.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.360]   The discipline of the pursuit of physical fitness
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.000]   becomes sinful self-glorification
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.680]   when it is no longer pursued as a means of,
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.480]   one, overcoming our own sin,
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.640]   two, serving others,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.400]   three, glorifying Christ.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.640]   Now this is a huge issue,
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.880]   both for men and women in our culture,
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.800]   because hour after hour, every day,
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.800]   through advertising and other media,
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.840]   we are being told that to be successful and happy,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.560]   our bodies must have a certain appearance.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.960]   So whether we're talking about the way we dress
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.240]   or the way we do our hair
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.200]   or the way we work out in order to be fit,
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   the Christian needs to be clear
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.240]   about the way Jesus calls us to do this
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.600]   that makes us different from the world.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.800]   And I think he does.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.920]   And what I'm suggesting,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.280]   what I'm suggesting is that there are three ways
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.280]   to measure whether our pursuit of fitness is sinful or not.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.240]   And those three ways are,
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.240]   one, is that pursuit a genuine desire
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.040]   to defeat sin in my own life?
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.200]   Two, is that pursuit of fitness
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.760]   a genuine desire to become more useful
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.680]   in serving the temporal and eternal good of others?
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.040]   Three, is my pursuit of fitness
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.080]   owing to a genuine, expressing a genuine desire
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.080]   to show that Christ is more valuable to me than my looks
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.400]   or my health or my reputation as disciplined?
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.920]   So let's take a look at those one at a time.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.920]   First, is your working out at the gym a strategy
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.520]   for overcoming sin in your life?
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.560]   I believe it can be.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.720]   Paul said that he pummeled his body
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.840]   to keep it in subjection
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.720]   because he knew that there were powerful temptations
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.000]   that come from the flesh to undermine his ministry.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.600]   Now, laziness is one of them.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.080]   Over and over in the book of Proverbs,
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.160]   we are warned against being a sluggard.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.960]   Proverbs 20, verse four,
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.740]   the sluggard does not plow in the autumn.
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.980]   He will seek at harvest and have nothing.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.980]   Proverbs 21, 25, the desire of the sluggard,
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.040]   the lazy bones, kills him for his hands refuse to labor.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.080]   So it is a good thing to exercise and eat and sleep
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.680]   in a healthy way so as to subdue the enslaving impulses
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.960]   of the body, including laziness.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.240]   Paul said in 1 Corinthians 6, 12,
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.920]   "All things are lawful for me,
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.920]   but I will not be enslaved by anything."
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.600]   That's any good thing or any bad thing.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.600]   It is good to exercise in order to defeat
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.860]   the sin of laziness and the love of ease.
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.600]   Now, as soon as I say that,
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.440]   every biblically mature saint realizes
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.440]   that Jesus also warned against boasting
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.080]   in that kind of self-discipline.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.320]   He warned against loving the reputation
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.080]   of being a disciplined person.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.400]   Matthew 6, 16, "When you fast,
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.960]   do not look gloomy like the hypocrites,
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.200]   for they disfigure their faces
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.260]   that their fasting may be seen by others.
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.720]   Truly I say to you, they have received their reward,
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.960]   but when you fast," and fasting here really
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.300]   is any kind of self-denial, right?
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.120]   Fasting from television, and so you don't have a TV,
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.120]   John Piper, whoa, you so proud of that, blah, blah, blah.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.080]   Or fasting from ease, so you're gonna pump iron
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.600]   until you're exhausted, or fasting from food, or whatever.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.500]   Fasting stands here for any kind of self-discipline.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.360]   "When you fast, anoint your head with and wash your face
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.360]   that your fasting may not be seen by others,
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.600]   but by your Father who's in secret,
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   and your Father who sees in secret will reward you."
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.120]   So yes, by all means, let's be disciplined
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.800]   and self-denying in the pursuit of defeating sin
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   in our own lives, and let us be ever alert
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.260]   to the deceitfulness of sin that causes us to boast
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.280]   in the very triumphs over sin,
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.280]   and thus turn triumph over sin into defeat by another sin.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.100]   That's how deceitful we are in our own hearts,
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.540]   which leads now to the second way that we measure
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.760]   whether our pursuit of fitness is sinful.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.760]   Is our pursuit of fitness owing to a genuine desire
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.800]   to become more useful in serving the temporal
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.520]   and eternal good of others?
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.580]   Are you aiming to be fit in order to be faithful?
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.200]   Are you aiming to be healthy in order to be helpful?
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.140]   Is your concern with your looks
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.780]   a concern to love other people better?
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.020]   I've got those underlined in my notes here.
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:58.040]   When the disciples argued about who was the greatest,
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.120]   Jesus said, "If anyone would be first,
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.260]   he must be last of all and servant of all."
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.080]   In other words, instead of mirrors in the gym,
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.800]   there should be big signs on the wall.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.800]   He who would be great must be the servant of all.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.920]   So you wanna be strong?
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.980]   You wanna be fit?
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.360]   You wanna be buff?
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.840]   Are you going to use it to be a more faithful servant
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.600]   of people, or are you out to be seen by others?
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.440]   If you are, that's a damnable attitude,
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.440]   and you're in big trouble.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.720]   That's what Jesus would say.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.040]   He did say it.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.420]   Here's the third criteria.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:48.360]   Is the pursuit of fitness a genuine desire
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.280]   to show that Christ is more valuable to you
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.440]   than your looks or your health
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.160]   or your reputation for being disciplined?
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.160]   Are you seeking to make Christ look great, or only yourself?
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   So here's what Paul said, Ephesians 6:10.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.160]   "Finally, be strong in the Lord
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.240]   and in the strength of His might."
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.140]   In other words, true strength.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:27.140]   It's true strength when we are seeking to be strong
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.400]   in the strength of Christ.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.560]   Not strength in ourselves, but strength in the Lord.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.560]   In other words, our aim at the gym is to be strong
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:46.560]   in a way that makes Jesus look strong.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.920]   We gotta figure that out, or we're gonna be idolaters.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.020]   We're gonna be vain glorious.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.360]   Here's the way Peter put it in 1 Peter 1:24.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.320]   "All flesh is like grass,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.160]   and all its glory like the flower of grass.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.460]   The grass withers, the flower falls,
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.860]   but the word of the Lord remains forever."
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.500]   The point is, in the gym,
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.360]   the glory that people are seeking is like grass.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.800]   It withers, it falls.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.520]   Believe me, this is, believe me, I am 70,
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.520]   and I have been jogging regularly since I was 22.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.440]   It is not a fountain of youth, folks.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.200]   You're gonna sag, you're gonna be wrinkled,
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.720]   you're gonna be splotchy, you're gonna be scaly,
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.240]   you're not gonna be pretty or cool.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.480]   And if you have invested your life in that,
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.340]   oh, it will be, you will look pathetic
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.160]   like all those older folks in Phoenix
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.440]   with their ridiculous tans
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.680]   and their sagging wrinkled skin.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.040]   It's just ridiculous.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.040]   The word of the Lord remains forever,
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.840]   and that word says, "Work out faithfully."
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.680]   That is, work out at the gym to defeat sin in your own life,
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.960]   and work out at the gym to become more useful
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.760]   in serving the temporal and eternal good of others,
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.240]   and work out at the gym, yes, you can,
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.240]   to show that Christ is more valuable, more precious to you
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.480]   than your looks or your health
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.780]   or your reputation for being so disciplined.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.320]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.920]   And John, thank you for the question.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.380]   If you have a question about life for Pastor John,
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.840]   we'd love to read it and possibly respond to it on air.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.040]   Type it out and send it to us in an email.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.680]   You can do this through our online home
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.680]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn,
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.860]   or you can simply email it to askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.920]   Well, is it possible to become legalistic
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.000]   about not being a legalist?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.320]   (chuckles)
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.640]   That's meta, that's Friday.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.080]   I'm Tony, I'll see you then.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.240]   (upbeat music)
