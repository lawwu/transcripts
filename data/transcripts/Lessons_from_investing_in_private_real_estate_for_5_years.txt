[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.560]   Long time no chat.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.760]   I've been busy, very busy focused on marketing.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.760]   Buy this, not that.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.760]   You can pick one up at financialsamurai.com/btnt.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.280]   And the good news is that it made the Wall Street Journal bestseller list.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.600]   It was the only new entrant out of a sea of incumbents to make the list.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.480]   The only person with black hair too, so I feel very, very proud to have made the list.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.940]   But I didn't realize how hard it is to make the Wall Street Journal bestseller list based
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.220]   on so many books that I thought made it, but they actually didn't make it.
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.500]   So I'm really proud of that fact and I will be sharing more about how to become a professional
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.120]   writer in another episode.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.420]   But for this episode, I want to talk about lessons learned after five plus years of investing
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.620]   in private real estate.
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.440]   Private real estate is real estate syndication deals, real estate crowdfunding.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.300]   This is what I've been investing in since the end of 2016 and early 2017 to diversify
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.060]   my real estate portfolio and to earn more passive income.
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.180]   As a 45 year old father of two young children, I got to say being able to invest in real
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.140]   estate passively without leverage has been a godsend.
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.220]   Not everything has worked out well, which is why I want to share this episode.
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.180]   But for the most part, the trend has been great, investing in the long term trend of
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.300]   the heartland of America where real estate valuations are lower and cap rates are higher
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.220]   and net rental yields are higher.
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.120]   I think this trend is going to continue for the next several decades and I want to be
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.300]   on this trend, but there are some bumps and bruises along the way.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.060]   So here are seven takeaways from investing in private real estate for over five years
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.140]   because I had just received in July a huge distribution, relatively huge for me, it's
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.420]   $122,423.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.820]   And that was somewhat of a surprise, but I also knew that I am now in the window, the
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.800]   window of receiving distributions because it's been five years and the fund that I invested
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.700]   in, which had something around 20 investments, is now in the heart of distributing capital
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.300]   back to limited partners over the next probably two years.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.660]   So here are some seven lessons.
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.180]   First, investing is a temporary expense, folks.
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.780]   As I wrote in a previous post, treat your investments as expenses if you want to get
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.780]   richer.
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.220]   Such expenses are there to help take care of you in the future when you no longer want
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.980]   to work or are unable to work.
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.900]   This latest financial windfall has made me feel better about raising a family as we are
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.500]   now in a recession, but hopefully we're coming out of the recession as inflation peaks, mortgage
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.620]   rates come down, things get a little bit better or more hopeful going into 2023.
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.720]   But you never know, it's time, this is a time of uncertainty.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.240]   So my investment expenses from 2016 to 2017 have now turned into a liquid asset.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.940]   And the trend should continue for a couple more years as distributions are paid and reinvested.
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.020]   So really change your mindset.
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.320]   If you want to build more wealth and love to spend, trick yourself into spending as
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.940]   much as possible on investing.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.820]   The more you investment spend, the more you may make.
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.960]   Two, take action on your investment thesis.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.820]   When I initially made my private real estate investments in 2016, 2017, and 2018, I didn't
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.820]   know for certain how Heartland Real Estate would turn out.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.960]   I had come up with a thesis in 2016 after Trump's election victory and proceeded to
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.480]   plow a total of about $810,000 into various funds and individual investments.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.640]   Because I had also come up with the Buy Utility Rent Luxury Real Estate Investing Rule, or
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.020]   BRL, I wanted to continue taking action based on my beliefs.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.320]   Investing in real estate that provided the most utility made sense because now we had
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.700]   a way to easily do so thanks to private real estate investing.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.340]   The thing is, if you come up with a thesis, an idea, and don't act on it, you're wasting
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.460]   your time.
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.760]   You must take risks to earn higher rewards.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.320]   You will lose money along the way.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.480]   That's for certain in any risk asset.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.160]   However, by losing, you will also learn how to diversify your portfolio and hone in on
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160]   better investments along the way.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.920]   This is one of my key points in Buy This, Not That, to think in probabilities, not absolutes.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.440]   If you believe with a 70% probability or greater your investment thesis will turn out correct,
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.160]   I would go with a 100% conviction on that investment idea and buy it or short it, whatever
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.800]   it is you want to do.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.840]   And then know with humility and humbleness that 30% of the time you're going to get it
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.840]   wrong, but that's okay.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.880]   You're going to learn and get better over time.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.800]   The third takeaway from private real estate investing is to give your investments time
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.280]   to compound.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.800]   One of my favorite reasons to invest in private investments is they often take years to pay
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   out.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   This is contrary to the attitude of expecting immediate rewards, the day trader mentality,
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.160]   the short term trader.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.200]   It doesn't work over the long run, folks.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.820]   You want to have your investments compound over time.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.200]   Get that nice IRR, that internal rate of return.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.060]   Most of the private funds I invest in, invest their capital over a two to three year period.
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.860]   And then they plan to pay distributions over a five to 10 year period.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.080]   The longer you can let your investments compound, oftentimes, the greater your overall absolute
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.720]   dollar returns.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.400]   As a real estate investor, your goal should be to buy and hold for as long as possible.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.320]   And the thing is, sometimes it's just hard to hold on, especially when recurring tenant
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.200]   and maintenance issues pop up.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.560]   I couldn't hold on to a property I'd held for 13 years.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.280]   I think it was 13 years.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.200]   Yeah, 13 years, because I just couldn't handle the tenants and the maintenance issues, deferred
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.720]   maintenance issues, the upcoming maintenance issues.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.740]   And also, I was a new father in 2017, and I just wanted to focus.
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.520]   But with private real estate investments, you can easily hold on because once you invest
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.420]   your capital, it's done.
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:21.420]   It's in the hands of the sponsors to make sure that the investment turns out okay.
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.260]   And it has a projected timeline for distributions and so forth.
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.120]   So it's actually much easier to invest for the long term in private investments.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.260]   Because once you make the commitment, you've got to stick to it.
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.760]   The challenge, obviously, is to find the right sponsors and the best real estate deals.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.240]   So you've got to spend your time investigating, researching the sponsors and their track record
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.640]   and their history and their failures.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.920]   Because hopefully they do have failures in the past that you didn't partake in, that
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.340]   they can learn from to make better investments in the future.
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.680]   Once you make a capital commitment to a private investment, you actually tend to forget about
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.500]   it for years.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.920]   It's like a mental burden relief.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.080]   There's something about accumulating more capital, you might feel more pressure to do
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.880]   something with it.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.720]   Money starts burning a hole in your pocket.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:19.520]   If you've ever proposed to someone and got that ring, that ring starts burning a hole
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.760]   in your pocket and you want to propose ASAP because it's just there.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.040]   And if you have a lot of cash in a high inflationary environment, it's losing its purchasing power.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:35.360]   So farming out capital to professionals who are looking out for your best interests, hopefully,
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.360]   does feel good.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.760]   All right, the fourth point.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.280]   To invest easier, think of your capital being in separate buckets.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.960]   The reason why it was relatively easy for me to reinvest 550,000 of my rental house
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.800]   sale proceeds in 2017 into private real estate investments was that the capital came from
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.000]   the same real estate bucket.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.800]   Normally, I would only invest about 50,000 to 75,000 at a time.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.240]   This was literally 10x the amount I was investing in.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:12.840]   However, I had reduced my San Francisco real estate exposure by 2.74 million because that
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.920]   was the selling price of the home.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.080]   800,000 was a mortgage and then the rest was home equity.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.000]   And then obviously there's commissions and taxes and so forth.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.280]   I wanted to diversify and reinvest some of the proceeds back into real estate but elsewhere
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.120]   in America, not San Francisco.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.240]   And I figured if I was only receiving a cap rate of 2.5% in San Francisco, if I could
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:41.040]   find real estate opportunities elsewhere that provided an 8% cap rate, I could reinvest
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:47.860]   a third less capital and still earn the same amount of real estate income.
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.520]   So that's basically what I did.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.880]   I divided the proceeds, 550 to real estate crowdfunding, private real estate investments,
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:02.800]   about 600,000 to stocks and another 500,000 to California AA municipal bonds for that
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.840]   tax-free income.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.520]   By thinking in buckets, you may be able to better asset allocate your capital.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.120]   Think in percentages, not absolute dollars because what you'll find is that the wealthier
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:21.080]   you get, these numbers just kind of seem a little unwieldy because probably you're not
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.240]   going to be spending as much as your wealth accumulates, especially if you've been frugal
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.120]   and a disciplined investor over 10, 20, 30, 40-year period of time.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.160]   So it gets a little bit scary sometimes to say, "Wow, that's a big number what you're
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.160]   used to.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.160]   It's much bigger than what you're used to."
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.560]   But if you start thinking in percentages such as you like 40% of your net worth in real
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:48.600]   estate, 30% in stocks and so forth, then it makes reinvesting or investing in general
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.600]   easier.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.760]   All right, the fifth lesson, you will likely lose money.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.160]   So don't forget to diversify.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:01.040]   It is a fact that if you invest in risk assets, you will lose money.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:07.440]   Now, although I received this nice $122,423 windfall in July, one of the investments in
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.160]   the fund was a complete wipeout, a donut, a zero.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.680]   The $50,000 position went to zero.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.920]   And the failed investment was called Student Housing at College Town in Toledo, Ohio.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.540]   It was an acquisition by the sponsor William Fidelity Investments of a 590-room student
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.760]   housing complex located in Toledo, Ohio.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:34.920]   The sponsor also projected a very attractive 18% internal rate of return over two years.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.920]   Now, if you click over to the post, you'll look at the image of the deal and you'll probably
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.280]   think, "Wow, that sounds great.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.800]   18.4%, two years, student housing, so cheap.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.480]   Sign me up."
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:54.400]   So I was pleased with this investment by the fund managers and it turned out to be a bagel.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.400]   And why is that?
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.720]   Well, the property was a failure because the sponsor had spent too much on the remodeling,
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.760]   refurbishing, and more importantly, there was not a large enough equity cushion in case
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.920]   things turned sour.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.640]   And then of course, COVID happened.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.920]   COVID was terrible for student housing in 2020 and in the first half of 2021 because
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.600]   all the students were sent home.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.320]   Nobody was going to be in a social raging party apartment complex during the first year,
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.080]   year and a half of COVID.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.520]   And why was it just a zero?
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.680]   Because obviously the property is worth something and you have to understand the capital stack
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.440]   when you're investing in private real estate deals.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.540]   And I'll include this in the show notes.
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.240]   But if you only have a, let's say, 10% equity cushion and you're the equity investor and
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:47.440]   the property is resold for 10% less than what it was projected to sell for or the acquisition
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.380]   price, you could get crushed.
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.320]   And obviously if it sells for 20% less, then you're definitely crushed.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.700]   You're definitely going to zero.
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:01.360]   So equity investing in private real estate is riskier, but the upside is also greater.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.080]   If you want to be a debt investor, it is less risky.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.760]   However, the returns are lower.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.900]   So there's no free lunch folks.
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:15.400]   So do your diligence, do diligence, diversify, understand that you will lose money.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:20.240]   Thankfully, the fund still has about 17 other investments.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.380]   Some are performing well, some are underperforming.
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.080]   But I've already received about 70% of my capital back.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:33.000]   So I'm bullish that the overall IRR of this fund will do pretty well over a five to 10
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   year period.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.320]   However, let me just warn everybody again, unexpected bad things happen all the time.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:45.380]   Do not get easily smitten by amazing marketing material.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.560]   Every deal always sounds and seems amazing.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.040]   If it doesn't, marketing is not doing their job.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.620]   And as we know, not all investments turn out well.
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.120]   So doing your due diligence is a must before making any investment.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.100]   Always view a real estate deal with extreme skepticism.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.920]   Any investment you make, anything you want to put your hard earned capital towards, view
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.920]   it with skepticism.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.120]   View anything with skepticism.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.480]   Obviously, have some balance and look at the other side as well and figure out what could
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.200]   go wrong.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.240]   But losing money is inevitable when it comes to investing in risk assets.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:27.240]   Therefore, you must invest in a risk appropriate manner and diversify.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.000]   So six, live where you want.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.900]   Invest where the returns are potentially the highest.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.040]   This is one of the best things about the internet and technology.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.280]   We can now live wherever we want.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.880]   Many of us can work from home and we can invest more strategically.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.640]   My ideal real estate lifestyle is living in Hawaii or San Francisco and investing in the
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.800]   heartland for greater passive income.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.440]   Your best real estate life might be living in Texas and investing in Los Angeles before
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:59.120]   foreigners begin buying up massive amounts of coastal city real estate once the borders
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.120]   reopen.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.820]   Take a look at what's going on in China.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:06.760]   They're locking down hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people in random cities
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.760]   because they're trying to go for a COVID zero policy.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.840]   If you are a multi-millionaire or a billionaire and you've been living through that for the
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.200]   past two and a half years, you're logically going to think, "How do I get some of my capital
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   out of China?
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.620]   How do I get myself out of China to live in a more free world like America or Canada or
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.120]   somewhere in Europe?"
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.440]   Because man, even if you are a billionaire and you've got to be locked down and face
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.000]   all these stringent protocols, that crimps your lifestyle tremendously.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.200]   So I do believe in this thesis, folks.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.920]   Foreign investors are making a comeback.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:45.760]   53 billion in investments over the past 12 months, that was a big uptick recently, this
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.760]   past 12 months.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.920]   And I think that's going to continue to 100 billion a year in 2023 and so forth.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.000]   So as the real estate market fades with a rise in interest rates and a slowdown in the
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.400]   economy over the next 12 months, you should strategically be thinking about trying to
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:04.480]   pick up deals for maybe 10% off January 2022 prices.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.960]   And the final takeaway from investing in private real estate and also any private investment
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.360]   is to forecast your real estate investment distributions.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.480]   If you know a large amount of investment distributions are coming one year, then you may want to
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.040]   work less or reduce your side hustles.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.040]   If you are a small business owner, you can pay yourself less and spend more capex that
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.040]   year.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:33.760]   So the idea is you want to smooth out your income so you pay less taxes.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:39.400]   Conversely, if you have a dearth of private investment distributions coming, you can earn
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.280]   more without paying as large of a tax bill.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.520]   You might want to job hop for that better job opportunity.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.120]   You might want to do more side hustles or work on your business.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.880]   You can pick up extra consulting jobs, no problem.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:57.240]   Or you can reduce capex if you're a small business owner to earn more business income.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.020]   Map out your potential distributions, your private investment distributions on a spreadsheet
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.220]   by year, then plan accordingly.
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:11.680]   For 2022, I had forecasted 112,800 in total real estate crowdfunding distributions.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.900]   And once the quarterly report comes out in another quarter, I'll do a postmortem analysis
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:23.920]   on exactly how much of the 122,423 is profits versus original invested capital.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:33.900]   I'm estimating about $62,423 of that 122,423 in distributions is taxable gains, but I won't
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.900]   know for sure.
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.540]   But I have a good idea.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:42.580]   This is what helps me manage my time and my efforts because I am technically a small business
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.580]   owner, right?
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.360]   Financial samurai is technically a business.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.100]   So I can decide what to do.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.280]   I can write more.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.700]   I can write less.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.920]   I can relax.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.960]   And this will help you plan out your time.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.420]   Most important asset you have is your time and your energy and your stress.
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:04.180]   I know a lot of us have spent a lot of time during the pandemic working hard, taking care
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.380]   of our families, solidifying our finances.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.940]   But it could be that, you know, things are slowing down now and it's time to take back
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.820]   our time and relax more.
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.300]   That's exactly what I want to do.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.920]   So those are my seven key takeaways from investing in private real estate over the past five
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.920]   years.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:27.060]   In Buy This, Not That, I go deep into talking about real estate, strategic investments,
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.780]   where to live, when to buy and so forth.
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.880]   So I hope you pick up a hard copy of the book.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.040]   And if you see a paperback version of the book, it's actually unauthorized.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.160]   It's a copy by someone else who's trying to pick off my work.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.160]   How crazy is that?
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.160]   But you know what?
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.160]   It's funny.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.520]   Every time I publish something new on financial samurai, at least three sites scrape 100%
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.900]   of my content.
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:53.960]   And then at least several more sites try to repurpose my content for their own.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.960]   And that's the funny thing.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.000]   It's just the way it is.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.920]   The world is so competitive and it's so hard to be an original thinker and to come up with
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.120]   new ideas.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:06.980]   So oftentimes, it's easier to just game the system and copy.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:11.720]   But if you copy, steal, cheat, you're not going to feel good inside.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:17.460]   So I hope everyone continues to think creatively, support the creators, especially if the content
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.320]   is free, and to encourage original thinking.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.560]   Thanks so much everyone for supporting Buy This, Not That.

[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.860]   a multi-decade trend, folks.
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.240]   And I plan to be there and ride that wave.
