[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   Let's talk about brown fat.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.320]   If you're willing, I'd love to drill into brown fat at a deep level.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.040]   Again, my understanding of this is far more elementary than yours, obviously.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.200]   You're the expert.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.160]   My understanding about brown fat is that it's located in specific areas of our body, maybe
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.920]   more widespread than when I learned in school.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.560]   I was taught it was just at the clavicles and the back of the neck and upper back, but
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.560]   who knows?
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.960]   I learned that there's more of it when we're children, maybe more distributed throughout
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.480]   our body, and that it's rich in mitochondria.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.760]   What is so special about the brown fat?
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.360]   If we could just go into the biology of brown fat a little bit, what does it look like?
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.920]   You've measured it in human subjects.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.880]   Where is it distributed really?
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.920]   Can it expand its distribution?
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.720]   Can we activate and expand the amount of brown fat as adults?
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.100]   For those of you that are cringing already thinking we're talking about getting fatter,
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.100]   it's quite the opposite.
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.740]   We're talking about not subcutaneous fat, but fat located around the organs.
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.380]   Please educate me.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.240]   Tell me where I'm wrong and expand my knowledge on brown fat.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.240]   Okay.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.400]   Yeah, you are not wrong, but it's true that there are more locations of the brown fat
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.680]   than we previously thought.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.960]   There's this very nice study from 2017 by Leitner et al., where they had made these
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:37.080]   PET-CT overlays of their subjects, but you can see where in the body do we have brown
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.380]   fat and where can we grow more brown fat, so to say.
[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.800]   So the brown fat is very plastic, so it means that it can grow and it can decrease, and
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:55.040]   this is proven in studies where we have seen people with a failed cryocytoma, it's like
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.240]   a very specific cancer type, where from the '70s where we can see that if they have this
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.760]   specific kind of cancer type, they have this tumor on the adrenal gland, so they have like
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.560]   a huge increase in noradrenaline.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.120]   And because of that, they have this continuous activation of the brown fat.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.600]   And they have grown a lot of brown fat in the whole body, abdomen, or where it's located
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.520]   in these six different places, but it is very much compared to normal people.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.760]   And what they then see, what we learned from this study, is that brown fat can apparently
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.440]   grow if you have an increase in noradrenaline in the body.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.880]   It's not like you want that, because when that happens, you have a high blood pressure.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.400]   You don't want it chronically, right?
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.040]   You just want it on a short amount of time, and then it can grow for a bit, but you don't
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.960]   want it chronically, of course not, because it activates also your sympathetic nervous
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   system.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.280]   So they have also showed they have high blood pressure.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.760]   They lost a lot of weight, of course, because this is activating your metabolism.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:12.800]   So they found, luckily, that when they removed this benign tumor, that the brown fat decreases
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.520]   again to normal size, and they gained weight again, and they had normal blood pressure.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.440]   So the story ends well, but it's kind of like proof of concept of the brown fat can actually
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.440]   grow.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.920]   So it's plastic in its way of like it can grow and it can decrease again.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.640]   So that's very good, good studies to see what the body is capable of.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.880]   But we don't, of course, want all that brown fat.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.000]   We just want it to be, we just want to keep it, actually, and keep it activated, because
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.080]   what we see in studies is also that after the age of 40, people, studies have shown
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.720]   that there is an association with having less brown fat, but increased obesity.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.040]   So of course, we don't know yet whether brown fat decreases with age, and therefore we get
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.120]   obese or we get obese, and therefore we have less brown fat.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:11.880]   But as brown fat is an insulin sensitive organ in our body, and we get obese, just like the
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.920]   muscles get less sensitive, insulin sensitive, the brown fat does as well, and therefore
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.360]   it maybe decreases.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.360]   It could be a theory that I think could be one of the reasons why we don't see that much
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.120]   brown fat in elderly people.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.840]   Some have a lot, especially people working outside, there are studies showing this.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.680]   People who do physical work outside, farmers, and interesting.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.840]   They expose themselves to it, so they'll just keep it in that way.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.280]   And I suppose we should clarify for people in case they don't know that insulin sensitivity
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.480]   is a very good thing.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.480]   You want that.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.440]   You want your cells to be sensitive to insulin.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.040]   Insulin insensitivity is type two diabetes, and is associated with obesity.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.920]   So just a point of clarification there.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.920]   It's interesting to me.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.120]   I usually work out at home, but I go to a gym once or twice a week if I can, because
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.640]   it's good if I see the outside world.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.960]   And there are a few individuals at the gym who, they're not particularly large or muscular,
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:29.040]   but they are incredibly lean, and their posture is great, presumably from the musculoskeletal
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.040]   work, and they're in their 70s and 80s.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.600]   I mean, it's remarkable, right?
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.160]   And I know all the telltale signs of hormone augmentation.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.320]   I'm very good at spotting that.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   There are a few telltale signs.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:48.240]   I've talked about this on other podcasts, and that's not why they're fit.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.280]   They're clearly of that look, and you see this outside the gym too, of course, for people
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.360]   that look like they've done a lot of physical labor their whole life.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.960]   They're just moving a lot.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:05.160]   They have strong hands and features, and they're not necessarily excessively lean, but you
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.900]   can tell that they've been using their musculoskeletal system.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.520]   And I like to talk to these people and ask them, not what are you doing now for your
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.600]   workout, but what did you grow up doing?
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.680]   And I would say, and obviously I haven't run statistics on this, but more than 75% of them
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.440]   respond that they grew up on a farm or that they did some sort of manual labor or were
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.320]   a postman or a postwoman or doing something where they moved a lot for their early years
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.520]   and throughout middle age.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.360]   And most of them are now in retirement, but some of them are still working and they all
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.320]   still moving a lot.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.480]   So the relationship between shiver and brown fat makes sense to me, but is it the case
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.760]   that as we're just moving around, I've heard of NEAT, non-exercise induced thermogenesis.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.680]   So if we're just moving around, that we are activating brown fat, or does there need to
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.840]   be this stressor?
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.840]   Does there need to be shiver and a cold stimulus or a heat stimulus to activate the brown fat?
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:10.400]   In other words, is just staying active enough, or do we need to do some sort of temperature
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.480]   shock type thing like deliberate cold exposure?
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:19.680]   Yeah, I think that is a really good question, because how, also why do we have this tissue?
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.960]   Then if it has to be extreme, then you can question what do we need this tissue for?
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.840]   But it seems that you can activate the brown fat with just a little bit of exposure to
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.840]   cold.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.760]   So cold is the most potent stressor activator of our brown fat because it's our temperature
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.200]   regulating organ in our body, so first responder to that.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.760]   So the muscles will be a little bit too late, and therefore we have maybe these two kind
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.760]   of tissues.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.880]   So actually just exposing yourself or a hand actually just to cold water.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:55.480]   So studies have shown that if you just put your hand in cold water, not that you're going
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:01.440]   to do that all day or every day or anything, it's not something you have to do, but it
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.560]   just shows that you can activate your brown fat just by getting a temperature change on
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.560]   your skin.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.240]   So you can go outside in a t-shirt, that's why also we were just talking about, well,
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:17.040]   people who works outside or move a lot or get in and out of it, like changing the temperature
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.960]   of their body all the time, they will have more brown fat and activating that is going
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.080]   to keep your metabolism higher and your insulin sensitivity, studies have also shown this.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.440]   So the brown fat can be activated as soon as you just change your temperature in the
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.440]   skin.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.320]   So going outside in a t-shirt, wearing cooling vests, also studies have shown this for 10
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.040]   minutes, it's going to also grow your brown fat.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.340]   So you can get more brown fat if you expose yourself to the cold.
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.120]   You don't have to start in a cold shower.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.900]   You don't have to start in a cold plunge if you're not really ready for that yet.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:58.400]   But just exposing yourself to the cold wind has also shown to activate your brown fat.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:04.440]   Or if you don't want to be like in this awake state, then you can also just sleep in the
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.800]   cold and you won't notice it that much, maybe, but studies have shown that if you sleep in
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:15.560]   19 degrees Celsius, then you will activate your brown fat and you will grow your brown
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.560]   fat.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.560]   So you have more of it.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:27.000]   So this very nice studies from Hanson et al. from 2017 showed that a group of subjects
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.560]   who slept in a room at 24 degrees, and then they made this PET CT scanning to see how
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.640]   much brown fat do they have from the beginning, so what we call baseline.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.360]   Then they measured again after a month of sleeping in 19 degrees and they saw, I think
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.440]   it's remarkable, just one month at 19 degrees sleeping there.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.760]   They had a duvet on and they were still had clothes on when they're sleeping.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.680]   So they're under a cover, under a duvet.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.120]   Under a duvet, yeah.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.700]   The subjects were sleeping at 19 degrees for one month, had increased insulin sensitivity.
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.740]   The next month they slept at 24 degrees, they measured this again and they had decreased
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.040]   actually a little bit, and then they slept at 27 degrees.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:14.240]   So quite warm room actually for the fourth month and they saw even less activation of
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.640]   the brown fat and also insulin sensitivity.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.720]   So it seems that you can expose yourself and pretty rapidly the brown fat will respond
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.740]   to this because it's so sensitive to noradrenaline, right?
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.920]   So if you keep exposing yourself to a little bit of cold, you also get a little bit adapted
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.640]   to it, but that's because the brown fat has grown these more mitochondria in the cells.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.360]   So these small energy fabrics, that's going to activate the cells and that's going to
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:48.260]   take up glucose and fat from the fatty acids from the bloodstream to keep the thermogenesis
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.320]   up.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.020]   And that's going to clear up some sugar and it's going to clear up in the bloodstream
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.400]   and some fat as well.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:02.120]   So the brown fat can in that way decrease our unhealthy fat, which is the white fat.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:07.960]   And the white fat is what we don't want too much of, but we still need some, of course,
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.320]   and it's our energy storage.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.000]   So it's very important that it's there.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.960]   We just don't need a lot of it.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:18.040]   So on our thighs and also around our inner organs, that's where it's located.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.800]   So if we can have activation of the brown fat just by going out in the cold and just
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.080]   by sleeping in a cold room, or if you have courage for it, you can go out and expose
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.600]   yourself in a cold plunge.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.960]   Cold showers is also going to do the trick.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.060]   So you can do different variations of this.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.560]   Just exposing yourself to various temperatures is going to activate the brown fat because
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:45.360]   it was involved to keep us in a perfect homeostatic balance regarding temperature.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:54.760]   So to keep us alive.
