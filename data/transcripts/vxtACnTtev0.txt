[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.900]   - Good Monday morning to everyone out there listening.
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.720]   Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.560]   We're gonna start this week with a question
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.040]   from an anonymous listener who writes in to ask this.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.800]   Hello, Pastor John, and thank you for APJ.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.840]   My question is this.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.520]   Can you tell me if Paul says in Colossians 2.12
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.520]   that faith causes regeneration,
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.800]   or is it the other way around?
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.800]   Does regeneration, the new birth, cause faith?
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.080]   I can't seem to make sense of this text,
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.960]   but it seems to answer the question.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.400]   I'd love your help.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.560]   Thank you.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.960]   - Well, Colossians 2.12 is a very precious verse
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.000]   for me personally,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.360]   not because it describes how I was raised
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.480]   from spiritual death to life in Christ,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.480]   but because it became a crucial text for me
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.640]   at a moment in my life in Germany,
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.640]   50 years ago this year,
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.280]   in a time of controversy over baptism,
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.160]   this verse, Colossians 2.12,
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.120]   shed light for me on the question,
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.360]   would I be a Baptist and continue to believe
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.920]   that only believers should be baptized,
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.920]   or would I shift and embrace infant baptism?
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.720]   Colossians 2.11 and 12 say,
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.960]   "In Christ, you were circumcised
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.920]   with a circumcision made without hands,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.200]   by putting off the body of flesh
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.320]   by the circumcision of Christ,
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.040]   having been buried with him in baptism,
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.920]   in which you were raised with him through faith."
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.800]   So underline that phrase, through faith.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.880]   In baptism, you were raised with him through faith
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.680]   in the powerful working of God
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.120]   who raised him from the dead.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.080]   So baptism represents death with Christ in burial
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.760]   and new life in Christ through resurrection
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.400]   as we come up out of the water.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.200]   And verse 12, it says,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.240]   "This resurrection with Christ in baptism
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.920]   happens through faith."
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.160]   And that little phrase, through faith,
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.840]   is one of the decisive reasons
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.720]   why I remained a Baptist,
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.440]   though I was the only Baptist in the class
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.000]   among Lutherans in Germany,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.320]   and I've remained so all my years,
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.080]   and why I do not think the New Testament
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.200]   teaches the baptism of infants
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.760]   who do not yet exercise faith.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.160]   But the person asking this question,
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.120]   we're not sure who it is,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.240]   but I'm glad they asked it.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.640]   The person asking this question
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.560]   is whether Colossians 2:12 teaches
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.080]   that this faith causes regeneration,
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.200]   that is, causes the new birth.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.480]   And the answer to that is, no, it doesn't teach that,
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.320]   and it doesn't teach the opposite,
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.960]   namely that the new birth causes faith.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.000]   That question is simply not addressed in this verse,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.240]   not as far as I can see, anyway.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.640]   You have been buried with Christ in baptism
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.640]   in which you were also raised with him through faith
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.400]   in the powerful working of God.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.280]   It's not addressed.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.280]   It's like saying, "I was buried after a cave-in in the mine,
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.920]   and I got out through a tunnel."
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.960]   But that statement, "through a tunnel,"
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.360]   doesn't tell you who built the tunnel, right?
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.360]   Did I dig it, or did someone dig it for me?
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.960]   None of that is addressed in this verse.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.760]   But I assume the person asking this question
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.480]   wants to know more than just,
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.400]   "Nope, the verse doesn't have anything to do with that.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.240]   See you later."
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.800]   That's probably not why this person wrote to us.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.280]   They're interested, I assume, in the doctrine,
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.400]   that is the teaching, the reality,
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.960]   not just the verse, namely,
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.960]   does faith bring about regeneration,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.080]   or does regeneration by the Holy Spirit bring about faith?
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.080]   Now, here's my answer.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.080]   I don't think there is a single verse,
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.320]   a single passage in the Bible
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.080]   that teaches that faith causes
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.080]   or brings about regeneration or the new birth.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.840]   But I think there are many texts
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.920]   that teach that the new birth precedes
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.000]   and brings about faith.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.360]   In other words, texts that teach that the new birth
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.360]   or regeneration is the gracious, free, sovereign work
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.360]   of God prior to our new life in Christ,
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.880]   which creates that life and brings about faith.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.000]   So let me give some passages that teach this
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.300]   and then say why I think it's so important.
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.960]   First John 5, one.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.960]   Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.520]   has been born of God.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.260]   Not everyone who believes will be born of God,
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.180]   but everyone who is now believing has, by virtue of that,
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.900]   you can see that, you see it in that effect,
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.100]   has already been born of God.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.920]   It's the new birth by God that brings about the believing.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.100]   Or John 1, 12.
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.900]   To all who received Christ, who believed in his name,
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.140]   he gave the authority to become the children of God.
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.120]   Now, then he explains what he just said,
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.100]   how that believing came about.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.480]   In the next verse, verse 13, quote,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.380]   who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:37.900]   nor of the will of man, but of God.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.300]   In other words, the new birth,
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.500]   he wants to underline several ways,
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.400]   did not come about from the powers of the flesh,
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.900]   nor from human willing.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.840]   It came about from God.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.600]   We didn't will ourselves alive.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.840]   God, not man, brings about the new birth,
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.180]   which provides the spiritual life, which believes.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.180]   Or Acts 13, 48, when the Gentiles heard Paul's gospel,
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.460]   they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.340]   And it says, as many as were appointed
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.900]   to eternal life, believed.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.620]   Not the other way around, not as many as believed
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.660]   were then appointed to eternal life,
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.960]   but as many as God had already appointed for eternal life,
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.460]   those are the ones who believed
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.460]   because God grants his elect the gift of faith.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.620]   Or Ephesians 2, 8, and 9,
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.820]   by grace you have been saved through faith.
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.800]   This is not your own doing.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.800]   It is the gift of God, not a result of works,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.460]   so that no one may boast.
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.080]   And if we had time, we could look at Philippians 1, 29.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.620]   I'm gonna list these so that people
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.840]   can just stop the recording right here
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.520]   and look them all up.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.680]   'Cause I said there were many, and I've only given what?
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.040]   One, two, three, four, five, four, five.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.000]   Philippians 1, 29, 2 Corinthians 4, 4-6,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   John 3, 7-8, John 6, 44, and 65, 2 Timothy 2, 25,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.040]   1 Corinthians 1, 23-24, and so on.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.040]   But I think I will let folks do their own work on that,
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.680]   track those down, decide if they agree,
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.680]   and close by giving some reasons, maybe three,
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.200]   why this is so important.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   'Cause some people may say, "Good grief, isn't it?
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.440]   "What difference does it make?
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.440]   "Believe and have life either way, first or second."
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.120]   Well, here's why it matters.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.120]   Number one, it makes us realistic and sober-minded
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.960]   about the power of sin if we believe
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.760]   that we must be raised from the dead before we can believe.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.060]   If we think that we can provide the decisive power
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.680]   in the moment of our conversion,
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.680]   if we think that we can provide the decisive power
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.120]   in the moment of our conversion
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.680]   to pass out of spiritual death that cannot please God
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.680]   into spiritual life that sees and treasures Christ in faith,
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:42.200]   we simply do not yet have a right view of the power
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.200]   and depth and horror of our own sinful depravity.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.320]   Paul says in Romans 8, 7,
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.100]   "The mind of the flesh is hostile to God.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.580]   "It does not submit to God's law.
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.660]   "Indeed, it cannot.
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.800]   "And those who are in the flesh cannot please God."
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.560]   In other words, the fallen condition of every human
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.560]   is the frightening, desperate, moral inability
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.400]   to change his own nature.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.000]   Left to ourselves, apart from sovereign grace
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.940]   decisively changing us so that we treasure
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.940]   the glory of Christ, we will be dead and blind forever.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:35.260]   We do no one any service by treating the condition
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:41.380]   of the fallen human heart in a way that's not true,
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.900]   by implying people can create their own faith
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.060]   when they are dead in their trespasses and sins.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.480]   Here's the second reason this really matters.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.440]   Unless we realize that God takes the initiative
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:02.520]   and provides the decisive power for us to wake
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.940]   from the dead and see Christ as true and glorious,
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.000]   we will never sing amazing grace
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   with the kind of understanding and affection
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.540]   that we ought to.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.960]   We'll never know the greatness and the sweetness
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.060]   of the grace of God unless we know that new birth
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.620]   was his totally sovereign undeserved gift
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.020]   when we were dead.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.580]   We just won't know what it means to be saved.
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.940]   And here's the third and the last one I'll mention.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.220]   Really it's two, but I'm combining them into one.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:43.680]   If you know that the new birth is the sovereign work of God,
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.680]   a gift of grace, you will have both hope
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.640]   in your praying and hope in your personal witnessing.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.920]   So prayer and evangelism, you will have hope
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.920]   to pray as you ought and witness to lost people
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.580]   as you ought.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.800]   You will realize that you cannot cause anyone
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.660]   to believe who is dead in their trespasses and sins
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.000]   and who's blind to the glory of Christ,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   but if you believe that God has ordained prayer
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.680]   and witnessing as the means of his own sovereign act
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.840]   in raising people from the dead,
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.620]   then you will be able to pray and to share the gospel
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.720]   with hope and with earnestness.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   So no, Colossians 2.12 does not teach this.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   Nor does it contradict this,
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.600]   but many other passages of scripture
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.160]   do teach the glorious truth that God is the one
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:02.040]   who regenerated dead sinners and who gave us faith.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.680]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.520]   And if you want more detail on Pastor John's debates
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.680]   with Lutherans over baptism 50 years ago,
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.080]   back in his studies in Germany,
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.640]   and particularly over this text of Colossians 2.12,
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.920]   we covered that period of his life in two past episodes.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.920]   Both can be found in our archive, ABJs 305 and 1372.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:27.200]   Go into those details, ABJs 305 and 1372.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.040]   Check them out.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.180]   And thanks for joining us today.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.640]   You can ask a question of your own,
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.840]   search our growing archive, or subscribe to the podcast,

[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:43.200]   Well, if you are God's blood-bought child,
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.600]   God makes much of you.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.920]   He does, he really does make much of you.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.840]   In fact, he makes more of you and more of me
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.080]   than we could ever dare imagine that he would.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.120]   How so?
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.820]   Pastor John is going to list the ways he does it.
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:58.920]   You won't wanna miss this one
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.960]   coming up next time on Wednesday.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.320]   and we will see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.160]   See you then.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:20.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
