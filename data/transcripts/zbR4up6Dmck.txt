[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140]   All right, we're gonna start our first question block
[00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.400]   with something we've been excited about for a while now,
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.780]   a live caller, so I can actually talk to someone
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.920]   back and forth.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.020]   We have video on the live caller too,
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.900]   so if you're a YouTube listener,
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.420]   youtube.com/counterpartmedia,
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.080]   you can actually see both of us on the screen.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.140]   Our first live caller is Spiros,
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.700]   who has questions about lifestyle-centric career planning
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.420]   and concerns about falling into the second control trap
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.900]   with his current career that may be going too well,
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.260]   and because of that, it is steering him,
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.140]   the pressures of that are perhaps steering him away
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.380]   from a deeper life.
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.720]   All right, so let's go to our phone line
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.460]   and talk with Spiros.
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.440]   All right, we have our next caller here.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.820]   Spiros, thank you for calling into
[00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.460]   the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.460]   Now, from what I understand, you actually have a case study
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.740]   you wanna share with us of some of the principles
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.540]   I talk about actually put into action.
[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.300]   - Yep, exactly, yeah.
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.700]   So what I would like to do is I would like to talk about
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.500]   how I've been applying So Good They Can't Ignore You
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.900]   since I read it like a long time ago, actually.
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140]   But then I feel like I kind of messed up
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.340]   somewhere along the way, so after I kind of summarize,
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.060]   I would like us to go into kind of like,
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.020]   where did I go wrong and where do I go from here?
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.620]   - Sounds good.
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.580]   - All right, so I moved to the US from Greece in 2012,
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.140]   like literally 10 years ago to do a PhD in robotics.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.660]   And I read your book a couple of years later, so in 2014.
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.460]   And I was like, whoa, okay, I see what I'm supposed to do.
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.580]   So I started applying it first to research,
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.620]   but then I got the opportunity to participate
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.380]   in the 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge.
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.020]   So then I started applying the principles
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.660]   to robotics software as opposed to just robotics research.
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.740]   That went pretty well.
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.620]   I got really into kind of like
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.820]   the more the software side of robotics.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.740]   I decided to take a little bit of absence
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.420]   to join a robotic startup,
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.460]   ended up dropping out of the PhD program with a master's,
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.780]   did really well in that startup.
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.340]   I was the first software engineer.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.060]   I hired a team eventually,
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.820]   followed the startup to Austin, Texas in 2016,
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.740]   then moved to San Francisco in 2017
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.460]   to work for another robotic startup.
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.420]   Again, did really well, got promoted,
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.100]   got to travel to Hong Kong and China
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.980]   for manufacturing purposes.
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.580]   And now since 2018, I've been working for one of the top
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.660]   three, perhaps the top self-driving car company
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.740]   here in San Francisco.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.980]   Again, I've been doing really well.
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.780]   I've gotten very high performance reviews.
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.620]   I've gotten promoted.
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.380]   I'm on track to get promoted again.
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.820]   I'm considered a very reliable, high performer,
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.460]   all of the good stuff you would expect from somebody
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.180]   following these principles.
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.740]   I have tons of options.
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.620]   I don't mean to like sound,
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.460]   I don't mean to brag,
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.740]   but like I get so much recruiter email these days
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.060]   that it's almost like spam.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.380]   So I do have options.
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.340]   Now, the reason,
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.300]   now this is where this is turning from a case study
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.140]   more to a question.
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.380]   I feel like to put it in terms of your book,
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.580]   I think I fell for the second control trap.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.780]   I think I got too excited about the performance
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.820]   and the promotions and the compensation
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.820]   and the recognition that I've kind of become too busy,
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.060]   I have too many responsibilities, I'm too busy.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.500]   My compensation is too good to ignore, if you will.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.620]   So that's kind of where I would like to focus
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.740]   the question part.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.580]   - Excellent, excellent.
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.420]   Well, let me first,
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.780]   I'm gonna back you up to the beginning of your case study
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.100]   just for the edification of our audience.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.620]   I wanna go back to you as a PhD student,
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.980]   you read so good, they can't ignore you.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.740]   Now you glossed over a little bit,
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.460]   oh, I put those principles into play
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.940]   and started becoming very successful in my studies.
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.140]   Let's go back and try to make that concrete.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.140]   So like, can you identify what did you start doing
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.620]   that let's say other students in your cohort
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.740]   who weren't as successful
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.340]   or you, the password yourself weren't doing?
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.460]   Let's try to do some differential analysis here.
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.140]   'Cause I'm curious in this beginning point first
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.860]   and then we'll get to you now.
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.300]   - Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.180]   So because of your own case study in the book,
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.500]   you were also a PhD student
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.140]   and eventually a postdoc, et cetera.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.660]   I was like, oh, I'm just gonna do exactly
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.980]   what Kyle talks about here.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.300]   Kyle talks about getting a very fundamental research paper
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.740]   and kind of like going deep into the research paper,
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.060]   trying to understand the proofs,
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.740]   trying to understand the results.
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.660]   So that's something that I did,
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.060]   I scheduled some time every week
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.540]   to go through either fundamental papers in my field.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.500]   So I was in formal methods in robotics,
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.980]   which is like formal verification, formal synthesis.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.820]   Anyway.
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.940]   - Yeah.
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.220]   Which by the way, I'm happy to geek out with you about that.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.980]   We can talk about your improvers
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.540]   and we would lose all of our audience.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.380]   But just let you know,
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.500]   I'm restraining myself right now.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.740]   - I'm tiptoeing around it on purpose.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.660]   'Cause this can be a rabbit hole, yeah.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.740]   So that's one thing that I remember very distinctly doing.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.220]   Then once I got the opportunity though,
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.300]   to participate in the DARPA Robotics Challenge,
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.220]   I was like, okay, I can apply this here as well.
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.940]   So then it shifted from like reading research papers
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.420]   as my deliberate practice, let's say,
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.740]   to learning C++, learning Python,
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.460]   which are like some fundamental languages
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.340]   for this kind of thing.
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.580]   And then something called the robot operating system,
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.060]   which is like a middleware for robotics applications.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.020]   So I knew that these things existed
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.860]   and I knew some programming of course already,
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.180]   but I was like, okay,
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.540]   these are the three fundamental things I need to know
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.260]   if I wanna write robotics software
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.420]   and like get the robot to actually do something.
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.660]   By the way, we got to work,
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.780]   like my team for the DARPA Robotics Challenge
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.220]   got to work with those like Atlas humanoid robots
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.860]   from Boston Dynamics.
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.380]   So yeah, pretty crazy platform to be working on.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.620]   - Also terrifying, but yeah, go on.
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.460]   - Yeah.
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.860]   And so that's another way I applied that.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.500]   So like I was, for example,
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.180]   I remember very distinctly scheduling blocks
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.420]   at the very beginning of my day,
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.940]   like before I even went into the grad student cubicles
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.740]   or whatever, like I would, let's say,
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.500]   go to a coffee shop or something like that.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.180]   And I would spend like, let's say two hours
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.660]   just going through tutorials, writing code,
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.260]   just deliberate practice.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.380]   - Okay, so just to clarify for the audience,
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.940]   the first thing you did was,
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.700]   it's hard to understand these fundamental papers.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.820]   Having that knowledge will be useful.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.460]   Quick follow-up here, because I get this question a lot.
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.300]   How did you actually structure the reading of hard papers
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.020]   without a formal forcing function?
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.380]   Like I need this for a project I'm working on.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.540]   You just had a system, a quota?
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.380]   How did you do that?
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.300]   - So yeah, so the way I motivated myself was that,
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.420]   hey, I'm seeing that I'm having a hard time
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.700]   with like the very formal aspect of writing.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.860]   So I was able to write research papers,
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.420]   but they were kind of like,
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.700]   they weren't going very deep on the math,
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.180]   on the proof side of things.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.060]   So I was like, okay, I'm gonna motivate myself
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.380]   by saying that by understanding the fundamental papers
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.500]   and how these proofs work,
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.700]   I will be able to do that myself eventually.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.820]   Then in terms of like how I structured that,
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.780]   I think it was something like,
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.500]   kick off a note in Evernote,
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.340]   pick one of these papers
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.460]   and then schedule time within the week.
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.780]   You know, as a grad student,
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.900]   I kind of like reminisce about the flexibility
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.620]   I had in my schedule as a grad student.
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.300]   - I reminisce about that.
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.740]   Yeah, once a month, at least once a month,
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.860]   I have a moment where I just insanely nostalgic for that.
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:23.860]   But anyways, go on.
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.700]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.660]   And so I was, if I recall correctly,
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.340]   this was like eight years ago at this point,
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.980]   I was scheduling time like on a weekly basis
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.340]   to make sure I get in at least a couple of hours.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.060]   So it's kind of like go over the paper.
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.100]   And then the other thing I was doing,
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.540]   which I think you also mentioned in the book is,
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.900]   when I was reading like papers around what I was writing,
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.860]   around like papers I wanted to reference
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.220]   and I wanted to cite in my own paper,
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.340]   I wouldn't just like skim through them or read them
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.900]   and then forget about them on a pile.
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.420]   I would actually take notes.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.420]   Like I would take digital,
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.420]   I would take notes on the paper and digital notes
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.540]   and I would kind of sketch out
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.860]   what this paper is trying to do
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.380]   and how it proves the results.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.700]   - Yeah, right.
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.980]   Well, okay, so just to summarize that
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.700]   before we jump now to the current moment,
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.300]   just to summarize that for the listener,
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.380]   what Spiros is doing here,
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.300]   which is straight out of "So Good They Can't Ignore You"
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.020]   is identifying the thing that is actually valuable
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.180]   in the field where you are,
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.220]   not what you want that answer to be,
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.580]   not what matches how you want your day to go,
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.980]   but what is actually valuable.
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.500]   So first off for him,
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.100]   that was understanding how to do
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.340]   this more fundamental theoretical work.
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.860]   And then later on, okay,
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.980]   understanding how to use
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.820]   all the different programming language tools
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.460]   that are relevant to the DARPA Robotics Challenge
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.340]   so I can be as useful as possible.
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.660]   And in both cases, what you did, which I think is right,
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.420]   is said, okay, that's the reality of what matters.
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.940]   What do I actually have to do to learn that?
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.780]   Oh, it's hard.
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.100]   I have to read these hard papers
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.900]   and I'm in the same place.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.780]   Theoretical computer science is the same
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.860]   as early in your grad student career.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.740]   Understanding papers is how you advance.
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.100]   Understanding papers is incredibly hard.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.980]   And those two things are true at the same time.
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.820]   And it was a big differentiating factor
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.780]   when I was coming up,
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.420]   those who would wrangle papers
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.060]   and those who would just look for what's easy.
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.820]   So I think that's a great example
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.140]   of the principles in action.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.300]   And it worked, okay.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.220]   So it worked too well.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.660]   So now we jump ahead.
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.700]   You're suffering from the second control trap.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.260]   So for people who haven't read that book,
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.420]   the first control trap is trying to get
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.780]   a lot of autonomy in your career
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.620]   before you built up the skills to actually justify it.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.980]   That's where you are 23 and you quit
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.180]   to start your nonprofit that's gonna change the world,
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.900]   but you don't know what you're doing.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.740]   The second control trap is when you get enough leverage
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.100]   and skills and power in the marketplace
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.660]   to actually have control of your career
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.940]   is exactly when all of the pressure in the marketplace
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.340]   is gonna be to stay, to move up to the next level,
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.460]   to take the higher salary.
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.780]   So it's when you're most able to be autonomous
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:53.740]   is when it's hardest.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.940]   And that's what you're hitting now.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.180]   So why don't you explain to us a little bit more,
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.060]   what is your job like now?
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.020]   What is your day-to-day like now?
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.100]   Is it managerial?
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:02.940]   Is it technical?
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.660]   Let's get a sense of where you are.
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.540]   - Yeah, so my title is Staff Software Engineer.
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.420]   So it sounds like I'm a software engineer,
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.460]   like I'm writing code every day,
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.060]   but I'm not actually writing code every day
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.580]   because at a certain level in the individual contributor,
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.020]   like a real ladder, as we call it,
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.260]   you kind of like fork into different archetypes.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.660]   So there is the software engineer archetype,
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.580]   and this is the person that like writes really good code.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.340]   There is the domain expert archetype.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.540]   This is the person who has like three PhDs
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.380]   in convex optimization or machine learning or whatever.
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.860]   So domain expert.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.860]   And then there is the archetype
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.100]   that I think I better fit into,
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.740]   which is kind of like high level tech lead,
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.220]   is what we call it.
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.620]   And so this is the person who is able to kind of
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.340]   understand how the system works end to end
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.420]   and kind of coordinate this team with this other team
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.740]   and this other person over here
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.300]   and get this other subsystem to do the right thing.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.220]   And then you get the entire project
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.140]   or the entire effort to do the right thing
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.620]   just by understanding the system end to end
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.460]   and leading the integration effort.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.260]   So to put it more concretely,
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.980]   I do everything from analyzing kind of like metrics
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.300]   to see kind of like where we have gaps,
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.780]   writing project proposals, writing design documents.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.140]   And then once we kind of move into the execution
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.020]   part of the project,
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.860]   I'm usually maybe I'm running some meetings or not,
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.820]   depending on whether we have
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.860]   a program manager support or not.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.340]   I'm coordinating all of these different individuals,
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.980]   software engineers, systems engineers, test engineers,
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.980]   sometimes operations teams that are like
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.820]   handling the self-driving cars on the road.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.980]   - So what's a day look like?
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.900]   Is it how much of it is Slack and email?
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.020]   How much of it is-
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.020]   - That's exactly what I do.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.020]   You hit the nail on the head.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.020]   It's very much hyperactive, hive mind mode all the way.
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.580]   I have to fight really hard just to block out
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.980]   like two hours at the beginning of my day.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.140]   And maybe if I'm lucky, I will actually get to actually
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.700]   do the work in those two hours.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.540]   Like today I'm on call, for example.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.980]   So like for all I know, once my on-call shift starts,
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.100]   I will be completely derailed by like an issue coming in
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.140]   on pager duty.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.260]   There is a lot of activity on Slack.
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.340]   I've done all sorts of really tips and tricks,
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.340]   applying some of the stuff from your books
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.860]   and your podcast to minimize that.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.620]   I only check email like, I try to check only once a day.
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.740]   I once experimented with going a week
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.740]   without checking work email and nothing terribly happened.
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.900]   So I'm very much inclined to keep doing that again, yeah.
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.300]   But like email is okay.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.020]   Slack is where most of the hyperactive,
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.180]   hyperactive mind is kind of like operating.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.620]   There are lots of meetings.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.860]   It got much worse, you know, during the lockdown.
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.980]   So I'm sure others are saying the same.
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.700]   Like sometimes I feel like,
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.780]   when am I supposed to like use the restroom
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:55.820]   and like make coffee?
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.820]   Like there is no time in between these meetings.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.660]   - Yeah, which is a first.
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.540]   - So there is a lot of that.
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:00.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.340]   There is a lot of that.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.780]   One of the things I talk to with my manager the most often
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.860]   is like, hey, we need to figure out a way for me.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.140]   I need to carve out time to do proactive work
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.220]   as opposed to waiting for a problem to arise
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.060]   and then doing reactive work and then fixing the problem.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.580]   Like the reactive work,
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.700]   part of the problem is that reactive work
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.780]   is actually gets recognized a lot.
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.620]   So there is like,
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.060]   it's really hard to motivate proactive work
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.860]   when there is tons of reactive work to do
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.700]   and it gets recognized too.
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.620]   So that's one challenge.
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.820]   - But why do you care about it being recognized?
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:38.460]   - Ooh, wow.
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.220]   I was not expecting that question.
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.300]   When I say recognized, I mean, okay,
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.660]   there is a recognition in terms of like,
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.860]   like performance reviews and stuff,
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.980]   but there is also the like doing what the company,
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.620]   the business thinks is most valuable.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.620]   Right now, this quarter, this month, this year, whatever.
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.380]   And it's often the case that what,
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.180]   the business priorities are to deal
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.100]   with the reactive problems.
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.620]   They are not to go and do proactive work.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.460]   - Yeah.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.900]   All right, well, I'm gonna give,
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.900]   I'm gonna give a two-part answer here
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.420]   and I'm gonna be terse
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.780]   because the second part of this answer
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.580]   is something that's probably gonna take you weeks
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.940]   of actual thinking to do right.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.340]   So you'll have to check back in.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.100]   I'm gonna give you a short-term,
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.180]   a short-term thing to try
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.020]   and a long-term thing to consider.
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.780]   The short-term thing to try is,
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.780]   I think this might be a good setup
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.580]   for a deep to shallow work ratio conversation
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.660]   with your manager.
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.620]   So I talked about this some in deep work,
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.980]   but then got a lot of feedback from people
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.580]   after that book came out
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.660]   about this particular strategy working well.
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.380]   So it's pretty well road tested.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.260]   And it's where you have a conversation
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.380]   like the type you're already having with your manager,
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.980]   but it's a little more quantitative, right?
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.780]   You say, okay, this is what deep work is.
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.820]   This is what like reactive work is.
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.580]   You're in a tech company in San Francisco.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.980]   So they probably know the term already.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.860]   And you say, what ratio of this sort of reactive,
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.300]   shallow to deep proactive do you think
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.220]   is optimal for my position?
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.340]   Like what ratio of those two is going to produce
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.420]   the most value net for the organization?
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.100]   So we got to get a number on it.
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.940]   And when you have to get quantitative about it,
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.820]   they're not gonna come back with the answer.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.420]   I want you to do a hundred percent reactive shallow, right?
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.380]   Because you have this other value,
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.420]   you have this training, you can produce new things.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.860]   So when you get a number that they agree to,
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.020]   this often leads to the dissolving of ossification
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:33.860]   in business culture.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.060]   So it lets loose a lot of innovations.
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.460]   They might say, okay, maybe it should be 50/50.
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.380]   So what we're gonna do is,
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.820]   mornings now are for you to do proactive work.
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.140]   No calls start till,
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.300]   you're not on call till the afternoon.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.420]   We tell the whole team, don't expect responses.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.300]   That's just an example.
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.500]   I don't know your exact situation.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.220]   It might be Tuesdays and Fridays.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.540]   You work from not at the office
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.300]   and maybe from somewhere else
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.700]   and you're just doing proactive.
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.380]   The quantitative nature of that really makes a difference.
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.660]   And the positive orientation makes a difference.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.460]   So it's you coming to your manager saying,
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.180]   how do I produce more for the company?
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.460]   Not you coming to the manager and saying,
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.820]   I'm fed up with you slacking me all the time.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.020]   You know, you're terrible.
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.900]   The latter conversation doesn't go well.
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.660]   The former conversation I have report
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.380]   after report of that working.
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:21.820]   This though is a short-term solution.
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.700]   Try that, see how it helps.
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.420]   And that might be it.
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.540]   My long-term solution,
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.180]   I'm gonna ask that you,
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.460]   you probably are at a good point.
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.300]   And let me actually ask you,
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.060]   how old are you if you don't mind sharing?
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.860]   - Yeah, I'm 34.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.780]   - Okay, so you're in this sort of heart
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.100]   of the millennial generation, approaching middle age.
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.220]   It's a perfect time to start thinking
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.260]   through these questions of, okay, let me step back.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.740]   How are things going in my life?
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.820]   What reconfigurations are looming on the horizon?
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:52.340]   It's a good time to go through a serious lifestyle centric
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.340]   career planning exercise where you really look out.
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.340]   I would look at 40 and 50 as age targets.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.340]   And like we talk about on the show,
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:04.460]   have this really clear vision of all aspects of your life
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.900]   in an ideal world at that point.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.780]   Not just work, but where you live,
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.380]   what you're doing with your time,
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.700]   who you're around, see it, smell it,
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.380]   taste it, we like to say.
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:17.100]   Get that vision for 40, get that vision for 50.
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.020]   And then look backwards and say, how do I get there?
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.460]   And in answering that question,
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.900]   you may end up saying, okay,
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.660]   my current career trajectory, that's fine.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.300]   I just have to do this deep to shallow work ratio,
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.140]   maybe do a lateral move at some point into more,
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.140]   you could maybe figure it out.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.340]   Or you might end up with an answer.
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.700]   You say, I have a lot of skills.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.580]   I am an ML robotics expert engineer.
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.540]   Okay, why don't I take that out for a spin?
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.860]   And I can actually maybe do something drastically different.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.860]   I'm on contract.
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.220]   I work six months out of the year.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.180]   I live on Vancouver Island.
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.700]   I mean, you have a lot of flexibility.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.980]   So short term, I would do that ratio conversation.
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:55.980]   Long term, I would say,
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.980]   let's go through that exercise in detail.
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.380]   And just see where it leads you.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.300]   And don't be afraid if it leads you to,
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.300]   I'm more or less close, I see to make some tweaks,
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.620]   or if it leads you to,
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.060]   I'm about to buy a ranch outside of Austin.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.900]   It could lead you in a lot of different directions
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.220]   to be open to all of that.
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.140]   How does those as a one-two punch,
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.460]   how does that sound as a potential way forward?
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.100]   - I'm glad the conversation went there
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.540]   'cause I kind of anticipated this
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.060]   and I've already done the first draft
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.180]   of what you just described.
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.300]   - All right, tell us.
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.420]   - It could come up.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.340]   - Should I actually go into it?
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.100]   - Yeah, okay, give us the brief summary
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.380]   of the ideal lifestyle picture you're playing with.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.380]   - So the brief summary is that,
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.900]   so I'm originally from Greece, right?
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.380]   So I wanna get to a point where
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.540]   I can spend more or less every summer in Greece.
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.740]   Working, not working, doesn't really matter.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.860]   Spend about six months out of the year in the US
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.660]   and then spend another quarter
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.660]   just working from somewhere else.
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.500]   Other things I wanna be doing,
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.900]   I wanna be able to be near the water.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.580]   I love swimming, I love water sports and whatnot,
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.780]   so I wanna be able to do that.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.180]   I want to start writing.
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.300]   I wrote a few blog posts and articles back in grad school
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.380]   and I really enjoyed that,
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.980]   but I gave that up later on to focus on my career.
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.020]   So I wanna get back into writing,
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.820]   maybe eventually actually write a book,
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:19.860]   we'll see about that.
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.340]   I want to, so I'm currently single,
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.260]   so eventually I wanna be able to meet somebody.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.140]   Now I feel like I'm so busy or so exhausted
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.500]   that I don't even make enough time in my schedule
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.220]   for dating, so I definitely wanna,
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.180]   the connection back with the suffering,
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.300]   essentially, to put it in deep life terms.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.300]   Other things in there, funny you mentioned Austin.
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.100]   It's actually Austin is on that roadmap
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.860]   because I figured that if I were to move to Austin,
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:50.340]   which is central time, but I work Pacific time hours,
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.820]   then I get two extra hours in the morning
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.620]   when I still have energy and willpower
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.780]   to do things like deep work, to do things like writing
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.580]   before I engage with the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.700]   So Austin is actually on the trajectory, potentially.
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.540]   - Well, okay.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.060]   I mean, it sounds like to me,
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.780]   you're heading down the path
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.740]   towards changing your career situation.
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:18.820]   If that lifestyle sounds like either a greatly reconfigured
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.620]   job at your current employer
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.540]   or a different setup altogether
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.700]   that's maybe more freelancer contractor based,
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.060]   is that a scary thought for you
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.900]   or is that where you've led yourself already?
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.820]   - Exactly, you're spot on again.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.540]   What is scary is I don't wanna,
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.500]   in my attempt to escape the second control trap,
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.020]   I don't want to accidentally veer all the way
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.220]   to the first control trap 'cause it'd be easy to say,
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.820]   screw all this, I have enough money in the bank
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.540]   to last me X many years, I'm just gonna quit.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.380]   I'm just gonna say, screw Silicon Valley,
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:53.100]   I'm gonna go to Mexico and work on my book or whatever.
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.580]   But then I would be probably falling
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.100]   for the first control trap if I go so extreme.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.460]   So the scary challenge is bridging the gap
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.860]   between where I am right now
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.220]   and kind of this vision for when I'm 40 or when I'm 50.
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.660]   - Yeah, well, okay, this is great.
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.980]   So in the first answer, I gotta give some generic advice
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.340]   about deep to shallow ratios as a first step
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.700]   and lifestyle-centered career planning.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.140]   Now we get an example of lifestyle-centered career planning.
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.100]   So I can give you a piece of advanced advice
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.460]   that goes to lifestyle-centered career planning
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.580]   and implementation and you're spot on
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.500]   about you don't wanna fall back into the first control trap.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.980]   You're not gonna be happy if you say,
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.820]   I'm gonna go to rent a house in Cabo
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.900]   and just work on my book.
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:37.380]   That'll last a month before you start to get antsy.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.540]   So what I'm always looking for in this situation
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.380]   is concrete exemplars.
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.460]   I'll often talk about the rule of three.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:49.340]   So you wanna find a real person who has your background,
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.180]   who has a professional setup that resonates.
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.060]   Hey, that works.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.660]   Okay, here's how they did it.
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.540]   Oh, they're a contractor that works
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.540]   on this type of ML project or whatever.
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:01.980]   Like it's concrete.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.220]   This is someone and it's a job that they do.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.500]   It's a six month a year job.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.660]   It's a flexible enough job that they take summers off.
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.980]   They go up to New England in the summer.
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.500]   So real people doing with your skillset,
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.580]   what you wanna do.
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.340]   Rule of three is if you wanna be really secure,
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.500]   find three different people doing something like that.
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.800]   So now you know it's not a one-off,
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.580]   it's actually a viable path,
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.980]   but have a specific target
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.540]   that you're working backwards from.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.220]   This guy, her and him did this setup
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.460]   with my type of skillset.
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:31.900]   How do I move there?
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.980]   I mean, I will say I'm doing that
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.700]   in some of my own lifestyle centric
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.860]   midlife career planning I've been doing.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.060]   I don't share a lot of details
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.460]   about exactly what I'm thinking about
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.300]   because there's a lot of stakeholders involved,
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.340]   but this has been my approach
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.500]   is what I'm seeking is examples.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.860]   I am seeking people with similar backgrounds
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.860]   who have already figured out a configuration
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.060]   that seems to work.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.900]   That's how I think you can avoid the first career trap.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.060]   I think you're there right now, the seeking stage.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.580]   Go seek out these examples, meet the people.
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.220]   Also, by the way, say, can I call you?
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.780]   Can I take you out for coffee?
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.940]   If they're local, people are happy to share details
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.740]   of their experience and get concrete with them.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:10.820]   How did you make this change?
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.840]   What are the hard parts?
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.060]   What advice do you have?
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.460]   I don't know if you ever talked, you probably didn't,
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.900]   but in that top performer course I did with Scott Young,
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:20.980]   we talked a lot about this,
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.020]   this journalistic approach to career development
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:23.860]   where it's like--
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.060]   - I know of that course, but I haven't taken it.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.740]   - We have students actually go through this.
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.160]   It's like you're writing an article
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.740]   on how this specific type of job transition works.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.980]   You're out there doing research,
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.100]   gathering real information, always concrete,
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.260]   always like this is something
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.580]   that people are actually doing.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.100]   And I think you are ready to start looking
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:42.980]   for those exemplars,
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.660]   which is also an exciting part of the process
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.460]   because you get all the aspiration
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.260]   without actually having to yet do anything that's scary.
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.180]   So, good for you.
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.940]   I think you're in the fun part.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.100]   But I would, no reason why you can't start
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.700]   just trying to find people right now
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.080]   who come out of your background,
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.980]   who have a setup where they work eight months a year,
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.220]   they work six months a year, they're location independent.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.540]   I'm sure they're out there in your field.
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.220]   There may be an academic affiliation,
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.180]   there may be a nonprofit affiliation,
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.780]   maybe they're a fellow at the OpenAI, whatever.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.240]   And there's so many options out there for your field.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.800]   I think you're ready to start looking for concrete examples.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.320]   - This makes a lot of sense and really resonates.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.420]   Yeah, you've mentioned this before,
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.900]   but I never pieced it together.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.600]   You're right, yeah, that's what I need to do.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.440]   - Excellent.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.660]   Well, Spiros, keep me posted.
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.680]   I wanna know what you end up doing
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.760]   and maybe we'll follow up
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.740]   and we'll share that with the audience.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.140]   But in the meantime, thanks for the case study.
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:33.980]   Thanks for the questions
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.280]   and also an excuse for me
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.180]   to go through a lot of different advice.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.900]   So I find that useful as well.
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.740]   - Yeah.
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.560]   - All right, so good luck for you.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.400]   Thanks very much.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.240]   - Thank you, Kyle and Jesse.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.080]   Bye.
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.480]   (upbeat music)
