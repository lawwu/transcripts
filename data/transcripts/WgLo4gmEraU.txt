[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   The following is a conversation with Lee Smolin.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.520]   He's a theoretical physicist,
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.680]   co-inventor of loop quantum gravity,
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.840]   and a contributor of many interesting ideas
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.320]   to cosmology, quantum field theory,
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.920]   the foundations of quantum mechanics,
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.360]   theoretical biology, and the philosophy of science.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.160]   He's the author of several books,
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.000]   including one that critiques the state of physics
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.080]   and its string theory called "The Trouble with Physics,"
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.080]   and his latest book, "Einstein's Unfinished Revolution,
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.320]   "The Search for What Lies Beyond the Quantum."
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.960]   He's an outspoken personality in the public debates
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.680]   on the nature of our universe,
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.320]   among the top minds in the theoretical physics community.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.080]   This community has its respected academics,
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.520]   its naked emperors, its outcasts and its revolutionaries,
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.980]   its madmen and its dreamers.
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.640]   This is why it's an exciting world to explore
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.880]   through long-form conversation.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.880]   I recommend you listen back to the episodes
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.240]   of Leonard Susskind, Sean Carroll, Michio Kaku,
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.240]   Max Stegmark, Eric Weinstein, and Jim Gates.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.840]   You might be asking, "Why talk to physicists
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.200]   "if you're interested in AI?"
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.840]   To me, creating artificial intelligence systems
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.440]   requires more than Python and deep learning.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.400]   It requires that we return to exploring
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.400]   the fundamental nature of the universe and the human mind.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.240]   Theoretical physicists venture out into the dark,
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.600]   mysterious, psychologically challenging place
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.220]   to force principles more than almost any other discipline.
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.920]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.200]   If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.280]   get five stars on Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon,
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.320]   or simply connect with me on Twitter,
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.520]   @LexFriedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.360]   As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now,
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.680]   and never any ads in the middle
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.920]   that can break the flow of the conversation.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.240]   I hope that works for you
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.560]   and doesn't hurt the listening experience.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.520]   This show is presented by Cash App,
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.800]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.240]   When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.440]   Cash App lets you send money to friends,
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.880]   buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.800]   with as little as $1.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.160]   Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.400]   let me mention that cryptocurrency,
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.680]   in the context of the history of money, is fascinating.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.520]   I recommend "A Scent of Money"
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.480]   as a great book on this history.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.160]   Debits and credits on ledgers
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.320]   started around 30,000 years ago.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.000]   The US dollar, of course, created over 200 years ago.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.240]   And Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency,
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.880]   was released just over 10 years ago.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.200]   So given that history,
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.880]   cryptocurrency is still very much
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.920]   in its early days of development,
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.560]   but it still is aiming to,
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.040]   and just might, redefine the nature of money.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.400]   If you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.080]   and use the code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10,
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.920]   and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.720]   one of my favorite organizations
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.880]   that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.840]   for young people around the world.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.220]   And now, here's my conversation with Lee Smolin.
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.080]   What is real?
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.440]   Let's start with an easy question.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.160]   Put another way, how do we know what is real
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.680]   and what is merely a creation
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.200]   of our human perception and imagination?
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.640]   - We don't know.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.480]   We don't know.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.300]   This is science.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.940]   I presume we're talking about science.
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.280]   And we believe, or I believe,
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.520]   that there is a world that is independent of my existence
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.520]   and my experience about it and my knowledge of it.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.840]   And this I call the real world.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.120]   - So you said science, but even bigger than science.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.120]   - Sure, sure.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.380]   I need not have said this is science.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.340]   I just was warming up.
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.500]   - Warming up.
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.820]   Okay, now that we're warmed up,
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.060]   let's take a brief step outside of science.
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.420]   Is it completely a crazy idea to you
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.420]   that everything that exists
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.800]   is merely a creation of our mind?
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.800]   So there's a few, not many, this is outside of science now,
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.540]   people who believe perception
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.980]   is fundamentally what's in our human perception,
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.620]   the visual cortex and so on,
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.260]   the cognitive constructs that's being formed there,
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.060]   is the reality.
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.700]   And then anything outside
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.500]   is something that we can never really grasp.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.100]   Is that a crazy idea to you?
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.760]   - There's a version of that that is not crazy at all.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.340]   What we experience is constructed by our brains
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.220]   and by our brains in an active mode.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.920]   So we don't see the raw world.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.820]   We see a very processed world.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.500]   We feel something that's very processed through our brains
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.140]   and our brains are incredible.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:55.140]   But I still believe that behind that experience,
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.420]   that mirror or veil or whatever you wanna call it,
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.540]   there is a real world and I'm curious about it.
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.720]   - Can we truly, how do we get a sense of that real world?
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.620]   Is it through the tools of physics
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.420]   from theory to the experiments?
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.340]   Or can we actually grasp it in some intuitive way
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.340]   that's more connected to our ape ancestors?
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.180]   Or is it still fundamentally the tools of math and physics
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.020]   that really allow us to grasp it?
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.060]   - Well, let's talk about what tools they are.
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.060]   What you say are the tools of math and physics.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.460]   I mean, I think we're in the same position
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.900]   as our ancestors in the caves
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.180]   or before the caves or whatever.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.340]   We find ourselves in this world and we're curious.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.940]   We also, it's important to be able to explain
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.700]   what happens when there are fires,
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.840]   when there are not fires,
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.040]   what animals and plants are good to eat and all that stuff.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.700]   But we're also just curious.
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.060]   We look up in the sky and we see the sun
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.980]   and the moon and the stars and we see some of those move
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.180]   and we're very curious about that.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.860]   And I think we're just naturally curious.
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.860]   So we make, this is my version of how we work.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.060]   We make up stories and explanations.
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:25.020]   And there are two things which I think
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.580]   are just true of being human.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.060]   We make judgments fast because we have to.
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.060]   We're to survive, is that a tiger or is that not a tiger?
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.460]   And we go.
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.420]   Act.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.180]   We have to act fast on incomplete information.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.020]   So we judge quickly and we're often wrong,
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.220]   or at least sometimes wrong,
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.140]   which is all I need for this.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.560]   We're often wrong.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.560]   So we fool ourselves and we fool other people readily.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.940]   And so there's lots of stories that get told
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.320]   and some of them result in a concrete benefit
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.620]   and some of them don't.
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.420]   - So you said we're often wrong,
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.460]   but what does it mean to be right?
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.980]   - Right, that's an excellent question.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.380]   To be right, well, since I believe
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.220]   that there is a real world,
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.300]   I believe that to be, you can challenge me on this
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.500]   if you're not a realist.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.020]   A realist is somebody who believes
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.260]   in this real objective world
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.060]   which is independent of our perception.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.660]   If I'm a realist, I think that to be right
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.220]   is to come closer.
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.220]   I think, first of all, there's a relative scale.
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.500]   There's not right and wrong.
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.960]   There's right or more right and less right.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.100]   And you're more right if you come closer
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.060]   to an exact, true description of that real world.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.820]   Now, can we know that for sure?
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.100]   No.
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.900]   - And the scientific method is ultimately
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.660]   what allows us to get a sense
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.060]   of how close we're getting to that real world?
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.180]   - No on two counts.
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.020]   First of all, I don't believe there's a scientific method.
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.740]   I was very influenced when I was in graduate school
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.820]   by the writings of Paul Feyerabend
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.740]   who was an important philosopher of science
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.340]   who argued that there isn't a scientific method.
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.180]   - There is or there isn't?
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.020]   - There is not.
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:20.980]   - There's not.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.860]   Can you elaborate?
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.820]   Sorry if you were going to,
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.360]   but can you elaborate on the,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.840]   what does it mean for there not to be a scientific method,
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.100]   this notion that I think a lot of people believe in
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.860]   in this day and age?
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.100]   - Sure.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.780]   Paul Feyerabend, he was a student of Popper
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.340]   who taught Karl Popper.
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.340]   And Feyerabend argued both by logic
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:51.420]   and by historical example that you name anything
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.060]   that should be part of the practice of science,
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.180]   say you should always make sure that your theories
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.240]   agree with all the data that's already been taken.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.640]   And he'll prove to you that there have to be times
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.320]   when science contradicts, when some scientist
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   contradicts that advice for science to progress overall.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:18.280]   So it's not a simple matter.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.280]   I think that, I think of science as a community.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.440]   - Of people.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.160]   - Of people, and as a community of people
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.160]   bound by certain ethical precepts, percepts, whatever that is.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.540]   - So in that community, a set of ideas they operate under,
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:44.400]   meaning ethically, of kind of the rules of the game
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.480]   they operate under.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.020]   - Don't lie, report all your results,
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.020]   whether they agree or don't agree with your hypothesis.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:56.040]   Check the training of a scientist,
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.320]   mostly consists of methods of checking,
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.460]   because again, we make lots of mistakes,
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.700]   we're very error prone.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.640]   But there are tools, both on the mathematics side
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.380]   and the experimental side, to check and double check
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.000]   and triple check.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.400]   And a scientist goes through a training,
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   and I think this is part of it.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.200]   You can't just walk off the street and say,
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.640]   "Yo, I'm a scientist."
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.280]   You have to go through the training,
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:27.280]   and the training, the test that lets you be done
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.560]   with the training is, can you form a convincing case
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.800]   for something that your colleagues
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.560]   will not be able to shout down,
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.440]   because they'll ask, "Did you check this,
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.140]   "and did you check that, and did you check this,
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.680]   "and what about a seeming contradiction with this?"
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.240]   And you've gotta have answers to all those things
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.800]   or you don't get taken seriously.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.560]   And when you get to the point where you can produce
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.960]   that kind of defense and argument,
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.480]   then they give you a PhD.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.900]   And you're kind of licensed.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.000]   You're still gonna be questioned,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.660]   and you still may propose or publish mistakes,
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.480]   but the community is gonna have to waste less time
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.840]   fixing your mistakes.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.240]   - Yes, but if you can maybe linger on it a little longer,
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.240]   what's the gap between the thing that that community does
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.640]   and the ideal of the scientific method?
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.840]   The scientific method is you should be able
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.840]   to repeat an experiment.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:39.440]   There's a lot of elements to what construes
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.980]   the scientific method, but the final result,
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.720]   the hope of it, is that you should be able to say
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.160]   with some confidence that a particular thing
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.040]   is close to the truth.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.440]   - Right, but there's not a simple relationship
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.600]   between experiment and hypothesis or theory.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.120]   For example, Galileo did this experiment
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.460]   of dropping a ball from the top of a tower,
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.880]   and it falls right at the base of the tower.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.480]   And Aristotelian would say, "Wow, of course it falls
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.700]   "right to the base of the tower.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.380]   "That shows that the Earth isn't moving
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.760]   "while the ball is falling."
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.800]   And Galileo says no weight is a principle of inertia
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.320]   and it has an inertia in the direction
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.400]   with the Earth isn't moving and the tower
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.880]   and the ball and the Earth all move together.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.120]   When the principle of inertia tells you it hits the bottom,
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.040]   it does look, therefore my principle of inertia is right.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.320]   And Aristotelian says no, Aristotle's science is right,
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.440]   the Earth is stationary.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.440]   And so you've got to get an interconnected bunch of cases
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.200]   and work hard to line up and explain.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.880]   It took centuries to make the transition
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.920]   from Aristotelian physics to the new physics.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.920]   It wasn't done till Newton in 1680-something, 1687.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.000]   - So what do you think is the nature of the process
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   that seems to lead to progress?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.160]   If we at least look at the long arc of science,
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.420]   of all the community of scientists,
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.000]   they seem to do a better job of coming up with ideas
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.160]   that engineers can then take on and build rockets with
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.160]   or build computers with or build cool stuff with.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.620]   - I don't know, a better job than what?
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.520]   - Than this previous century.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.840]   So century by century, we'll talk about string theory
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.040]   and so on and kind of possible,
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.040]   what you might think of as dead ends and so on.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.640]   - Which is not the way I think of string theory.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.880]   We'll straighten it out, we'll get on string straight.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.920]   But there is, nevertheless, in science,
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.040]   very often at least temporary dead ends.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:57.040]   But if you look through centuries,
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.120]   you know, the century before Newton
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.080]   and the century after Newton,
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:06.080]   it seems like a lot of ideas came closer to the truth
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.240]   that then could be usable by our civilization
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.920]   to build the iPhone, right?
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.900]   To build cool things that improve our quality of life.
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.480]   That's the progress I'm kind of referring to.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.440]   - Let me, can I say that more precisely?
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.280]   - Yes.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.120]   (laughing)
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.940]   It's a low bar.
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.240]   - 'Cause I think it's important to get
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.680]   the time places right.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.840]   - Yes.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.640]   - There was a scientific revolution that partly succeeded
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:39.520]   between about 1900 or late 1890s
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.520]   and into the 1930s, 1940s,
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.840]   and maybe some, if you stretched it, into the 1970s.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.520]   And the technology, this was the discovery of relativity
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.120]   and that included a lot of developments
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.320]   of electromagnetism.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.600]   The confirmation, which wasn't really well confirmed
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.560]   into the 20th century, that matter was made of atoms.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.680]   And the whole picture of nuclei
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.880]   with electrons going around,
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.520]   this is early 20th century.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.520]   And then quantum mechanics was from 1905,
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.760]   took a long time to develop to the late 1920s
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.280]   and then it was basically in final form.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.440]   And the basis of this partial revolution,
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.440]   and we can come back to why it's only a partial revolution,
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.060]   is the basis of the technologies you mentioned.
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.840]   All of, I mean, electrical technology
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.880]   was being developed slowly with this.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.000]   And in fact, there's a close relation
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.560]   between the development of electricity
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:54.120]   and the electrification of cities in the United States
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.620]   and Europe and so forth.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.300]   And the development of the science.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:05.280]   The fundamental physics,
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.540]   since the early 1970s,
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.220]   doesn't have a story like that so far.
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:16.220]   There's not a series of triumphs and progresses
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.780]   and there's not any practical application.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:26.060]   - So just to linger briefly on the early 20th century
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.080]   and the revolutions in science that happened there,
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.980]   what was the method by which the scientific community
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.940]   kept each other in check about
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.160]   when you get something right, when you get something wrong?
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.620]   Is experimental validation ultimately the final test?
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.340]   - It's absolutely necessary.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.640]   And the key things were all validated.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.940]   The key predictions of quantum mechanics
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.300]   and of the theory of electricity and magnetism.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.940]   - So before we talk about Einstein,
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.740]   your new book before string theory, quantum mechanics,
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.060]   let's take a step back at a higher level question.
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.380]   What is, that you mentioned, what is realism?
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.620]   What is anti-realism?
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.860]   And maybe why do you find realism,
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.720]   as you mentioned, so compelling?
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:22.180]   - Realism is the belief in an external world
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:28.700]   independent of our existence, our perception,
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.740]   our belief, our knowledge.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:35.540]   A realist, as a physicist, is somebody who believes
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.340]   that there should be possible
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.260]   some completely objective description
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:46.860]   of each and every process at the fundamental level,
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:51.060]   which describes and explains exactly what happens
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.820]   and why it happens.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.700]   - That kind of implies that that system,
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.340]   in a realist view, is deterministic,
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.160]   meaning there's no fuzzy magic going on
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.380]   that you can never get to the bottom of.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.340]   You can get to the bottom of anything
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.260]   and perfectly describe it.
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.740]   - Some people would say that I'm not that interested
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.740]   in determinism, but I could live with the fundamental world,
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.580]   which had some chance in it.
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.800]   - So do you, you said you could live with it,
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.580]   but do you think God plays dice in our universe?
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.820]   - I think it's probably much worse than that.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.120]   - In which direction?
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.940]   - I think that theories can change
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.140]   and theories can change without warning.
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.540]   I think the future is open.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.900]   - You mean the fundamental laws of physics can change?
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.740]   - Yeah.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.860]   - Okay, we'll get there.
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.940]   (laughs)
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.700]   I thought we would be able to find some solid ground,
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.540]   but apparently--
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.380]   - Well, the ground is pretty solid.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.180]   - The entirety of it, temporarily so.
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:00.140]   Okay, so realism is the idea that while the ground is solid,
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.900]   you can describe it.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.660]   What's the role of the human being,
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:09.660]   our beautiful, complex human mind in realism?
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:14.780]   Do we have a, are we just another set of molecules
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.460]   connected together in a clever way?
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:21.060]   Or the observer, does the observer,
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.260]   our human mind, consciousness, have a role
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.340]   in this realism view of the physical universe?
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.420]   - There's two ways, there's two questions
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.420]   you could be asking.
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:35.700]   Does our conscious mind, do our perceptions
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.860]   play a role in making things become,
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.340]   in making things real or things becoming?
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.340]   That's question one.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.420]   Question two is, does this, we can call it
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.940]   a naturalist view of the world
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:56.100]   that is based on realism, allow a place
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.820]   to understand the existence of and the nature
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.820]   of perceptions and consciousness in mind?
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.260]   And that's question two.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.660]   Question two, I do think a lot about,
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:11.180]   and my answer, which is not an answer, is I hope so.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.700]   But it certainly doesn't yet.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.180]   - So what-- - Question one,
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.060]   I don't think so.
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.740]   But of course, the answer to question one
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.180]   depends on question two.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.020]   - Right.
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.060]   - So I'm not up to question one.
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.780]   - So question two is the thing that you can
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.540]   kind of struggle with at this time.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.100]   What about the anti-realists?
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.260]   So what flavor, what are the different camps
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.460]   of anti-realists that you've talked about?
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.980]   I think it would be nice if you could articulate
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.180]   for the people for whom there is not
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.500]   a very concrete real world, or there's divisions,
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.300]   or it's messier than the realist view of the universe.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.300]   What are the different camps?
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.700]   What are the different views?
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.380]   - I'm not sure I'm a good scholar
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.020]   and can talk about the different camps and analyze it.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:04.620]   But some, many of the inventors of quantum physics
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.820]   were not realists, were anti-realists.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:11.060]   And there are scholars, they lived in a very perilous time
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.880]   between the two world wars.
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.540]   And there were a lot of trends in culture
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.300]   which were going that way.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.900]   But in any case, they said things like
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:27.420]   the purpose of science is not to give an objective
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.780]   realist description of nature as it would be in our absence.
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.100]   This might be saying Niels Bohr.
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.380]   The purpose of science is as an extension
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.820]   of our conversations with each other,
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.380]   to describe our interactions with nature.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.380]   And we're free to invent and use terms like particle,
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.800]   or wave, or causality, or time, or space,
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.000]   if they're useful to us and they carry
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.520]   some intuitive implication.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.400]   But we shouldn't believe that they actually have to do
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.540]   with what nature would be like in our absence,
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.640]   which we have nothing to say about.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.140]   - Do you find any aspect of that,
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.500]   'cause you kind of said that we human beings tell stories.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.980]   Do you find aspects of that kind of anti-realist view
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.820]   of Niels Bohr compelling?
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.980]   That we're fundamentally are storytellers,
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.540]   and then we create tools of space and time,
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.260]   and causality, and whatever this fun
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.180]   quantum mechanics stuff is to help us
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.800]   tell the story of our world.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.300]   - Sure, I just would like to believe
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.520]   it is an aspiration for the other thing.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.420]   - The other thing being what?
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.020]   - The realist point of view.
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.340]   - Do you hope that the stories will eventually lead us
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:52.340]   to discovering the real world as it is?
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:57.560]   - Yeah.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.220]   - Is perfection possible, by the way?
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.060]   - No.
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:05.180]   You mean, will we ever get there and know that we're there?
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.500]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.820]   - That's for people 5,000 years in the future.
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.780]   We're certainly nowhere near there yet.
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:19.220]   - Do you think reality that exists outside of our mind,
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:24.620]   do you think there's a limit to our cognitive abilities,
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.820]   as again, descendants of apes,
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.820]   who are just biological systems?
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.780]   Is there a limit to our mind's capability
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.740]   to actually understand reality?
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:40.380]   There comes a point, even with the help
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.060]   of the tools of physics, that we just cannot grasp
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.820]   some fundamental aspects of that reality.
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.220]   - Again, I think that's a question
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.820]   for 5,000 years in the future.
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.140]   - We're not even close to that limit.
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.060]   - I think there is a universality.
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.900]   Here, I don't agree with David Deutsch about everything,
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.260]   but I admire the way he put things in his last book.
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.540]   And he talked about the role of explanation.
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:08.820]   And he talked about the universality of certain languages,
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.060]   or the universality of mathematics,
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:15.740]   or of computing, and so forth.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.420]   And he believed that universality,
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:22.260]   which is something real, which somehow comes out
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.020]   of the fact that a symbolic system,
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.580]   or a mathematical system, can refer to itself,
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.140]   and can, I forget what that's called,
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.900]   can reference back to itself.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:37.020]   And build, in which he argued for a universality
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.500]   of possibility for our understanding,
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.380]   whatever is out there.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.300]   But I admire that argument.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:50.300]   But it seems to me we're doing okay so far,
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.860]   but we'll have to see.
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.180]   - Whether there is a limit or not.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.260]   For now, we've got plenty to play with.
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.340]   - Yeah.
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.780]   There are things which are right there in front of us,
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.660]   which we miss.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:07.620]   And I'll quote my friend Eric Weinstein in saying,
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.540]   look, Einstein carried his luggage.
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.060]   Freud carried his luggage.
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.420]   Marx carried his luggage.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.020]   Martha Graham carried her luggage, et cetera.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.260]   Edison carried his luggage.
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.020]   All these geniuses carried their luggage.
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.620]   And not once before, relatively recently,
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.180]   did it occur to anybody to put a wheel on luggage
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.020]   and pull it.
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:30.500]   (laughing)
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.060]   And it was right there waiting to be invented
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.620]   for centuries.
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.980]   - So this is Eric Weinstein.
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.540]   Yeah, what do the wheels represent?
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.180]   Are you basically saying that there's stuff
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:45.180]   right in front of our eyes that once we,
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.260]   it just clicks, we put the wheels in the luggage,
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.900]   a lot of things will fall into place?
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.420]   - Yes, I do, I do.
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.140]   And every day I wake up and think,
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.580]   why can't I be that guy who was walking through the airport?
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.700]   - What do you think it takes to be that guy?
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:07.140]   Because like you said, a lot of really smart people
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.580]   carried their luggage.
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:12.460]   What, just psychologically speaking,
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.580]   so Eric Weinstein is a good example of a person
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.140]   who thinks outside the box.
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:16.980]   - Yes.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:21.060]   - Who resists almost conventional thinking.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.460]   You're an example of a person who,
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:28.460]   by habit, by psychology, by upbringing, I don't know,
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.980]   but resists conventional thinking as well, just by nature.
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:32.900]   - Thank you, that's a compliment.
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.100]   - That's a compliment?
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.260]   Good, so what do you think it takes to do that?
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.360]   Is that something you were just born with?
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.060]   - I doubt it.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:47.020]   Well, from my studying some cases,
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.860]   'cause I'm curious about that, obviously,
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.520]   and just in a more concrete way,
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.420]   when I started out in physics,
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.860]   'cause I started a long way from physics,
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:00.820]   so it took me a long, not a long time,
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.300]   but a lot of work to get to study it and get into it,
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.860]   so I did wonder about that.
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.420]   And so I read the biographies,
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.980]   and in fact, I started with the autobiography of Weinstein
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.980]   and Newton and Galileo and all those people.
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:22.780]   And I think there's a couple things.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.900]   Some of it is luck, being in the right place
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.340]   at the right time.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.820]   Some of it is stubbornness and arrogance,
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:30.460]   which can easily go wrong.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.980]   - Yes.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:36.300]   - And I know all of these are doorways,
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.980]   if you go through them slightly at the wrong speed
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:43.980]   or in the wrong angle, they're ways to fail.
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.620]   But if you somehow have the right luck,
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:52.060]   the right confidence and arrogance, caring,
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:56.020]   I think Einstein cared to understand nature
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:00.140]   with a ferocity and a commitment
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.220]   that exceeded other people of his time.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.060]   So he asked more stubborn questions,
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.120]   he asked deeper questions.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:14.940]   I think, and there's a level of ability,
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:20.020]   and whether ability is born in or can be developed
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.700]   to the extent to which it can be developed,
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.480]   like any of these things, like musical talent.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.060]   - You mentioned ego.
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.980]   What's the role of ego in that process?
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.060]   - Confidence.
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:33.740]   - Confidence, but in your own life,
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.440]   have you found yourself walking that nice edge
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.900]   of too much or too little?
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.520]   So being overconfident and therefore leading yourself astray
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.820]   or not sufficiently confident to throw away
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:49.260]   the conventional thinking of whatever the theory of the day,
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.540]   of theoretical physics?
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.260]   - I don't know if I, I mean, I've contributed
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.380]   where I've contributed, whether if I had had
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:01.340]   more confidence in something, I would have gotten further.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.220]   I don't know.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:08.980]   Certainly, I'm sitting here at this moment
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:14.500]   with very much my own approach to nearly everything.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.860]   And I'm calm, I'm happy about that.
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.860]   But on the other hand, I know people
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:26.660]   whose self-confidence vastly exceeds mine,
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.500]   and sometimes I think it's justified,
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.660]   and sometimes I think it's not justified.
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:35.220]   - Your most recent book titled
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.740]   "Einstein's Unfinished Revolution,"
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:42.220]   so I have to ask, what is Einstein's unfinished revolution?
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.420]   And also, how do we finish it?
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.260]   - Well, that's something I've been trying
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.380]   to do my whole life.
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.220]   But Einstein's unfinished revolution
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.860]   is the twin revolutions which invented relativity theory,
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.140]   special and especially general relativity,
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.260]   and quantum theory, which he was the first person
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:04.900]   to realize in 1905 that there would have to be
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.860]   a radically different theory which somehow realized
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.220]   or resolved the paradox of the duality
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.320]   of particle and wave for photons.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.060]   - And he was, I mean, people, I think,
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.180]   don't always associate Einstein with quantum mechanics,
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.380]   'cause I think his connection with it,
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.420]   founding, as one of the founders, I would say,
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.460]   of quantum mechanics, he kind of put it in the closet.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.300]   Is it--
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.980]   - Well, he didn't believe that the quantum mechanics,
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:38.160]   as it was developed in the late 19th, middle late 1920s,
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.540]   was completely correct.
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.140]   At first, he didn't believe it at all.
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.180]   Then he was convinced that it's consistent but incomplete,
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.260]   and that also is my view.
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:52.060]   It needs, for various reasons I can elucidate,
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:56.020]   to have additional degrees of freedom,
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:00.680]   particles, forces, something, to reach the stage
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.980]   where it gives a complete description of each phenomenon,
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:07.620]   as I was saying, realism demands.
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.260]   - So what aspect of quantum mechanics bothers you
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.940]   and Einstein the most?
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:17.940]   Is it some aspect of the wave function collapse discussions,
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.860]   the measurement problem?
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.580]   Is it the--
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.140]   - The measurement problem.
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.140]   I'm not gonna speak for Einstein.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.700]   (Lex laughing)
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.900]   The measurement problem, basically, and the fact that--
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.100]   - What is the measurement problem, sorry?
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.860]   - The basic formulation of quantum mechanics
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:41.100]   gives you two ways to evolve situations in time.
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.900]   One of them is explicitly when no observer is observing
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.180]   or no measurement is taking place,
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.700]   and the other is when a measurement
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.460]   or an observation is taking place,
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.940]   and they basically contradict each other.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.700]   But there's another reason why the revolution
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.660]   was incomplete, which is we don't understand
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.220]   the relationship between these two parts,
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:04.700]   general relativity, which became our best theory
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.700]   of space and time and gravitation and cosmology,
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.760]   and quantum theory.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.120]   - So for the most part, general relativity
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.960]   describes big things, quantum theory describes
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.680]   little things, and that's the revolution
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.360]   that we found really powerful tools
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.040]   to describe big things and little things,
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.400]   and it's unfinished because we have
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.080]   two totally separate things, and we need to figure out
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.360]   how to connect them so it can describe everything.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.120]   - Right, and we either do that,
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.480]   if we believe quantum mechanics, as understood now,
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.120]   is correct, by bringing general relativity
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.160]   or some extension of general relativity
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.520]   that describes gravity and so forth
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.680]   into the quantum domain that's called quantized,
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:54.440]   the theory of gravity, or if you believe
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.880]   with Einstein that quantum mechanics
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.400]   needs to be completed, and this is my view,
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.880]   then part of the job of finding the right completion
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.120]   or extension of quantum mechanics
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.340]   would be one that incorporated space-time and gravity.
[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.960]   - So, where do we begin?
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.640]   So first, let me ask, perhaps you can give me a chance,
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.120]   if I could ask you some just really basic questions,
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.320]   well, they're not at all, the basic questions
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.760]   are the hardest, but you mentioned space-time.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.920]   What is space-time?
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.280]   - Space-time, you talked about a construction,
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.440]   so I believe that space-time is an intellectual construction
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.200]   that we make of the events in the universe.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.680]   I believe the events are real,
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.520]   and the relationships between the events,
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.440]   which cause which are real, but the idea
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:51.440]   that there's a four-dimensional smooth geometry
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.000]   which has a metric and a connection
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.320]   and satisfies the equations that Einstein wrote,
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.400]   it's a good description to some scale,
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.440]   it's a good approximation, it captures
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.080]   some of what's really going on in nature,
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.600]   but I don't believe it for a minute is fundamental.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.440]   - So, okay, we're gonna, allow me to linger on that.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.720]   So the universe has events, events cause other events,
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:21.720]   this is the idea of causality, okay, so that's real.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.520]   - That's in my-- - In your view, is real.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.100]   - Or hypothesis, or the theories that I have been
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.200]   working to develop make that assumption.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.320]   So space-time, you said four-dimensional space
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.200]   is kind of the location of things,
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:42.240]   and time is whatever the heck time is,
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:47.240]   and you're saying that space-time is,
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.480]   both space and time are emergent and not fundamental?
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.460]   - No. - Sorry, before you correct me,
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:58.760]   what does it mean to be fundamental or emergent?
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.500]   - Fundamental means it's part of the description
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.720]   as far down as you go, we have this notion.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.160]   - As real. - Yes.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.280]   - As real as real could be.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.200]   - Yeah, so I think that time is fundamental,
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:14.480]   and quote goes all the way down, and space does not,
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.680]   and the combination of them we use in general relativity
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.840]   that we call space-time also does not.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.120]   - But what is time, then?
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:29.120]   - I think that time, the activity of time
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:34.380]   is a continual creation of events from existing events.
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:37.580]   - So if there's no events, there's no time.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:41.120]   - Then there's not only no time, there's no nothing.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.460]   - So-- - So I believe the universe
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.780]   has a history which goes to the past.
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.740]   I believe the future does not exist.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:55.500]   There's a notion of a present and a notion of the past,
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:00.380]   and the past consists of, is a story about events
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.640]   that took place to our past.
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.540]   - So you said the future doesn't exist.
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:06.380]   - Yes.
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.220]   - Could you say that again?
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.100]   Can you try to give me a chance to understand that
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.280]   one more time?
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.480]   So events cause other events.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.420]   What is this universe?
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:23.580]   'Cause we'll talk about locality and non-locality.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.100]   - Good.
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.140]   'Cause it's a crazy, I mean, it's not crazy,
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:32.140]   it's a beautiful set of ideas that you propose.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.660]   But, and if causality is fundamental,
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.100]   I'd just like to understand it better.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.980]   What is the past, what is the future,
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:44.580]   what is the flow of time, even the error of time
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.680]   in our universe, in your view?
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.300]   And maybe what's an event?
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.660]   Right? - Oh, an event is
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:55.860]   where something changes, or where two,
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:02.220]   it's hard to say because it's a primitive concept.
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:07.220]   An event is a moment of time within space,
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:11.480]   this is the view in general relativity,
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:15.460]   where two particles intersect in their paths,
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:19.740]   or something changes in the path of a particle.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.600]   Now, we are postulating that there is,
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.620]   at the fundamental level, a notion,
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.220]   which is an elementary notion,
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:31.460]   so it doesn't have a definition in terms of other things,
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.780]   but it is something elementary happening.
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.900]   - And it doesn't have a connection to energy,
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:37.740]   or matter, or exchange of any--
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.140]   - It does have a connection to energy and matter.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.700]   - So it's at that level.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.980]   - Yes, it involves, and that's why the version
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:49.700]   of a theory of events that I've developed
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.540]   with Marina Cortes, and by the way,
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.040]   I want to mention my collaborators,
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.940]   because they've been at least as important
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.100]   in this work as I have, as Marina Cortes
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:04.100]   in all the works since about 2013, 2012, 2013,
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:08.260]   about causality, causal sets, and in the period
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:11.220]   before that, Roberto Manguibara Unger,
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.780]   who is a philosopher and a professor of law.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.900]   - And that's in your efforts together
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:20.100]   with your collaborators to finish the unfinished revolution.
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.100]   - Yes. - And focus on causality
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.380]   as a fundamental-- - Yes.
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:25.860]   - As fundamental to physics.
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:30.380]   - And there's certainly other people we've worked with,
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.700]   but those two people's thinking
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.940]   had a huge influence on my own thinking.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.780]   - So in the way you describe causality,
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.460]   that's what you mean of time being fundamental,
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.700]   that causality is fundamental.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.540]   - Yes.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:47.360]   - And what does it mean for space to not be fundamental,
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.880]   to be emergent? - That's very good.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.280]   That there's a level of description
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.920]   in which there are events, there are events
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:59.320]   create other events, but there's no space.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.760]   They don't live in space.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:04.040]   They have an order in which they caused each other,
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.600]   and that is part of the nature of time for us.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.720]   But there is an emergent approximate description,
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.120]   and you asked me to define emergent, I didn't.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:22.160]   An emergent property is a property
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:26.500]   that arises at some level of complexity,
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:31.280]   larger than and more complex than the fundamental level,
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:36.160]   which requires some property to describe it,
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:41.160]   which is not directly explicable or derivable,
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.640]   is the word I want,
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.680]   from the properties of the fundamental things.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:50.860]   - And space is one of those things
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.160]   in a sufficiently complex universe,
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:58.160]   space, three-dimensional position of things emerged.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:03.000]   - Yes, and we have this, we saw how this happens in detail
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.680]   in some models, both computationally and analytically.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:11.280]   - Okay, so connected to space is the idea of locality.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.120]   - Yes.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.240]   - So we talked about realism.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:19.860]   So I live in this world, I like sports.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:25.440]   Locality is a thing that you can affect things close to you
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:29.880]   and don't have an effect on things that are far away.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.880]   It's the thing that bothers me about gravity in general,
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.120]   or action at a distance.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.400]   Same thing that probably bothered Newton,
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.080]   or at least he said a little bit about it.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.560]   Okay, so what do you think about locality?
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.980]   Is it just a construct?
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:51.680]   Is it us humans just like this idea
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.200]   and are connected to it because we exist in it,
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.120]   we need it for our survival, but it's not fundamental?
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.920]   I mean, it seems crazy for it not to be
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.920]   a fundamental aspect of our reality.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.760]   - It does.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.840]   - So can you comfort me, sort of as a therapist?
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.440]   - I'm not a good therapist, but I'll do my best.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.280]   - Okay.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:16.820]   - There are several different definitions of locality
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:19.620]   when you come to talk about locality in physics.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:25.520]   In quantum field theory, which is a mixture
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.640]   of special relativity and quantum mechanics,
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.640]   there is a precise definition of locality.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:37.560]   Field operators corresponding to events in space-time,
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.320]   which are spaced like separated commute
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.440]   with each other as operators.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.240]   - So in quantum mechanics, you think about
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.200]   the nature of reality as fields,
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.760]   and things that are close in a field
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:53.000]   have an impact on each other more than farther away.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.200]   - That's, yes.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.560]   That's very comforting.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.400]   That makes sense.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.400]   - So that's a property of quantum field theory,
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.360]   and it's well-tested.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:04.920]   Unfortunately, there's another definition of local,
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.680]   which was expressed by Einstein,
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.100]   and expressed more precisely by John Bell,
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:15.740]   which has been tested experimentally and found to fail.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:19.620]   And this setup is you take two particles.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:24.000]   So one thing that's really weird about quantum mechanics
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.520]   is a property called entanglement.
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.920]   You can have two particles interact
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.720]   and then share a property without it being a property
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.440]   of either one of the two particles.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.520]   And if you take such a system,
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:43.480]   and then you make a measurement on particle A,
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.080]   which is over here on my right side,
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.240]   and particle B, which is over here,
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.780]   somebody else makes a measurement on particle B,
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:57.140]   you can ask that wherever is the real reality of particle B,
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:01.980]   it not be affected by the choice
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:04.660]   the observer at particle A makes about what to measure.
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:07.100]   Not the outcome, just the choice
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.680]   of the different things they might measure.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.420]   And that's a notion of locality,
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.220]   because it assumes that these things
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:16.060]   are very far space-like separated,
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.060]   and it's gonna take a while for any information
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.180]   about the choice made by the people here at A
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.100]   to affect the reality at B.
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.620]   But you make that assumption, that's called Bell locality.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.140]   And you derive a certain inequality
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.460]   that some correlations,
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:36.060]   functions of correlations have to satisfy.
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:39.380]   And then you can test that pretty directly
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.300]   in experiments which create pairs of photons
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.020]   or other particles.
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.820]   And it's wrong by many sigma.
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:49.940]   - In experiment, it doesn't match.
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:51.860]   So what does that mean?
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.860]   - That means that that definition
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.460]   of locality I stated is false.
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.860]   - The one that Einstein was playing with?
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.740]   - Yeah, and the one that I stated,
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:04.780]   that is, it's not true that whatever is real
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:08.700]   about particle B is unaffected by the choice
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.980]   that the observer makes as to what to measure
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:14.620]   in particle A, no matter how long they've been propagating
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:15.980]   at almost the speed of light,
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:18.460]   or the speed of light away from each other.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:22.020]   - No matter, so like the distance between them?
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.660]   - Well, it's been tested, of course,
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:27.540]   if you want to have hope for quantum mechanics
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.140]   being incomplete or wrong,
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:32.460]   and corrected by something that changes this.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.900]   It's been tested over a number of kilometers.
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:39.420]   I don't remember whether it's 25 kilometers
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.140]   or 100 and something kilometers.
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:47.140]   So in trying to solve the unsolved revolution,
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:50.180]   in trying to come up with a theory for everything,
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:55.180]   is causality fundamental and breaking away from locality?
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:58.380]   - Absolutely.
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.420]   - A crucial step.
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:02.460]   So in your book, essentially,
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.660]   those are the two things we really need
[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:07.860]   to think about as a community,
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.500]   especially the physics community has to think about this.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:15.700]   So I guess my question is, how do we solve,
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.140]   how do we finish the unfinished revolution?
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.780]   - Well, that's, I can only tell you what I'm trying to do,
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.380]   and what I have abandoned.
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.080]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.900]   - As not working.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.920]   - As one ant, smart ant in an ant colony.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.940]   - Or maybe dumb, that's why, who knows?
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:40.260]   But anyway, my view of the,
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:43.100]   we've had some nice theories invented.
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:47.220]   There's a bunch of different ones,
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.620]   both relate to quantum mechanics,
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.900]   relate to quantum gravity.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:56.780]   There's a lot to admire in many of these different approaches
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.580]   but to my understanding,
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:04.100]   none of them completely solve the problems that I care about.
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:08.020]   And so we're in a situation
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.860]   which is either terrifying for a student
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:14.980]   or full of opportunity for the right student,
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:19.580]   in which we've got more than a dozen attempts,
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:22.180]   and I never thought, I don't think anybody anticipated
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.940]   it would work out this way, which worked partly,
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:27.640]   and then at some point, they have an issue
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.900]   that nobody can figure out how to go around
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:30.940]   or how to solve.
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:36.120]   And that's the situation we're in.
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.560]   My reaction to that is twofold.
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.680]   One of them is to try to bring people,
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:46.940]   we evolved into this unfortunate sociological situation
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.840]   in which there are communities
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.700]   around some of these approaches.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.780]   And to borrow again a metaphor from Eric,
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:58.020]   they sit on top of hills in the landscape of theories
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.420]   and throw rocks at each other.
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.900]   And as Eric says, we need two things.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.460]   We need people to get off their hills
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.700]   and come down into the valleys and party and talk
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:12.940]   and become friendly and learn to say
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:17.860]   not no but, but yes and.
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:19.700]   Yes, your idea goes this far,
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.840]   but maybe if we put it together with my idea,
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.980]   we can go further.
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.820]   - Yes.
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:29.340]   So in that spirit, I've talked several times
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:32.700]   with Sean Carroll, who's also written
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.260]   an excellent book recently.
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.900]   And he kind of, he plays around,
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.020]   is a big fan of the many worlds interpretation
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:40.460]   of quantum mechanics.
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:44.460]   So I'm a troublemaker, so let me ask,
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:47.300]   what's your sense of Sean
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:50.020]   and the idea of many worlds interpretation?
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.780]   I've read many, the commentary back and forth.
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.820]   You guys are friendly, respect each other,
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:57.420]   but have a lot of fun debating.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:02.300]   - I love Sean and he, no, I really,
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:07.300]   he's articulate and he's a great representative
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.300]   or ambassador of science to the public
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.400]   and for different fields of science to each other.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:19.300]   He also, like I do, takes philosophy seriously.
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:24.380]   And unlike what I do in all cases,
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.460]   he's really done the homework.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:29.160]   He's read a lot, he knows the people,
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:34.160]   he talks to them, he exposes his arguments to them.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:37.540]   And I, there's this mysterious thing
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.700]   that we so often end up on the opposite sides
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:41.820]   of one of these issues.
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:43.100]   - It's fun though.
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:47.740]   - It's fun and I'd love to have a conversation about that,
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:50.140]   but I would want to include him.
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:51.660]   - I see, about many worlds.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:52.500]   Well--
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.060]   - No, I can tell you what I think about many worlds.
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.220]   - I'd love to, but actually on that, let me pause.
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.960]   Sean has a podcast, you should definitely figure out
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.700]   how to talk to Sean.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.060]   I actually told Sean I would love to hear you guys
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.060]   just going back and forth.
[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:07.540]   So I hope you can make that happen eventually,
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:08.380]   you and Sean.
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:09.600]   - I won't tell you what it is,
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.180]   but there's something that Sean said to me
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:17.180]   in June of 2016 that changed my whole approach to a problem.
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:19.260]   But I have to tell him first.
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:23.300]   - Yes, and that'll be great to tell him on his podcast.
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:24.140]   So--
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:26.260]   - I can invite myself to his podcast.
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:28.580]   - I told him, yeah, okay, we'll make it happen.
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.020]   So many worlds.
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:30.860]   - Anyway.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.560]   - What's your view?
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.840]   Many worlds, we talked about non-locality.
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:39.800]   Many worlds is also a very uncomfortable idea
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.440]   or beautiful, depending on your perspective.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:48.440]   It's very nice in terms of,
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.600]   I mean, there's a realist aspect to it.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.580]   I think you called it magical realism.
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:53.420]   - Yeah.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:54.260]   (laughing)
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.720]   - It's just a beautiful line.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.880]   But at the same time, it's very difficult
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.400]   to for our limited human minds to comprehend.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.240]   So what are your thoughts about it?
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:08.640]   - Let me start with the easy and obvious
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.760]   and then go to the scientific.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.280]   - Okay.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.520]   - It doesn't appeal to me.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:17.720]   It doesn't answer the questions that I want answered.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.460]   And it does so to such a strong case
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:23.280]   that when Roberto Manguibar-Anger and I
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.960]   began looking for principles,
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.400]   and I want to come back and talk about
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.560]   the use of principles in science,
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.180]   'cause that's the other thing I was gonna say,
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:31.680]   and I don't want to lose that.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.640]   When we started looking for principles,
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:37.660]   we made our first principle, there is just one world,
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:39.000]   and it happens once.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.880]   But so it's not helpful to my personal approach,
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:49.040]   to my personal agenda.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.300]   But of course, I'm part of a community.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:57.040]   And my sense of the many worlds interpretation,
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:00.800]   I have thought a lot about it and struggled a lot with it,
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.860]   is the following.
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:07.820]   First of all, there's Everett himself,
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.400]   there's what's in Everett.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:13.560]   And there are several issues there
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.880]   connected with the derivation of the Born Rule,
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:20.960]   which is the rule that gives probabilities to events.
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:25.420]   And the reasons why there is a problem with probability
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:28.480]   is that I mentioned the two ways
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.280]   that physical systems can evolve.
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.360]   The many worlds interpretation cuts off,
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:37.080]   one, the one having to do with measurement,
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.740]   and just has the other one, the Schrodinger evolution,
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:43.020]   which is this smooth evolution of the quantum state.
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:48.720]   But the notion of probability is only in the second rule,
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.820]   which we've thrown away.
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.560]   So where does probability come from?
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.920]   You have to answer the question,
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.680]   because experimentalists use probabilities
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.880]   to check the theory.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:05.000]   Now, at first sight, you get very confused,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.480]   'cause there seems to be a real problem.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:10.880]   Because in the many worlds interpretation,
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.460]   this talk about branches is not quite precise,
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:14.500]   but I'll use it.
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:19.200]   There's a branch in which everything that might happen
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.840]   does happen, with probability one in that branch.
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:27.420]   You might think you could count the number of branches
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:30.240]   in which things do and don't happen,
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.340]   and get numbers that you can define
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.860]   as something like frequentist probabilities.
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:40.200]   And Everett did have an argument in that direction.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:43.260]   But the argument gets very subtle
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.780]   when there are an infinite number of possibilities,
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:48.940]   as is the case in most quantum systems.
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:53.220]   And my understanding, although I'm not as much of an expert
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:58.220]   as some other people, is that Everett's own proposal failed,
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.420]   did not work.
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:05.420]   There are then, but it doesn't stop there.
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:08.540]   There is an important idea that Everett didn't know about,
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:11.260]   which is decoherence, and it is a phenomenon
[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:13.640]   that might be very much relevant.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:19.140]   And so a number of people post-Everett
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:22.320]   have tried to make versions of what you might call
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:24.260]   many worlds quantum mechanics.
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:29.720]   And this is a big area, and it's subtle,
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:33.140]   and it's not the kind of thing that I do well.
[00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:36.260]   So I consulted, that's why there's two chapters on this
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:38.300]   in the book I wrote, chapter 10,
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.800]   which is about Everett's version, and chapter 11.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:45.200]   There's a very good group of philosophers of physics
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:49.480]   in Oxford, Simon Saunders, David Wallace,
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:52.840]   Harvey Brown, and a number of others.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:57.160]   And of course, there's David Deutsch, who is there.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:01.520]   And those people have developed and put a lot of work
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:04.320]   into a very sophisticated set of ideas
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.620]   designed to come back and answer that question.
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:11.440]   They have the flavor of, there are really no probabilities,
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:15.760]   we admit that, but imagine if the Everett story was true
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:18.800]   and you were living in that multiverse,
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.000]   how would you make bets?
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.680]   And so they use decision theory
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:28.680]   from the theory of probability and gambling and so forth
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:33.080]   to shape a story of how you would bet
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:36.540]   if you were inside an Everettian universe and you knew that.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.960]   And there's a debate among those experts
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:46.600]   as to whether they or somebody else has really succeeded.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.800]   And when I checked in as I was finishing the book
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.840]   with some of those people, like Simon,
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:56.640]   who's a good friend of mine, and David Wallace,
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.280]   they told me that they weren't sure
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.180]   that any of them was yet correct.
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:03.840]   So that's what I put in my book.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:08.160]   Now, to add to that, Sean has his own approach
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.760]   to that problem in what's called self-referencing
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.480]   or self-locating observers.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:19.680]   And it doesn't, I tried to read it
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.560]   and it didn't make sense to me,
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.540]   but I didn't study it hard, I didn't communicate with Sean,
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:27.040]   I didn't do the things that I would do,
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:29.360]   so I had nothing to say about it in the book.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:32.840]   I don't know whether it's right or not.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.560]   - Let's talk a little bit about science.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:39.820]   You mentioned the use of principles in science.
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:43.100]   What does it mean to have a principle
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.400]   and why is that important?
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:48.480]   - When I feel very frustrated about quantum gravity,
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.740]   I like to go back and read history.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:56.880]   And of course, Einstein, his achievements are a huge lesson
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:00.880]   and hopefully something like a role model.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:05.200]   And it's very clear that Einstein thought
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:09.080]   that the first job when you want to enter a new domain
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:13.360]   of theoretical physics is to discover and invent principles
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.880]   and then make models of how those principles
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:19.260]   might be applied in some experimental situation,
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:22.440]   which is where the mathematics comes in.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:27.440]   So for Einstein, there was no unified space and time.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.880]   Minkowski invented this idea of space time.
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:33.880]   For Einstein, it was a model of his principles
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.320]   or his postulates.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:41.280]   And I've taken the view that we don't know the principles
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.600]   of quantum gravity.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:47.060]   I can think about candidates and I have some papers
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:50.280]   where I discuss different candidates
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.840]   and I'm happy to discuss them.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:57.000]   But my belief now is that those partially successful
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   approaches are all models which might describe indeed
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.160]   some quantum gravity physics in some domain,
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:12.160]   in some aspect, but ultimately would be important
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.360]   because they model the principles
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:18.360]   and the first job is to tie down those principles.
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:21.440]   So that's the approach that I'm taking.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:26.440]   - So speaking of principles, in your 2006 book,
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:30.920]   The Trouble with Physics, you criticized a bit
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:34.160]   string theory for taking us away from the rigors
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:37.120]   of the scientific method or whatever you would call it.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:42.120]   But what's the trouble with physics today
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.240]   and how do we fix it?
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:47.400]   - Can I say how I read that book?
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.240]   - Sure.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:52.440]   - Because I, and I'm not, this of course has to be my fault
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:55.680]   because you can't as an author claim
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:58.320]   after all the work you put in that you were misread.
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:04.480]   But I will say that many of the reviewers
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.520]   who are not personally involved and even many
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.720]   who were working on string theory
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.400]   or some other approach to quantum gravity
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.360]   told me, communicated with me and told me
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.120]   they thought that I was fair
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:20.840]   and balance was the word that was usually used.
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.120]   So let me tell you what my purpose was
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:28.120]   in writing that book, which clearly got diverted by,
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:33.760]   because there was already a rather hot argument going on.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:36.000]   And this is--
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.600]   - On which topic, on string theory specifically
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:40.180]   or in general in physics?
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:44.060]   - No, more specifically than string theory.
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:47.680]   So since we're in Cambridge, can I say that?
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:48.520]   We're doing this in Cambridge.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:51.120]   - Yeah, of course, Cambridge, just to be clear,
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:55.600]   Massachusetts and on Harvard campus.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:00.600]   - Right, so Andy Strominger is a good friend of mine
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:03.460]   and has been for many, many years.
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:08.460]   And Andy, so originally there was this beautiful idea
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:11.360]   that there were five string theories
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:14.400]   and maybe they would be unified into one.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.560]   And we would discover a way to break that,
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:20.640]   the symmetries of one of those string theories
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.800]   and discover the standard model
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:24.560]   and predict all the properties
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.280]   of the standard model particles,
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:30.080]   like their masses and charges and so forth, coupling constant.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:34.860]   And then there was a bunch of solutions
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:38.500]   to string theory found, which led each of them
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:40.560]   to a different version of particle physics
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:42.700]   with a different phenomenology.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:46.560]   These are called the Calabi-Yau metaphors,
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.280]   named after Yau, who was also here.
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.520]   Not, certainly we've been friends
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.260]   sometime in the past anyway.
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:57.880]   And then there were, nobody was sure,
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.200]   but hundreds of thousands of different versions
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.840]   of string theory.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.620]   And then Andy found there was a way
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:07.480]   to put a certain kind of mathematical curvature
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.440]   called torsion into the solutions.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.860]   And he wrote a paper, "String Theory with Torsion,"
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.840]   in which he discovered there was
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.040]   not formally uncountable, but he was unable
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.560]   to invent any way to count the number of solutions
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.480]   or classify the diverse solutions.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:31.100]   And he wrote that this is worrying
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.880]   because doing phenomenology the old-fashioned way
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.400]   by solving the theory is not gonna work
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.100]   because there's gonna be loads of solutions
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.940]   for editing proposed phenomenology
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.840]   for anything in the experiments.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:47.480]   This hasn't quite worked out that way.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.640]   But nonetheless, he took that worry to me.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:56.640]   We spoke at least once, maybe two or three times about that.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:59.040]   And I got seriously worried about that.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.440]   And this is a little--
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.020]   - Sounds like an anecdote that inspired
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:07.280]   your worry about string theory in general.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.080]   - Well, I tried to solve the problem,
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.960]   and I tried to solve the problem.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.720]   I was reading at that time a lot of biology,
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.280]   a lot of evolutionary theory,
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:22.280]   like Lin-Margulis and Steve Gould and so forth.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:28.080]   And I could take your time to go through the things,
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.400]   but it occurred to me maybe physics
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.960]   was like evolutionary biology,
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.040]   and maybe the laws evolved.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:40.040]   And there was, the biologists talk about a landscape,
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:44.040]   a fitness landscape of DNA sequences
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.800]   or protein sequences or species or something like that.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.360]   And I took their concept and the word landscape
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:54.560]   from theoretical biology and made a scenario
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.080]   about how the universe as a whole could evolve
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:03.520]   to discover the parameters of the standard model.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.640]   And I'm happy to discuss,
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.240]   that's called cosmological natural selection.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.920]   - Cosmological natural selection.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:10.760]   - Yeah, and I--
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.600]   - Wow, so the parameters of the standard model,
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.520]   so it's the laws of physics are changing.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.960]   This idea would say that the laws of physics
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.400]   are changing in some way that echoes
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.880]   that of natural selection,
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.840]   or just it adjusts in some way towards some goal.
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.560]   - Yes, and I published that,
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.600]   I wrote the paper in '88 or '89,
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.120]   the paper was published in '92.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.040]   My first book in 1997,
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.480]   The Life of the Cosmos was explicitly about that.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:49.280]   And I was very clear that what was important
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.280]   is that because you would develop an ensemble of universes,
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:59.260]   but they were related by descent through natural selection,
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:03.500]   almost every universe would share the property
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:08.500]   that it was, its fitness was maximized to some extent,
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.920]   or at least close to maximum.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.480]   And I could deduce predictions
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.080]   that could be tested from that.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.240]   And I worked all of that out,
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.440]   and I compared it to the anthropic principle
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.320]   where you weren't able to make tests
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.480]   or make falsifications.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.400]   All of this was in the late '80s and early '90s.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.000]   - That's a really compelling notion,
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.840]   but how does that help you arrive--
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:36.060]   - I'm coming to where the book came from.
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:37.000]   - Yes.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.080]   - So what got me,
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.720]   I worked on string theory.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.480]   I also worked on loop quantum gravity,
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.640]   and I was one of the inventors of loop quantum gravity.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:55.480]   And because of my strong belief in some other principles,
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.040]   which led to this notion of wanting a quantum theory
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.900]   of gravity to be what we call relational
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:03.000]   or background independent,
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.960]   I tried very hard to make string theory
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.600]   background independent,
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.840]   and ended up developing a bunch of tools
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:12.600]   which then could apply directly to general relativity,
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.040]   and that became loop quantum gravity.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.280]   So the things were very closely related,
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.440]   and have always been very closely related in my mind.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.160]   The idea that there were two communities,
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.640]   one devoted to strings and one devoted to loops,
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.720]   is nuts and has always been nuts.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.440]   - Okay, so--
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.360]   - So anyway--
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.000]   - There's this nuts community of loops and strings
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.680]   that are all beautiful and compelling
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.400]   and mathematically speaking,
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.800]   and what's the trouble with all that?
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.800]   Why is that such a problem?
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.640]   - So I was interested in developing that notion
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.400]   of how science works based on a community and ethics
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.700]   that I told you about.
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:54.780]   And I wrote a draft of a book about that,
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:58.840]   which had several chapters on methodology of science,
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:02.520]   and it was a rather academically oriented book.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:06.600]   And those chapters were the first part of the book,
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.720]   the first third of it,
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.880]   and you can find their remnants
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:14.560]   in what's now the last part of "The Trouble with Physics."
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.720]   And then I described a number of test cases, case studies,
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.220]   and one of them, which I knew,
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:22.440]   was the search for quantum gravity
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.120]   and string theory and so forth.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:28.680]   And I was unable to get that book published.
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:34.660]   So somebody made the suggestion of flipping it around
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.780]   and starting with the story of string theory,
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:38.580]   which was already controversial.
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:41.580]   This was 2004, 2005.
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:47.420]   But I was very careful to be detailed,
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:52.860]   to criticize papers and not people.
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:55.500]   You won't find me criticizing individuals,
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.060]   you'll find me criticizing certain writing.
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:04.060]   But in any case, here's what I regret.
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.500]   Let me make your program worthwhile.
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.340]   - Yes.
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:11.940]   - As far as I know, with the exception of not understanding
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:15.340]   how large the applications to condensed matter,
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:20.340]   say, of ADS-CFT would get,
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:26.020]   I think largely my diagnosis of string theory,
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:30.340]   as it was then, has stood up since 2006.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:34.940]   What I regret is that the same critique,
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.500]   I was using string theory as an example,
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:41.780]   and the same critique applies to many other communities
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:44.380]   in science and all of, including,
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:46.500]   and this is where I regret my own community,
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.860]   that is a community of people working on quantum gravity
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.220]   outside string theory.
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:55.880]   But, and I considered saying that explicitly.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.220]   But to say that explicitly,
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:00.460]   since it's a small, intimate community,
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:04.100]   I would be telling stories and naming names of,
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:08.900]   and making a kind of history that I have no right to write.
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:12.060]   So I stayed away from that, but was misunderstood.
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:16.380]   - But if I may ask, is there a hopeful message
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:20.260]   for theoretical physics that we can take from that book,
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:22.080]   sort of that looks at the community,
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.780]   not just your own work on,
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.800]   not with causality and non-locality,
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.060]   but just broadly in understanding
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:32.060]   the fundamental nature of our reality,
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:36.060]   what's your hope for the 21st century in physics
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.060]   that we can take?
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.760]   - Well, that we solve the problem.
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:44.260]   - That we solve the unfinished problem of life science.
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:46.980]   - That's certainly the thing that I care about most,
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.180]   and hope for most.
[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:50.620]   Let me say one thing.
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:53.740]   Among the young people that I work with,
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:58.740]   I hear very often and sense a total disinterest
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:03.420]   in these arguments that we older scientists have.
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:05.800]   And an interest in what each other is doing,
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.860]   and this is starting to appear in conferences
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:13.300]   where the young people interested in quantum gravity
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:16.300]   make a conference, they invite loops and strings
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:20.540]   and causal dynamical triangulations and causal set people.
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:24.060]   And we're having a conference like this next week,
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.980]   a small workshop at Perimeter,
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:28.380]   and I guess I'm advertising this,
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.460]   and then in the summer,
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:33.460]   we're having a big full-on conference,
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:34.900]   which is just quantum gravity.
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:37.260]   It's not strings, it's not loops.
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:39.420]   But the organizers and the speakers
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:41.780]   will be from all the different communities.
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:43.420]   And this to me is very helpful.
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:49.020]   - That the different ideas are coming together.
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.300]   At least people are expressing an interest in that.
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:56.300]   - It's a huge honor talking to you, Lee.
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:57.660]   Thanks so much for your time today.

[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:36.540]   God is nothing but the power of the universe
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:38.300]   to organize itself.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:42.380]   Thanks for listening, and hope to see you next time.
