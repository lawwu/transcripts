[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   - So when we think about sleep,
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.300]   some of the general rules of thumb
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.600]   that probably a lot of people have heard
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.360]   is that you're aiming for somewhere around seven to nine
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.320]   hours, but it's about so much more than that.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.320]   As human beings, we're diurnal creatures,
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.320]   meaning to be active by day and largely at rest at night.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.240]   As we deviate outside of that,
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.120]   we find that they have rates going up of things like cancer,
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.520]   heart disease, mental health issues,
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.840]   and sleep-wake disorders,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.520]   simply by just doing things at night.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.640]   I just want to know why is sleep so important?
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.840]   - One, we know that this is crucial
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.000]   for our immune function, cardiovascular health,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.680]   our emotional regulations.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.940]   Many of us don't even know what it can feel like
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.000]   or look like, wake up consistently feeling well-rested.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.440]   I truly do believe that sleep is a skill,
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.560]   all great skills, no matter if you think
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.080]   that you have this handled,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.480]   that you can venture into mastery
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.400]   and that there is always this opportunity
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.600]   for us to improve upon this area.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.720]   And even then, when you might think you have it handled,
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.960]   something happens.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.560]   - Molly, thank you so much for being here.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.240]   - Oh, thank you so much for having me.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.080]   - I'm so excited.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.680]   Sleep is so fundamental
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.840]   and it's such an important part of our lives.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.320]   I think I constantly talk to people
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.880]   who aren't giving it as much attention as it deserves.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.600]   And I just want to know why is sleep so important?
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.600]   - Okay, so we really struggle to find a single domain
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.880]   of life that is not negatively impacted
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.840]   when our sleep is not working as well as it could.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.200]   And what does that mean?
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.800]   So when you think about different domains of life,
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.600]   when you think about cognition,
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.440]   when you think about cardiovascular health,
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.800]   when you think about immune health,
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.240]   when you think about emotional regulation,
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.560]   mental health, et cetera,
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.560]   the ripple effects are so vast
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.620]   from a negative side of things
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.760]   when we're not getting the sleep that we require,
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.800]   whether in duration, regularity, the quality of that sleep.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.960]   But then on the flip side,
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.560]   from a more potentially positive spin,
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.340]   we struggle to find areas of life
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.320]   that are not positively impacted from a ripple effect
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.200]   when we do improve this area of our life.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.800]   So it really has the possibility
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.440]   to absolutely reach in, have its tentacles
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.720]   into your whole experience of your life.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.880]   And that's one of the reasons I'm so passionate about it.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.560]   - All right, so I think maybe to set a baseline,
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.440]   'cause I'm sure we're gonna talk
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.360]   about lots of parts of sleep.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.960]   Let's talk about like fundamentals.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.400]   What are the different stages?
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.600]   What's important about them?
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.480]   Let's kind of set some understanding
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.120]   of sleep in general for people.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.400]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.040]   So when we think about sleep,
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.720]   some of the general rules of thumb
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.020]   that probably a lot of people have heard
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.720]   is that for a healthy adult,
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.740]   you're aiming for somewhere around seven to nine hours.
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.920]   So that would be in the duration category.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.080]   And that's what a lot of people are thinking about.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.560]   So how much sleep am I logging?
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.080]   But it's about so much more than that.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.160]   So you can be someone that hits whatever,
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.780]   seven and a half hours every single night,
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.000]   but it might be all over the place as far as regularity.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.640]   It might be fragmented.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.920]   So you might be taking a very long time
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.400]   to log that seven and a half hours.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.120]   So that can be problematic.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.080]   So we wanna get more granular
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.600]   on what our kind of goals are with our sleep.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.680]   Also knowing that each individual
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.960]   is gonna have some bio-individuality
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.840]   on how much sleep they should be getting.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.160]   But there are certain components
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.680]   that we would like to have as far as consistency,
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.800]   regularity, less of that sleep fragmentation, et cetera.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.160]   When we think about sleep stage classifications.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.560]   Now, this is where a lot of people
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.920]   start to go a little funky,
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.800]   meaning that I have a lot of people coming my way
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.280]   and they're freaking out
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.080]   because they're tracking on Aura, Whoop,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.680]   Apple, Garmin, et cetera.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.240]   And they're saying, I'm not getting any deep sleep.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.760]   I'm not getting any REM, et cetera.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.600]   So first off, when we think about those sleep stages,
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.040]   we can from a, if you're tracking,
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.080]   'cause usually the application nowadays
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.480]   is that we're tracking with some sort of element
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.280]   of a sleep tracker.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.600]   And so we're getting this information out
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.040]   and yet we're wondering, am I getting enough?
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.560]   Is this okay?
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.840]   And the problem is,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.840]   is that this is the least accurate data on our wearables.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.120]   So all the information that's coming out,
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.240]   this is the least accurate.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.480]   It's using its own algorithm within each wearable
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.080]   to make its best guess on, are you in deep sleep?
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.000]   Are you in REM?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.080]   Are you in light sleep?
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.280]   It's kind of how it's been boiled down
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.240]   to some of the generalized ways
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.800]   that we're thinking of our sleep.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   And the problem is, is that because it's that best guess,
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.200]   if the algorithm is changed,
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.160]   your results with your sleep staging
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.480]   is going to be markedly shifted.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.680]   So I work primarily with Oura Ring
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.200]   from a consumer grade tracker perspective.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.680]   And just this year, well, just in 2023,
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.360]   a big algorithm change
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.920]   and there was entirely different results
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.560]   for many, many people on their deep sleep,
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.320]   their REM, et cetera.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.680]   And if you were making decisions
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.760]   on those numbers beforehand,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.560]   you were really kind of taken for a surprise
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.520]   when you got these totally new set of numbers.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.200]   So my big message for people, if they are tracking,
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   is one, to not get too crazed about the REM deep sleep
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.080]   and your light sleep.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.520]   Instead, you can look from a trends perspective,
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.920]   do not try to cross reference within wearables
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.560]   since they are using such different algorithms,
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.400]   but within each wearable,
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.720]   you can start to notice particular trends
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.200]   and see are there patterns that you can help support
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.480]   based on those trends.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.760]   And now, if we pan out even further,
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.160]   some of the generalized things
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.200]   that I think have a practical application
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.480]   is just simply to know that on your first half of the night,
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.800]   what most of us are looking for is a deeper,
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.480]   a more kind of higher ratio of deep sleep on the first half
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.600]   and a higher ratio of REM on the second half.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.240]   And what is important about that
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.320]   is even from a timing perspective,
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.160]   which I think a lot of people don't realize,
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160]   is that if you manipulate the time
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.880]   by which you're going to sleep
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.080]   and say you just decide to go to bed later
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.640]   on your Fridays, Saturdays,
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.920]   and maybe even into Sundays or what have you,
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.280]   then you're lobbing off some of your possibility
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.520]   and potential to get deep sleep,
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.320]   that's that first part of your sleep,
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.720]   'cause the body likes to try to stay on time.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.840]   So you're hitting some of your potential
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.840]   to get deep sleep on the first half.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.560]   And then on the flip side,
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.640]   if you're someone that's waking up earlier
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.800]   on certain parts of your week or what have you,
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.960]   then you're cutting into some of your potential
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.480]   to get that REM.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.280]   And probably most people have heard
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.480]   of some of the importance of both of these.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.760]   Deep sleep, really, really crucial
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.320]   for some of our brain health,
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.600]   our reparative mechanisms, growth hormone, and more.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.320]   And then of course, for REM,
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.600]   you can almost think of it as like your inner therapist.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.720]   So, so much from our cognition, our memory,
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.960]   our emotional regulation, fortitude, other things
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.600]   can all get impacted then
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.000]   if you are cutting into your morning timing.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   So this is what's so interesting about sleep
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.120]   is that there's a real strategy
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.200]   by which we can navigate, what are we prioritizing?
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.200]   And the least sexy thing about all this
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.560]   is one of the best ways to prioritize this
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.400]   and help facilitate it is consistency,
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.800]   which virtually no one wants to hear.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.520]   But it's one of the most powerful things
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.520]   that can make such a difference with those ratios.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.400]   - For someone who's not tracking with a device,
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.080]   is there a way to kind of estimate
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.760]   how your quality of your sleep is or what you're getting?
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.400]   Is it about how you feel in the morning
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.000]   or how many times you wake up or something like that?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.200]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.520]   So historically, 'cause of course I know
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.200]   I'm mentioning a lot of wearables and trackers,
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.840]   so for anyone listening that's like, "I'm not tracking,"
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.840]   or has no interest in tracking or maybe was tracking,
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.440]   I see this a lot, and then they're just over it.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.280]   They're like, "Well, I got what I needed to get,"
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.120]   or what have you.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.560]   If you're not tracking, for many, many years,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.120]   if you were struggling with your sleep,
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.200]   you wanted to get a sense of like, "How am I sleeping?"
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.320]   People would do, take a kind of sleep diary or sleep log.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.720]   And so that's something you can do in a low-tech way,
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.160]   just pen and paper, and you can start kind of tracking
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.360]   for a period of time.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.360]   What time are you going to sleep?
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.640]   So you're getting into bed,
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.400]   and how long is it about taking you to fall asleep?
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.920]   Then from that point, what time are you waking up?
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.600]   But in between that time, there's often for many people,
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.960]   a lot that might go on.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.280]   So they might wake up at three, four in the morning,
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.240]   and if so, how long are you waking up?
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.320]   If you're really struggling with,
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.200]   it can be referred to as insomnia,
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   kind of difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep,
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.240]   what are some of the thoughts that are coming up
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.280]   throughout that period of time,
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.920]   so that we can just get kind of a read
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.040]   on both your results with your sleep,
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.040]   but also your relationship to your sleep.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.560]   Are you getting really thrown by some of these results?
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.680]   But then, of course, to your point,
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.080]   so once we're tracking for a period of time,
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.320]   it's like, what other information can we glean?
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.120]   Well, we can glean, what is our average bedtime?
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.880]   What is our average wake-up time?
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.360]   What are average number of kind of sleep fragmentations
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.920]   or wake-ups throughout the course of the night?
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.120]   How long are we awake during that period?
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.440]   But then also, of course, the subjectivity,
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.880]   because even if you are tracking or aren't tracking,
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.520]   what's your subjective experience?
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.600]   'Cause we're not just robots,
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.000]   it's not just results-oriented, like, how do we feel?
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.640]   So are you waking up really feeling very fatigued?
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.800]   Now, there is something known as sleep inertia
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.280]   in the morning, where you might have that kind of just,
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.400]   you're coming back to life, back online, if you will,
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.740]   'cause you've been in this altered state for hours,
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.840]   and now you're coming back, you know,
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.200]   kind of at a different level of cognition,
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.060]   so you might have a little bit of a sleepy haze to you.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.620]   That's often normal, but is it really augmented
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.420]   or really a struggle for you to wake up,
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.260]   go about your day-to-day activities?
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.840]   Are you finding that then you're consistently sleepy
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.980]   throughout the course of the day?
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.740]   This can then get into questions of even
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.100]   beyond just sleep deprivation or poor sleep,
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.820]   then possible sleep disorders,
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.860]   which Mount Sinai just quantified it as,
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.940]   that it appears that there's over 100 sleep disorders
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.180]   or sleep-wake disorders.
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.620]   So there are a lot of things that could be undiagnosed
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.960]   that you wanna be aware of, too.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.860]   Could you be dealing with that level of fatigue
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.260]   throughout the course of your day
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.380]   that could point to things like
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.380]   respiratory-based sleep disorders, like sleep apnea,
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.760]   upper airway resistance syndrome, or otherwise,
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.880]   and those can really impact the quality of your sleep.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.860]   So are there, like, red flags present?
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.540]   Another big red flag that I see a lot for people
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.540]   in relation to your point around, like,
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.440]   what else might we be able to tell if we're not tracking,
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.300]   is are you falling asleep
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.020]   the minute your head hits the pillow?
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.380]   And I get this all the time.
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.660]   People are like, "Oh, yeah, I'm sleep.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.500]   "I'm good with that.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.800]   "I can sleep anytime, anywhere, doesn't matter.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.660]   "I am out.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.020]   "I don't have any problems with that."
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.100]   But actually, that would be a red flag for us
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.780]   that something might be a problem
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.980]   because that can denote or be a sign of sleep deprivation
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.060]   or an undiagnosed sleep disorder
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.820]   because we do want a little bit of a sleep latency
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.640]   period of time, so a kind of healthy sleep latency,
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.940]   if you will, and it will be bio-individual,
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.840]   but somewhere in the 10 to 15-minute range,
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.940]   quite usually, is kind of a healthy amount of time
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.820]   to go from an awake state, down-regulate,
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.900]   into this totally different sleep state.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.460]   So if you're seeing that for yourself,
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.900]   you're falling asleep really immediately.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.060]   If you're then having a lot of those sleep fragmentations,
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.600]   if you're waking up really tired,
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.540]   also, in the realm of sleep disorders,
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.660]   are you waking up with dry mouth?
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.420]   Are you waking up with headaches?
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.940]   Things that might point to some of the things
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.060]   that you were doing throughout the course of the night.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.600]   Sleep, teeth grinding, bruxism,
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.540]   some of these sleep disorders that can really impact
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.900]   some of your sleep quality.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.020]   So there's a lot to navigate.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.220]   - Where do sleep cycles play in here?
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.940]   I feel like there was a time in my life
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.340]   where it was like, wow, do you need periods of 90 minutes?
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.060]   And I'm like, is this a thing?
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.740]   Is that something we should discuss in advance?
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.380]   - Yeah, so I get a lot of people that will come my way,
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.260]   and they'll be strategizing about the sleep cycles.
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.620]   And it is very interesting, because it's very true.
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.900]   We will be navigating through these sleep cycles,
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.460]   and a little different for each person.
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.500]   So it could be around these 90-minute timeframes,
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.700]   is the popular amount of time
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.460]   that seems to be a kind of an average,
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.740]   but it might be plus or minus for each individual.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.540]   And the aim is to get through some of these sleep cycles,
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.580]   a number of these sleep cycles
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.940]   throughout the course of the night, of course.
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.680]   And yet, I find that a lot of people are fixating
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.700]   on some of the sleep cycles and strategies around that,
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.780]   and missing some of the force for the trees
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.500]   on some of these other things that we can absolutely do
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.220]   to let those, the automaticity of that
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.900]   kind of come together on its own.
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.500]   If we have these egregious sleep disorders
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.140]   that we're missing, that of course is gonna impact
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.220]   the workability of those sleep cycles,
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.820]   of how you're oscillating through those
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.100]   throughout the course of the night.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.420]   But even beyond that, one of the things
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.940]   that I'm often seeing just on the ground
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.260]   is so many things that people are behaving,
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.020]   the behaviors that they're engaging in,
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.340]   environmental elements, et cetera,
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.220]   that are impacting their ability
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.420]   to navigate some of those sleep cycles effectively.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.140]   And then I guess the last piece about the sleep cycles
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.420]   would be a number of people talk about
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.460]   wanting to have, be woken up in kind of that ideal part
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.780]   of their sleep cycle.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.700]   And I think there's kind of merit to that.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.900]   And one of the things that I find is the more
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.780]   we kind of bring in some of these workable elements
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.420]   with our sleep, we really get dialed in
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.860]   on some of these components,
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.420]   that often it kind of just falls into place
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.180]   on its own quite frequently,
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.860]   so that you don't have to have the intervention
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.100]   of technology.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.420]   If people aren't familiar with this,
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.700]   some people are looking to find pieces of tech
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.860]   that can wake them up at certain parts
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.740]   of their sleep cycle is the aim.
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.140]   And you can absolutely experiment with things like that.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.740]   But I would also point to getting us aware
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.460]   of how many things that we can do while we're awake
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.860]   that can facilitate that those all work effectively.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.020]   - And before we go too much further,
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.980]   why is sleep so important?
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.100]   Can we talk for a moment about what's going on in the body,
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.260]   why we need it, why it's so valuable?
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.660]   - Human beings for centuries and centuries,
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.900]   it is the one area of life that we have not been able
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.540]   to hack our way out of.
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.340]   I know this is a podcast around all the hacks,
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.820]   and yet we have not been able to figure out a way
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.940]   to cut out this very vulnerable part of our day
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.980]   when we are just asleep for a stretch of time
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.100]   for seven to nine hours for most people.
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.620]   So why do we keep doing that?
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.140]   Why is that so important?
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.980]   Well, one, we know that this is crucial
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.020]   for our immune function, cardiovascular health,
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.020]   for our emotional regulation.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.500]   We know that it's also just so important for our waistline,
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:38.500]   for our whole experience of life is going to be colored
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.540]   if we don't prioritize this area.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.100]   And yet many of us don't even know what it can feel like
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:49.100]   or look like to wake up consistently feeling well-rested
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.940]   and what that can kind of the crossover effects
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.060]   of what that can look like.
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.940]   - I'm excited to dig into all of these things.
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.220]   I have a couple of random questions when it comes to sleep.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:04.220]   One is, how different is this on individual basis?
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.180]   And I ask this because we've talked about seven to nine
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.740]   hours and I have this one friend who can sleep almost
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.380]   nothing all the time and then sleep for like 13 hours
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.220]   on the weekend.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.780]   And I'm like, are there just some people wired differently
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.300]   that need different amounts of sleep
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.700]   that can catch up differently?
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.220]   Or like, is my friend just burning himself out?
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.060]   - It's a great question.
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.060]   I get that one a lot.
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:30.060]   So first off, it appears that we can have these particular
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.380]   coping mechanisms.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.180]   So your friend is a person that I see a lot
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.240]   where they come in, we look at their stats
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.260]   and they might have four hours, five hours, six hours,
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.340]   then 13 hours.
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.820]   And the problem with that is that that can kind of save
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.420]   the day for a while and stretch of time,
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.980]   but eventually we'll see hits on a number of areas
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:53.820]   across the board.
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.140]   So for men, we know that testosterone levels
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.060]   are massively hit when we do that on a stretch of time.
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:06.060]   And even as we had an expert, Dr. Alison Brager,
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.540]   who'd come on as a representative of the U.S. Army
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.180]   that found that there's a point of no return
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.940]   after doing this for multiple, multiple times
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.140]   because you're not able to bring about that hormone
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.740]   stability after this long, long stretch
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:21.580]   of doing these things.
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.660]   That's like one example, right?
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.280]   But for the most people, what we find is that
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.660]   there's a reason we have sort of this U-shaped curve
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.460]   of the suggestion for length of time
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.580]   that we suggest for people to sleep
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.260]   because we see impacts of all-cause mortality rates
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.780]   really going up when you're getting much below
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.260]   six hours of sleep, but it also goes on the other side
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.660]   when you're getting too much sleep consistently.
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.420]   So that's concerning as well.
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.880]   So they're kind of getting hit at both sides of this.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.980]   So we're getting the insufficient sleep
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.020]   for stretches of time, and then we're just logging
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.340]   these really long periods.
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.660]   So this is problematic for both sleep duration.
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.100]   We know that that's not getting you the quality of sleep
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.980]   that we want to get.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.980]   Also from that bio-individual perspective
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:09.980]   that you asked about.
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.760]   Besides, so we know that most people,
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.680]   it's like incredibly small percentage
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.320]   that might have this very strange, small, you know,
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.900]   kind of chance that they're short sleepers,
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.300]   but it's almost negligible, the percentage rate.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.740]   So most people need to still fall into this realm
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.540]   of this seven to nine hours.
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.020]   However, it goes a little bit less as we age,
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.940]   this is why sleep is dynamic.
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.500]   So as we get a little bit older,
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.900]   we do find that people might go closer to say
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.020]   that six to seven hours might still be a range
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.760]   that kind of appears and still be within a healthy domain.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.300]   But aside from that, when people start saying,
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.200]   I'm fine, this is workable for me,
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.140]   when we bring about more stability and consistency
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.940]   with their sleep, I can almost guarantee
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.880]   that what we see both on the ground and then in studies
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.100]   is that there's a change in the quality of that sleep
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.860]   for the better, and that will ripple into other metrics.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.500]   So things like the improvements in often blood pressure,
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.500]   their cardiovascular health, if we're looking at heart rate,
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.520]   HRV, heart rate variability, and otherwise.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.940]   If we're talking about women, this could impact things
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.340]   like their cycle workability and others.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.920]   - I have so many questions and I wanna go into optimizing
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.380]   and all this, but how important is it
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.620]   that this quantity of sleep happens at one point in time?
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.620]   And it's interesting 'cause we have two young kids
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.180]   and I'm like, oh, well, they get sleep at night and naps.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.100]   And I remember some point in my life reading
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.540]   about this crazy concept of like extreme polyphasic sleep
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.980]   where you could sleep for 20 minutes,
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.940]   like six or eight times a day, and that would be fine.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.180]   We don't have to go that far down that rabbit hole,
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.540]   but do you need to sleep all at once
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.160]   or can you break it up throughout the day?
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.000]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.920]   And so people often will reference some of these findings
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:13.020]   that in centuries past, it appeared that we might've had
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:17.460]   kind of two parts to our sleep was one popular way
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.940]   of looking at sleep, and this kind of brings a sigh
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.020]   of relief for some people that are waking up
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.740]   throughout the course of the night, like, oh, okay,
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.980]   maybe this is just one part of my sleep
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.900]   and now I have a little period of being awake
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.840]   in a second part.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.540]   And then there's also the group that you're speaking to
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.420]   of the multiple naps throughout the course of the day.
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.700]   Now, what we find and how do we think about this?
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.980]   Well, we can also look at modern day hunter-gatherer tribes.
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.100]   So we can look at tribes like the Hudson tribe
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.420]   has been looked at from a sleep perspective.
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.860]   And we don't find that to be indicative
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.580]   of how they're conducting themselves as one example,
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.500]   but also how we like to think about maximizing
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.380]   and optimizing for sleep today.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:04.380]   It now has been drilled into that longer stretch of sleep.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.500]   It's very healthy.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.540]   It's still okay to have some wake-ups
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.380]   'cause I know some people can get really concerned
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.900]   and nervous about stretches of time
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.980]   where they will have some wake-ups.
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.580]   The difference is we're trying to understand
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.740]   how long are those wake-ups?
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.940]   What is your response from a psychological perspective
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.180]   during that?
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.220]   And then of course, parents during a stretch of times
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.860]   when we are, whether we choose to or not,
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.420]   being awakened throughout the course of the night
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.460]   and understanding, can we make up for that?
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.300]   Well, one thing that we see is that largely
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:43.060]   we like to have this very clear diurnal system.
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.060]   So meaning that as human beings, we're diurnal creatures,
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:50.440]   meaning to be active by day and largely at rest at night.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.440]   And what we find is that as we deviate outside of that,
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.440]   shift workers being an example of that,
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.400]   they're being more active, nothing different
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.220]   beyond just being more active at night.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.480]   And we find that they have rates going up
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:08.440]   of things like cancer, heart disease, mental health issues,
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.400]   and sleep-wake disorders simply
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.580]   by just doing things at night.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.200]   So it points to how important it is to maintain this.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.900]   So when we start juggling all of these things
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.680]   and we're sleeping for long stretches
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.080]   throughout the course of our night,
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.640]   we know that often from a circadian perspective,
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.640]   which is one of the areas I'm particularly interested in,
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.960]   is that that seems to spill
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.440]   into some of your results with your sleep.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.940]   So the big takeaway here is how can we sleep
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.120]   as much of the portion of our evenings
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.880]   and if you are needing to supplement that,
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.200]   which sometimes can happen, of course,
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.800]   as parents or we're traveling or we're sick
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.680]   or something is coming up,
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.240]   then you can supplement to a certain extent with naps
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.200]   unless you're dealing with insomnia.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.840]   Insomnia can be a time where you might wanna abstain
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.800]   from naps or be a bit more thoughtful about naps
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.240]   because you might be struggling with that ability
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.180]   to really clearly turn on and off
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.700]   that wake drive versus sleep drive.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.960]   So by heightening your sleep drive,
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.360]   by not engaging in too many naps by day,
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.760]   that can be beneficial for someone dealing with insomnia.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.960]   But for the rest of us,
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.600]   if you're just looking to make up for some of that sleep,
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.920]   those naps can make sense,
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.820]   but we're looking to usually keep them
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.760]   somewhere in the domain of around,
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.000]   often the power nap area, so like the 20 to 25 minutes,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.480]   but usually no longer than a sleep cycle,
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.440]   like you pointed to, so around that 90 minutes.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.900]   - Okay, but you can rejuvenate in a nap.
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.520]   So if you're someone who just, for whatever reason,
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.560]   isn't able to get a full night's sleep,
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.160]   is there an optimal time of day for that nap?
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.320]   - Yes, totally, great question.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.260]   So earlier on in the day is what we're liking
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:59.680]   to position the timing for those naps.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.100]   So for most people, that would look like
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.800]   somewhere around before 3 p.m. or so.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.880]   Of course, if you have a different sleep-wake schedule,
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.120]   adjust that accordingly.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.740]   But kind of in your early afternoon,
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.800]   so that you're not tapping into
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.640]   some of those adenosine reserves,
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.280]   that kind of sleepiness chemical, if you will,
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.840]   that's building up throughout the whole course of the day.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.200]   You can think of this as when you're first waking up,
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.560]   you have some of the least reserves of this adenosine,
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.000]   this kind of sleepiness component,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.640]   and then it's accumulating
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.540]   throughout the whole rest of the day.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.380]   And we want it to be just toppling over,
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.520]   like at the brim when you get to sleep.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.960]   But there's a couple things
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.520]   that can impact the adenosine load.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.800]   One of them can be naps.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.580]   So that could kind of dump out
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:47.080]   some of your reserves of adenosine for the day.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.000]   The another one, very common one,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.200]   can be things like caffeine.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.560]   And so that can make you,
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.580]   it won't dump it out in the same way,
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.220]   but it will make your brain think
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.640]   that it's kind of not present,
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.840]   like trick you into thinking that the adenosine,
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.240]   that sleepiness component, isn't building up.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.160]   So these are ways that you can both have it all.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.240]   So it's how to be refreshed, get kind of that second wind.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.400]   So leverage those naps in the day
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.340]   if you're not dealing with insomnia.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.720]   Have that, and that can also spill into things
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.880]   like someone like Andrew Huberman is kind of popularizing
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.760]   this non-sleep deep rest protocols.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.600]   So kind of this trance-like state, if you will,
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.680]   where you're, whether it's yoga nidra,
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.720]   kind of a hypnosis-like state.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.360]   So you might not even be fully asleep,
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.800]   but still your body is getting some of the benefits
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.120]   of being in that restorative state.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.320]   So that can be another way to kind of recoup
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.760]   a little bit of energy throughout the course of the day.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.500]   - And so I watched that video, the Huberman thing,
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.200]   and I was like, oh, 'cause I wanted to ask this question
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.360]   about whether there's a way to get some of the benefits
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.920]   of sleep while not sleeping.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.880]   But if what you're doing is, you know,
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.080]   kind of lying down and doing breathing exercises,
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.860]   like I felt like, oh, might as well be sleeping.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.560]   Like maybe if you can't sleep, but are there any, you know,
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.920]   if you were lying down, relaxing, listening to music
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.040]   or reading a book or doing anything a little bit more active
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.160]   than just meditating, for example,
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.360]   or kind of breathing exercises,
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.840]   can you get any of that benefit
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.600]   or does it really need to be sleep?
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.800]   - So this is a huge one I find that can be really helpful
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.760]   for people that are dealing with sleep anxiety.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.080]   So sleep anxiety can kind of go in the domain,
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.240]   this is something that I dealt with
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.800]   when I was going through my sleep kind of breakdown
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.480]   years back was this fixation on sleep
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.360]   and then this feeling that, oh, okay,
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.280]   so if I'm not getting my sleep
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.120]   throughout the course of the night, I'm just screwed.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.220]   You know, like I'm just not getting these results,
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.440]   but it turns out that one thing we can kind of keep
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.920]   in the back of our mind is that there is still some benefit
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.960]   from being in kind of a restorative state,
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.640]   even just in a, you know, laying supine position,
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.600]   your heart rate's coming down,
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.600]   closing your eyes can also help change
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.720]   some of your brain activity
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.480]   and allows for some of this restorative processes
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.560]   to happen of the body.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.120]   Now, is it the same as sleep?
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.240]   Not quite, but it still can give you a little bit
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.240]   of a respite in knowing that you're doing something generous
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.260]   for the body.
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.160]   Now this can apply both in the middle of the night
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.360]   if you're struggling to sleep,
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.280]   just knowing that you're still getting some restoration
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.480]   by being in kind of that peaceful, relaxed state,
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.080]   bringing the heart rate down.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.160]   So the body can still go to work on some of that repair,
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.280]   and yet that applies during the course of the day as well.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.440]   Now I see this really in a cool way gamified
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.640]   with wearables lately.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.640]   Two that are doing this well, I think,
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.680]   is both Whoop and Oura Ring.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.400]   So they're actually showing you your daytime stress load
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.600]   and then almost helping to reward, if you will,
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.960]   stretches of time when you're getting a little bit
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.640]   of restoration.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.280]   So it will see, it will show you clearly
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.280]   and kind of give you a rundown or a quota
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.760]   for how much of that restorative time you're getting
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.120]   throughout the course of the day.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.720]   And so it can kind of help to gamify this protocol,
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.840]   if you will, instead of just like a nice to have.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.400]   Now suddenly you're offsetting high amounts of stress
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.600]   throughout the course of the day
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.440]   with a little breather kind of recovery time.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.560]   - When we think about optimizing sleep,
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.440]   who benefits from optimizing sleep?
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.480]   Is this something for everyone?
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.320]   Are there some people who kind of maybe you have it good
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.280]   already or what things should people be asking themselves
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.000]   before they want to decide if this is a journey
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.840]   they want to go down?
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:38.680]   - Absolutely.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.280]   Well, first off, I would like to offer for people
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.920]   that I truly do believe that sleep is a skill
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.520]   and like all great skills, no matter if you think
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.840]   and you have it, that you have this handled,
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.520]   that you can venture into mastery
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.920]   and that there is always this opportunity for us
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.160]   to improve upon this area.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.280]   And even then, when you might think you have it handled,
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.680]   something happens, you get divorced,
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.560]   you have a death in the families
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.560]   and we'll find it bleed into your sleep results.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.480]   So I would offer for everyone to explore
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.800]   taking this area of life on as the foundation
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.240]   by which you are really setting up your wellness journey
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:23.240]   before nutrition, exercise, mental health strategies,
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.760]   of course, those are all so important
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.240]   and they're bidirectional, but we want to,
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.400]   I would offer that there could be some benefits
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.800]   by taking on a lens of prioritizing your sleep first
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.280]   and that will aid in your ability to fulfill
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.160]   on all those other things, get yourself to the gym,
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.280]   make the smart decisions when you're standing
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.760]   in front of the cupboard or what have you.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.480]   So from that place, what are some indications
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.120]   of that you might be struggling with your sleep
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.480]   and that you might wanna really take this area on?
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.680]   Well, one can be, we've talked a lot about sleep duration
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.080]   and some of the numbers you might be logging
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.400]   and you might say, I'm getting all those,
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.720]   but I still feel tired, sluggish,
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.400]   not at my best throughout the course of the day.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.560]   That could be a sign for us to look at some of the sleep
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:11.400]   that you're logging, is it as rich as it could be?
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.880]   Are you having a lot of labels around your sleep?
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.320]   I certainly used to say this, a bunch of labels for myself,
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.000]   I would say things like, I'm a short sleeper,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   I'm a bad sleeper, I'm a night owl, it's in my genes,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.720]   I'll sleep when I'm dead, so it goes into narratives.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.680]   So you might have certain ways
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.080]   by which you're relating to your sleep,
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.880]   like it's just fixed and that's how it's gonna be
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.600]   versus that we would just have a set of results right now
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.720]   and that there's an opportunity
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:40.160]   for more of a growth perspective to improve upon this.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.800]   If you're tracking, your sleep efficiency numbers
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.320]   might not be as high as we would like them to be.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.600]   Now, we don't want them to be too high
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.320]   because then that can mean you're falling asleep
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.800]   right as the minute your head hits the pillow.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:56.240]   But often in kind of this high 80s, low 90s range
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.720]   might be an area that we might wanna look to
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.560]   optimizing for, I don't want people to stress out
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.480]   if they're not quite there,
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.440]   but it just could be an area of an opportunity.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.360]   If you're relying on a lot of things to improve your sleep,
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.880]   so if you have a lot of supplements,
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.360]   this whole particular stack that you need
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:18.160]   in just in order to kind of fall asleep or stay asleep,
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.320]   that could be indicative of the fact
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.880]   that now we're kind of bringing about,
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.520]   we have these external things
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.840]   that we now require to get great sleep.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.440]   And that's not to say that we won't do
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.240]   all kinds of cool things with optimizing your environment
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.440]   and bringing you all kinds of things to improve your sleep
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.760]   from an environmental and setting you up powerfully.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:41.760]   But if you feel like you yourself cannot get great sleep,
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.920]   that can be a sign for us.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.920]   And then also if you have the sense
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.200]   that you used to sleep great and then something happened,
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:54.560]   I had kids, which understandably there may a stretch of time
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.480]   where your sleep absolutely will be disrupted.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.520]   So I don't wanna stress anyone else with that.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.720]   But we see there can be these narratives that get developed
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.720]   and then we start to lower the bar
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.960]   on what's possible for us,
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.040]   where we might be able to actually make a big difference
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.280]   with some of these results.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.440]   So that can be important,
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.640]   but also just getting curious
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.360]   about different stages of life.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.680]   Your sleep is gonna look very different
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:24.360]   from teenage years to 20s, to 30s, 40s, 50s beyond.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.120]   And we want to keep checking in and testing,
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.360]   seeing are there hormonal changes at play?
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.640]   Is there environment?
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.880]   Did you move into a new house
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.880]   and now you're not getting the same level of sleep?
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.120]   Is there something going on in that space?
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.040]   Et cetera, et cetera.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.440]   So there's a lot of signs and those are some.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.720]   - I know you have a whole list of 10 on the website.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.440]   We'll link to that in the show notes.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.160]   I want to talk about these environmental things.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.480]   So we're gonna talk,
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.600]   I think for the rest of this conversation,
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.440]   let's talk a little bit about the environment,
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.560]   the different things that could be affecting sleep
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.080]   and we could talk about how to change them
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.800]   and kind of things you need to focus on.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.240]   We'll talk a little bit about technology.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.600]   And I know you have some data for my sleep
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.000]   that might be fun to also kind of run through.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.680]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.840]   - So what are kind of the factors?
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.960]   Let's start with the environment and routine stuff.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.160]   - Okay.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.200]   So first I would like for people to think about the fact
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.720]   that our circadian rhythm becomes paramount in this.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.920]   What is your circadian rhythm?
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.400]   It's around this 24 hour rhythm that as human beings,
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.800]   we're all operating within.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.440]   I mentioned that we're diurnal creatures.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.880]   So of those 24 hours, half of the day,
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.560]   we want to be ideally prioritizing getting,
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.280]   being out in the light movement activity.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.840]   You're doing things when the light is out,
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.680]   but then when the sun sets and when darkness comes,
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.040]   we want to be prioritizing sort of a day mode
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.800]   versus night mode.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.520]   And when that night mode comes about,
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.320]   we want to really shift our environment accordingly.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.160]   Why?
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.280]   Because there's something known as zeitgeibers
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.720]   or time givers.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.080]   And these are just, you know,
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.680]   kind of sayings of what are some of the things
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.880]   that massively impact our circadian health.
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.960]   And the most important,
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.520]   if you get nothing else out of what I'm saying,
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.800]   I know we're talking about a lot of things,
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.960]   but if you get nothing else out of what I'm saying,
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.480]   it's minding your light dark cycles
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.280]   is our most paramount to strengthening our circadian rhythm.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.520]   You know, I go to these like sleep conferences
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.440]   and believe it or not, they're sleep conferences.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:24.160]   And some of the biggest takeaways can be boiling down
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:28.000]   to having ultra bright days and dark nights.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.280]   And that can sound so simplistic,
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.600]   but most of us are not doing this
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.720]   to the point that there was just this year,
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:39.400]   a call from a scientific consensus of focusing
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.320]   and pulling from almost 250 circadian scientists
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:48.320]   referencing almost 2,700 peer reviewed scientific papers
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.680]   pointing to the need to add warning labels on light bulbs
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.440]   when used at night.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.080]   So why?
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.120]   Because they found that the use of simply
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.440]   just boring old light bulbs that we're using
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.280]   on a routine basis are increasing rates of cancer,
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.480]   diabetes, heart disease, mental health issues,
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.760]   as well as of course our sleep awake challenges
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.280]   that we might be seeing.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.240]   So something so simple as swapping out our light bulbs
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.520]   to go from our traditional LEDs,
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.640]   which now 'cause incandescence became illegal this year,
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.440]   so which were more closely aligned
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.680]   with the rhythms of nature.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.720]   Those are now illegal, you can't purchase those.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.120]   So now you're left with fluorescents and LEDs.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.880]   So of those, they tend to be very blue rich
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.320]   and blue is gonna disrupt your melatonin production
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.760]   to levels that most people don't realize the impact.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.400]   So at the bare minimum,
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.080]   you're changing your light bulbs in your environment
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.700]   to mimic the rhythms of nature.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.280]   So one thing that we used to be around was fire
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.240]   and fire was kind of that first biohack
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.320]   and that was very red rich.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.760]   So we want our light bulbs to be more
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.760]   of that red amber color or candle lights,
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.760]   Himalayan salt lamps, any of this very dim lighting.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.000]   So you wanna first start there, but it doesn't end there.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.840]   You have to in the mornings to help inoculate yourself
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.840]   from any of those negative impacts
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.880]   of even any of this foe light.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.840]   You really need to get that bright light exposure by day
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.440]   and much more than you're gonna be getting indoors.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.280]   Why?
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.920]   'Cause the average indoor environment
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.760]   is usually somewhere below about a thousand lux.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.640]   Whereas if you go outside in summer day,
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.960]   it can be up to a hundred thousand lux.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.000]   So that is a huge difference
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.200]   and we do not understand what that's doing
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.600]   to our health and wellbeing, particularly our sleep.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.680]   So beginning there, then the second piece
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.500]   would be going into things like temperature timing,
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.440]   meal timing, exercise timing,
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.280]   thought timing and drug timing.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.440]   So all of this timing phenomenon
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.040]   of where you're putting things in your day
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.600]   will impact your circadian strength
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:03.600]   and by effect your sleep-wake kind of signaling.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.200]   - Okay, so let's run through these.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.280]   So for light, the takeaway is get rid of the blue lights
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.420]   in your kind of room and maybe replace them
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.480]   with brighter, warmer lights.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.460]   - Yeah, and just make sure that it's not just says,
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.920]   'cause some of them will say like, oh, warm tone LEDs.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.360]   But traditionally what we often see
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.760]   is that those are still insufficient.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.760]   They're still have blue in many of them.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.560]   So just making sure they should really look
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.080]   pretty amber hued or red.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.960]   And now more of them will actually point
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.980]   to that they've been tested
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:38.400]   so that they'll still be sleep friendly.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.760]   So those are some things
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.760]   that I would make sure you're having.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.640]   - And then I assume if once you're up,
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.620]   open all the windows.
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.460]   If you're not getting outside right away,
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.000]   at least open up the windows, but even better, go outside.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   - Even better, go outside.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.440]   Because there are studies that show
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.120]   that it can take anywhere from 50 to a hundred times longer
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.920]   to reset your master clock
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.840]   when getting light from behind windows.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.000]   Like if we're watching the video,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.160]   I've got all these windows behind me.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.240]   This is, even though I've got so much light coming in here,
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.720]   it's still insufficient to reset my master clock
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.240]   in the morning if I was just to rest on my laurels
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.320]   and only get light from behind here.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.200]   So you really need to go outside.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.040]   Why?
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.600]   Because the light is gonna hit your eyes.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.880]   You don't want sunglasses on during this period
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.000]   in the morning, hats, any of those things
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.520]   that could obstruct that sunlight.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.240]   You want it to go directly into your eyes,
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.720]   which is connected to that super chiasmatic nucleus.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.640]   And that super chiasmatic nucleus
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.640]   is kind of that master clock
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.640]   that then's communicating to all of these peripheral clocks
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.080]   in virtually every cell and organ in our body.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:42.080]   So trillions of clocks that are looking to help stay on time
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.720]   and facilitate the workability of your sleep-wake cycle
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.320]   among many other things.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.200]   But if you don't get that signaling process,
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.440]   particularly in the first half of your day,
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.120]   so our ideal would be,
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:54.960]   'cause I know some people are like,
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.360]   well, I don't have a lot of time, where do I put it?
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.040]   At least beginning with that first early morning piece.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.680]   So when you first get up,
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.320]   our philosophy is kind of like get up and out.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.640]   So you wanna get up and out of bed,
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.800]   but outside, so the dog walkers and all the things
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.080]   are really winning the day here,
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.480]   the people that have reasons to bring their animals
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.680]   or pets outside or what have you.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.240]   But even, so whatever's going on in your life,
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.640]   if you can set yourself up to get out there,
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.160]   that will make such a huge difference
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.960]   for then resetting this master clock.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.880]   And then it creates almost this invisible countdown
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:31.520]   to when you're gonna get sleepy in the evening,
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.440]   16 hours or so later into the night
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.280]   of when you'll be developing more melatonin in the evening.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.480]   So they're connected.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.960]   - So this morning, I just looked,
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.520]   San Francisco, sunrise, 6.49.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.120]   I was up before 6.49.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.880]   If I get up at six, is there a benefit to going outside
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.360]   when it's not bright yet?
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.800]   Or should I really be waiting until the sun is out
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.560]   and it's a bright day to go outside?
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.000]   - Yeah, so it's a very good question.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.200]   Because for a lot of people,
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.880]   then there's a reality of life.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.560]   They've got circumstances, they've got kids,
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.440]   they've got jobs, they've got whatever.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.400]   So what do you do when you're waking up
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.880]   before the sun is rising?
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.280]   Well, there's kind of a couple camps
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.960]   that have been emerging on this.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:14.680]   So one from sort of a scientific circadian perspective,
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.440]   a lot of the recommendation will be,
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.920]   all right, well, if that's the case,
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.400]   then you can use faux interventions.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.280]   So you can use like sad lamps and things that,
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.800]   so seasonal affective disorder lamps,
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.360]   really bright lights, bright blue lights.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.400]   So the time when we would be potentially
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.080]   cultivating more blue light would be in the morning.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.720]   And so that would be the suggestion from that camp,
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.760]   is getting as much of that blue light in your eyes
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.280]   as possible in the morning.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.720]   Now, kind of more, if you'll say like
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:47.040]   ancestral health proponents will instead point to
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:51.000]   in the morning versus getting all that bright light
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.960]   and kind of the activity that that would be,
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.120]   if you can still align with the rhythms of nature
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.440]   and use a red light during that time,
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.960]   that would be the suggestion of this emerging kind of camp,
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.960]   is to then wait till you are getting outside
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.480]   to get that natural light and truly syncing up
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.040]   with those rhythms of nature.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.200]   Now, my suggestion on that is,
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.280]   if you are able to align with these rhythms,
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.520]   that's always preferable.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.000]   We did that for thousands of years.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.160]   Edison only came up with the light bulb
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.080]   about 144 years ago.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.920]   So we have this kind of recency bias
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.160]   where we think that this is just always how it's been,
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.600]   but in the span of human history,
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.040]   this is a very new phenomenon
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.880]   that we can even do these sort of things.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.520]   So if you are leaning towards
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.640]   and have the ability to create your schedule in such a way,
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.480]   that could be great.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.560]   So you could perfectly kind of align with those rhythms.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.840]   But if you cannot, which I have plenty of clients who can't,
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.120]   then you could lean into technology
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.080]   to kind of help wake you up
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.360]   at the times that you are needing to get up.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.640]   - With the right lights in the room and that kind of stuff.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.480]   - Exactly.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.280]   There's even like glasses that are being created
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.480]   that will have blue lights that will shoot right into yours.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.080]   So you could be, you know, making breakfast,
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:00.920]   doing whatever you need,
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.400]   and then you can be kind of, you know, Star Trek-esque.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.960]   - Okay, so that's lighting.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.920]   What about what's in the room?
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.040]   You know, your mattress, your pillows,
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.160]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.440]   - Okay, so one of my biggest suggestions,
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.640]   'cause after light/dark is temperature
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.160]   being really important for your circadian health.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.120]   So for temperature,
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.760]   what a lot of people are missing the mark on
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.240]   is that they might know,
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.440]   yeah, we want to sleep in kind of cool environment,
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.480]   but they might not know to what degree
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.720]   and some of the things that are available.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.520]   So one, some of the suggestion out of the Sleep Foundation
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.320]   is in the realm of around 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.200]   for ambient sleep temperature,
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:46.120]   which many people I speak with are not in that range.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.760]   So even just beginning there,
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.600]   and of course,
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.760]   we don't want this to be massively uncomfortable for you.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.400]   So play with this accordingly.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.760]   But I think people are often surprised,
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.960]   especially when they start tracking
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.080]   to see when they lower the ambient temperature
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.760]   that they often get better sleep results,
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.080]   less sleep fragmentation, less wake-ups.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.680]   'Cause even if it's kind of a little chilly when you go in,
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.520]   then throughout the course of the night,
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.440]   you can benefit from that,
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.160]   especially when we're moving into REM
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.560]   and we start heating up the body.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.800]   And that's when often people might wake up
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:15.720]   'cause now they're hot
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.680]   and when they didn't go to bed hot.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.120]   But the other thing that I would definitely suggest
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.360]   if available to people,
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.640]   now this is a bit of an investment,
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:27.640]   but if it's on the table is a cooling mattress topper.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:32.640]   So like Chili, Sleep Me, Eight Sleep, Sleep Number,
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.000]   different companies that offer the ability
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.120]   to cool the mattress itself.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:37.960]   Why?
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.880]   Because historically we would have slept outside
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.920]   on the ground as part of our thinking
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.000]   or closer to the ground,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   which would have been part of the coolest part
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.040]   of our environment.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.840]   So even though it can sound newfangled and fancy,
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.440]   we're kind of mimicking how we assume
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:58.240]   we likely had slept for thousands of years previously.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.160]   So getting that cooling effect
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.760]   versus the kind of the cooking that can happen
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.680]   when we're in full mattresses
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.360]   covered with these heavy duvets
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.440]   and then have our own body temperature
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.000]   just in there for seven to nine hours
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.360]   throughout the whole course of the night.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:17.840]   And many of us are then waking up from that heat effect
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.360]   and that can be problematic.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.840]   Forgetting the technology,
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.280]   if you just assume you've got a mattress, no topper,
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.760]   and you could choose between,
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.720]   but if the room's too cold,
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.840]   you often need a lot of sheets and duvets,
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.560]   or you could leave the room a little warmer,
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.520]   but a top sheet is one of those paths better.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.400]   If you assume you need a temperature
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.920]   that you can comfortably sleep in.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.600]   Okay, so one, there's gonna be
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.320]   a bio-individual component to this
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.400]   'cause each person's gonna run cooler or hotter,
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.160]   so it will depend on you.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.680]   But I would begin with the most gentle process out of it.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:52.160]   So if you're usually sleeping at 72 degrees,
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.000]   then I would have you begin at say 67
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.600]   and see how are we faring with that.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.840]   'Cause we're not trying to freeze you
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.160]   out of your sleep results
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.280]   'cause that can be negatively impactful as well.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:09.280]   So we would begin at kind of the least, most impactful dose.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.480]   So you would start at around that 67,
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.200]   see how that affects you.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.960]   Now this is going to change depending on each individual.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.400]   So especially women of menstruating age,
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.520]   you might find different parts of your cycle,
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.360]   you're gonna be massively different on a temperature scale
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.800]   than you would be just two weeks prior
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.000]   if you're in luteal versus the beginning of your cycle.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.440]   So these things are not,
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.920]   I know we'd like to be able to say,
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.960]   oh yeah, well you just put it at 63
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.080]   and that's how it goes.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.960]   But it's not quite as,
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:43.240]   it doesn't quite work like that.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.120]   So instead, we wanna keep beginning
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.520]   at what can be comfortable for you
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.960]   and keep working your way back.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.240]   This is where trackers can really be helpful
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.320]   in the process too,
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.640]   to see how do you respond when you start like that.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.920]   - And when it comes to the environment in the bed,
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.360]   do you want, is more or less sheets better?
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:07.480]   - So I would say that what we're trying to do
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.160]   is a banana shape throughout the course of the night.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.600]   So basically, you're starting in
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.120]   when you're comfortably warm, right?
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.960]   And then we're helping to facilitate
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.080]   that we're cooling throughout the course of the night
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.040]   and facilitate that our body can be cool
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.360]   at some of those lower levels.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.960]   And then when you get into REM,
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.080]   you would be warming up into the early morning hours.
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:32.000]   So you might find that if you do have a wake up,
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.280]   that you might kind of take off one of those sheets
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.960]   throughout the course when you're going into REM.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.720]   That's perfectly natural and normal.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.480]   But it's not a static piece
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.320]   where you're just staying at the same temperature
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.440]   throughout the whole course of the night.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.440]   So it might adjust for you.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.480]   And what you ate, what time did you eat?
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.440]   Do you have alcohol?
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.360]   Do you have all these other things
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.960]   that might've impacted your body temperature?
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:00.200]   But traditionally, we usually want breathable materials
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.040]   in your bed.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:04.760]   So you want breathable sheets, breathable duvets.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.280]   You want mattresses that are not gonna trap heat
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.520]   'cause a lot of them are trapping that heat.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.760]   So you want the ability for this to not get stuck
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.920]   and kind of insulating you.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:17.640]   - Obviously, you mentioned the technology.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:18.480]   I'm a huge fan, right?
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.320]   I had an eight sleep.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.160]   I don't, I didn't have one.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.000]   I still have one.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.400]   I have an eight sleep.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.880]   It's been fantastic.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.080]   They've been a partner of the show.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.480]   So I haven't tried every product.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:30.040]   I imagine there are many products you can use.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.760]   I just happened to have an experience there
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.320]   that was good enough to reach out to them
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.160]   and work with them.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.520]   And it's very helpful when you're trying
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.800]   to do exactly what you described.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.880]   I would prefer to fall asleep a little warmer,
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.640]   but I'm okay sleeping a little cooler.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.720]   And for me to fall asleep, cool.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.520]   So this has been a good balance for me
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.000]   to have kind of a thin sheet on top,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.240]   stay warm, falling asleep.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.160]   So I've been a big fan.
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.240]   Everybody listening knows that allthehacks.com/8sleep
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:58.400]   and you can get a discount on the eight sleep cover.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.560]   So totally vouch on the technology.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:01.400]   What about pillows?
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.360]   How does the, or sleep position,
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.520]   you know, sleeping on your side, your stomach,
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.360]   all those kinds of things.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.560]   How does that affect sleep?
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.720]   Yeah, big deal.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.880]   Particularly for the prevalence of mouth breathing,
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.920]   we're seeing a lot of that
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.840]   throughout the course of the night.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:18.520]   And what position can kind of facilitate more of that
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:21.000]   is often sleeping on your back.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.800]   And so we're just trying to make sure
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.200]   that we're not mouth breathing.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.320]   That's one of our biggest concerns with sleep.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.800]   And so that can often spill over into rates of sleep apnea,
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.400]   upper airway resistance syndrome,
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.800]   which is much more prevalent than most people realize.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.080]   So our understanding,
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.240]   we just had an expert on the podcast at ENT
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:43.520]   that pointed to our estimations are globally
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.320]   about one in four people having sleep apnea.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:51.280]   And of that only about 10% of these insurances
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.480]   of sleep apnea being actually diagnosed.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:57.120]   So we're dealing with just a lot of people
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.880]   running around undiagnosed
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:02.880]   for some of these respiratory-based disorders.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.040]   So sleeping on your back can often
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.680]   be a big flare up for that.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.720]   So our opt-in recommendation for sleep
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:12.000]   is a side sleeping element 'cause we do see that
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.720]   when we're sleeping on our stomach,
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.920]   then that can sometimes mess with some of both our breathing
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.600]   and then of course, comfort and some of the other issues
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:24.080]   that might come up from spine positional piece.
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.160]   But if you're not dealing with,
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.480]   if you're just like amazing of a breather
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   and we're not dealing with that,
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.840]   then you could benefit from some of the elements
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.960]   of sleeping on your back.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.720]   If so, there's of course different types of pillows
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.920]   that you might bring in for each one of those
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.680]   side sleeping versus back sleeping.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.080]   - What about mouth tape?
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.680]   I'm not comfortable sleeping on my back.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.840]   If the goal is sleep on my back to prevent mouth breathing,
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.680]   could I just sleep on my stomach or my side
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.720]   and tape my mouth?
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:51.800]   - Great question.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:56.200]   No, it's so funny 'cause there's a bit of a,
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.640]   I guess you could say debate or this topic of sleep,
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.000]   this topic of mouth breathing in the sleep community
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.480]   has really flared up.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.720]   And there's a lot of concern that so many people now
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.000]   are starting to mouth tape.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.680]   And I can be such a fan of mouth taping,
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.200]   but I think here are the caveats.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.680]   And this is why a lot of the sleep community
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:15.760]   is upset about it.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.480]   Is that many people are just mouth taping
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:23.240]   and not taking the steps to get tested
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.280]   to make sure there's no respiratory based disturbances
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.120]   at play.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:30.440]   Because if you are, you truly are just band-aiding
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.360]   the problem to the point that it can actually make it worse
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.720]   in some cases.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.320]   If you do have sleep apnea, upper air resistance syndrome,
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.840]   some of the snoring, but that's not to say that one,
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.800]   if we clear that out, make sure that's not present
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.080]   and you're good to go,
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.360]   then that you couldn't benefit from mouth taping.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.160]   And it's also not to say that then if we discover
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.360]   you did an at-home sleep test, easy breezy,
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.680]   you find out you have one of these disorders,
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.040]   which are really prevalent,
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:00.000]   then can we use mouth tape to help
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.600]   with the treatment process
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.680]   that you're also being treated for this
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.040]   and using mouth tape.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.440]   You can absolutely do that as well.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.960]   But I think there's just a concern
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:12.880]   'cause some people are now just blindly taking these steps
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.720]   without knowing that they might be doing some harm.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:16.840]   - We can all buy these trackers
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.360]   and we're gonna get to technology in a little bit,
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.440]   but at what point does it make sense,
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.760]   or maybe high level, how much would it even cost
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.800]   to do some kind of more rigorous study on sleep,
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.440]   either at your home or in a lab?
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:30.920]   - So exciting that we're at a time
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.720]   where now you can be tested at home
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.760]   and for some pretty reasonable price points,
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.120]   even out of pocket.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.640]   So in the United States, there's a number of companies
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.920]   that you can be sent very quickly an at-home sleep test,
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:48.840]   often around $200 or so out of pocket
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.480]   to be tested for some of these
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:53.640]   breathing-based sleep disorders,
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.680]   so these respiratory sleep disorders.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.680]   Now, if you think that you might have
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.520]   something more egregious, we wanna be checked
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.440]   as far as sleep stages are concerned,
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.800]   'cause again, to truly understand sleep stages,
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.080]   you really do wanna look at the brain
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.040]   and the brain activity.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.520]   And then if you're concerned about things
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.920]   like restless leg or other things, narcolepsy, et cetera,
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:15.280]   there might be a time and a place to go in lab.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:19.160]   But now, if you're looking at that respiratory piece,
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.320]   you can just get tested by companies
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:25.800]   like Lofta, Empower Sleep, other companies are available,
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:29.760]   no affiliation, but these can send you a medical device
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.280]   that you can test at night in the comfort of your own home,
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.640]   which is a big deal, 'cause many people feel like
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:38.480]   they can't sleep well in some of these facilities,
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.040]   and so this can be a nice option in between.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:44.600]   - And are these more for testing
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.560]   kind of sleep-related disorders,
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:50.280]   or could they be a more accurate version
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:51.360]   of using sleep trackers?
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.840]   Or if you're someone who's like, I sleep pretty well,
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:58.080]   but I'm certainly open to getting from a 90 to a 100,
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:00.320]   is the sleep study at home,
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.800]   is that gonna help in that department,
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:05.440]   or is it more diagnosing things?
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.280]   - Great question.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.120]   So there are some pieces of tech,
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:12.400]   like the Wesper is one that you can use
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.200]   literally as like a little patch,
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.000]   and that will give you some information,
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:16.920]   kind of an in-between.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:19.440]   It's not quite a consumer-grade tracker,
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.880]   it's not quite a at-home sleep test,
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.240]   but it's giving you more in-depth information,
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.520]   so that can glean some more information
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:27.960]   from something like that.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.120]   But the at-home sleep tests that are gonna give you
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.200]   a kind of medical stamp of approval of saying,
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.320]   okay, yes, it does appear that you do have
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:38.640]   sleep apnea, for example.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.240]   If that's the case, then you're only gonna test
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.880]   for most of them one or two nights,
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:45.800]   most of the time, a couple nights max.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.700]   And out of that, if we do come back
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:50.480]   with some disorders present,
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.800]   that is gonna totally ripple into your results
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.920]   with your sleep trackers to go from whatever,
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:00.280]   the 80s to the high 90s, or whatever,
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.840]   in certain periods of time.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.320]   And it won't be the whole story,
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.280]   but it will certainly help support
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.520]   the improvement of those stats.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.040]   And to clarify, you won't always just be getting 90s
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:13.040]   or something, I don't wanna misspeak for people
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.280]   that might think the minute you get diagnosed
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.080]   with sleep apnea or something, settle and treat it,
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.800]   then you're gonna skyrocket,
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.440]   but it's gonna be a big piece of the puzzle.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.840]   - Let's go on to food, and let's also include drinking,
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.960]   probably has a huge impact on sleep.
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:26.800]   - Absolutely.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:30.680]   It's one of the more fascinating areas I find,
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.600]   and one of the more challenging areas
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:35.800]   for a lot of people to make this lasting change.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.040]   What would this change look like?
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.440]   Well, one, you can understand something known
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.480]   as circadian rhythm intermittent fasting.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.840]   And this is just a fancy series of words
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:49.400]   that basically means that we're looking to eat largely
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:53.520]   when the sun is out, and largely provide a bit
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:57.000]   of that digestive break in the evening when it's dark out.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.400]   Now, this is not to lose your mind over,
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.240]   because of course, there are certain periods of time
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:05.000]   when you will be eating when it's dark out.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.600]   So we're just looking to kind of cluster
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:12.320]   a lot of your eating time closer to these rhythms of nature.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.880]   And this is what we would have done for so many years.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.720]   So how can we bring this into our modern society?
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:21.120]   Right now, a lot of the research on this
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:25.120]   is coming out of the Salk Institute, Dr. Sachin Panda.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.880]   We did a fascinating podcast episode with him,
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:29.520]   and highly suggest checking that out
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:30.920]   if you wanna learn more.
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:34.240]   But what I would say about the takeaways with that
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:37.320]   is that his finding after decades of research,
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.920]   lots of great books, et cetera,
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:43.000]   is that bare minimum, the last bite of food you have,
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.640]   you're having that about three hours before bed.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:50.800]   Now, I'll also say that we also find even just
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.000]   on the ground from a lot of wearable data,
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.640]   some benefits for people even going a bit further than that.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:59.240]   So this is more in the anecdotal clinical setting.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:03.800]   But if we look at things like four to five hours
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.520]   before bed experimentation with that,
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.000]   your last bite of food,
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.600]   often we see things like heart rate go down,
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:14.560]   HRV go up, changes in body temperature, blood oxygen,
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.480]   of course, your instances of sleep apnea.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:19.400]   'Cause we know that if you are having
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:23.080]   any respiratory based issues or mouth breathing, et cetera,
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.080]   that some of these things can flare up
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:27.400]   if you're eating too close to bed.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.440]   So that would be the big takeaway
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.480]   is just minding those evenings
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:34.200]   and giving yourself some break.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:38.120]   Because unfortunately, many people that we look at
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.440]   are now eating most of their day
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:42.960]   from when they first wake up to when they're going to bed,
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.040]   not too much before that.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.280]   So this is problematic.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.360]   - Any particular foods to avoid
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.880]   either at different times of the day or all together?
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:56.040]   - Yeah, so there's a reason that we so often
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:58.840]   have people wearing continuous glucose monitors,
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.320]   because one of the more common reasons
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:04.520]   that people are having wake ups in the middle of the night,
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:08.720]   if it's not a sleep disorder or for outside of anxiety
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:11.920]   and depression and other things, it can get more layered.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:16.040]   But a very common reason is blood sugar instability.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:19.440]   So we're looking to find, to bring in foods
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.840]   that are gonna help support kind of a healthy,
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.600]   where they fall in the glycemic index.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:27.600]   Can we have something that's not gonna massively spike us
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:28.760]   throughout the course of the day
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.040]   and then have a subsequent crash?
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.400]   Because how we're managing our days
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.480]   often gets mirrored in our nights in many regards,
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.800]   but that is not excluded with blood sugar.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.920]   So that would be one of the areas
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.120]   that you can both measurably see to the point
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:48.240]   that many companies are now even integrating
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:50.840]   with companies like Oura or Whoop.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:54.000]   But we can say things like Vari is a company
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.560]   that integrates with Oura now
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:58.080]   so that you can overlay your sleep data
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.400]   and then see, oh, look, I crashed at 3 a.m.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:03.320]   and I also had a wake up.
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.360]   So you can start to correlate some of those things
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:07.200]   that are very much connected.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.640]   So that would be one place to begin.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:12.840]   And of course, inflammatory foods that you're having,
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.760]   so that can impact the airway
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.080]   and kind of the size of the airway.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:21.160]   We're looking to avoid things like coarse sugars.
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:24.240]   So we'll see people just go on some of these
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.480]   kind of sugar cleanses or Whole30
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.320]   or all these different things that people do.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.160]   And it will visually even look different
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:33.920]   in their sleep results in those sections of time
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.240]   when they do change their diet type,
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:38.680]   even aside from diet timing.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:41.560]   But if you look at management of both,
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.680]   the timing and the type of food,
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.720]   then you can often get a real change in your sleep.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.600]   And to the point that I have seen reliably,
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.320]   people even having things like changes
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:55.760]   in up to around 10 beats per minute in the heart rate,
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.520]   just in a relatively quick period of time
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.480]   just by moving the timing.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:02.120]   So their heart rate going down markedly
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.600]   just by moving that timing of that type of food.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.680]   And then of course, if they change the type of food as well,
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.400]   that can also be augmented.
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:12.760]   - Are there any foods that you would encourage people
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.320]   to add to their day or their evenings
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:17.000]   or anything to encourage sleep?
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.440]   - Yeah, so now this can get into lots of different topics
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:24.560]   on kind of food wars of protein versus,
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.960]   what are our macros or what have you.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.960]   But I will say that a couple things to think of.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:31.880]   One, checking in on your choline,
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.160]   the amount of choline you're having
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:36.120]   and how that can play a role in things like your REM.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:39.120]   So quality of REM, the duration of REM.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.480]   - What's choline?
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.760]   - Choline can be both supplemental,
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:46.720]   but also in things like eggs and certain meats
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.360]   and certain things that you can be aware of.
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.640]   We wanna be getting choline.
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:52.200]   And if you're not getting that in your diet,
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.800]   if that doesn't apply to you,
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:56.080]   then we might wanna supplement for some of those things.
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:59.040]   Now, of course, this is just one piece of the puzzle.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.160]   So I don't want people to feel like
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.320]   they need to immediately go out and supplement,
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:06.640]   but being aware that some of these nutritional items
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:10.240]   are so important for our sleep quality.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.160]   So the most basic is that if we're looking,
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.120]   we wanna avoid things that are gonna spike us highly.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.360]   So going, if you even Google the glycemic index
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.080]   and go on the things that are gonna be
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.520]   the most spike heavy,
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.880]   we wanna be kind of mindful of those
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.960]   because those are gonna show up in those sleep results.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.480]   And they also, if we're eating too close to bedtime,
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.080]   then that temperature spike can often go up
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.600]   and that can be counterproductive
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.440]   to helping us guide off to sleep.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.240]   'Cause you wanna remember that we're looking
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.680]   to set up our evening so that we're dropping
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.080]   our body temperature quite markedly
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.800]   in order to facilitate melatonin production
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.520]   and sleep onset.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.000]   But if you're eating late and the types of foods
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.600]   that are gonna be kind of upping your body temperature,
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.120]   that like those high glycemic load and what have you,
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.240]   then it can make your body temperature too high
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:09.280]   and that can be troublesome to fall asleep.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.520]   - What about drinks?
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:14.000]   I know caffeine and alcohol kind of have a huge impact
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.880]   on sleep, what's the concise advice there?
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.120]   - Okay, so this goes under the umbrella
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.120]   of chronopharmacology, the timing of your drugs.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.800]   So where are you gonna put your drugs?
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.720]   Caffeine, we would like to keep on the first half
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.240]   of your day knowing that there's bioindividuality.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.840]   Some people are slow or fast metabolizers.
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:37.920]   So if it takes you a long time to metabolize that,
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.040]   then you might wanna be aware
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.040]   and move it a bit earlier in your day.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.360]   So what could that look like?
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.640]   So for some people, I find them,
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.880]   we try to put it before around 12 p.m.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.760]   This is generalized depending on your sleep-wake schedule,
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.840]   but for most people, if you struggle to metabolize that.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.100]   For some people, they might be faster metabolizers
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:58.160]   and they can get away with a little bit later,
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.560]   something like 2 p.m. or so,
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.280]   'cause you have a bit more wiggle room.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:07.240]   But you wanna kind of check in also subjectively.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.240]   This is where the subject, you can both test with DNA,
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.280]   testing to see how fast or slow a metabolizer you are,
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.920]   but then the subjective assessment of,
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:20.220]   are you more sensitive to and struggle to fall asleep
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.680]   when you have that higher amount of caffeine?
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.160]   So that would be on the caffeine piece.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.280]   For the alcohol piece, oh my goodness,
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:31.280]   this is the one where for most people with wearable data,
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.440]   that's one of the biggest takeaways they get
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:34.960]   is just how much they're impacted
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:39.160]   by even one drink or two drinks or what have you.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.800]   And even if you're not tracking,
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.540]   then you can likely have a sense
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.600]   that you're waking up differently
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.080]   after a night of a drink or two,
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.240]   if you have stretches,
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.400]   long enough stretches of time without those.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.400]   So the sad truth is that I very rarely see people
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.860]   be able to have alcohol
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:01.120]   and it not show up in your sleep results.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.960]   What that looks like is it typically improves sleep onset,
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:08.560]   but then, so it truly does often help people fall asleep
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.600]   in many studies, but then it falls all apart.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.440]   So then often we have a whole slew of sleep fragmentation.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.520]   You're hotter throughout that course of the night,
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.880]   so it can impact the type of sleep that you're getting.
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.120]   So it can just be a whole mess.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.080]   And similar to THC being another one
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.680]   that also seems to do something akin,
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.920]   so similar with often helping with falling asleep,
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.320]   but then the quality gets a little funky,
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.320]   but a little different on your readouts.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.200]   But certainly with alcohol, the earlier the better.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.680]   So if you can do things like happy hour,
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:45.600]   if you can do boozy brunches, any of these,
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.160]   that's truly one of the best ways to make it
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.600]   so that it's not hitting at your sleep so much.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.000]   But the truth is it is one of the lowest hanging fruits
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.880]   that you can have to take out of your rotation
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.120]   to improve your sleep.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.520]   - Okay, so we talked about food.
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.640]   Where does exercise fit into sleep?
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.480]   - Yeah, so exercise, if we think of our nature of exercise,
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.040]   one, any exercise for most people,
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.840]   'cause we know most people are not exercising
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.040]   and moving their body enough.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.220]   There's a lot of, some of the stats look at
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.600]   some of the average rates of even just steps per day,
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.760]   looking at somewhere in the realm
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.400]   around 3,000 steps per day.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.320]   This is a quote out of Dr. Sachin Panda.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.600]   So if we're somewhere in that realm of 3,000 steps or so,
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.840]   or just really sedentary lifestyle,
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:36.320]   we for sure wanna be prioritizing exercise in general,
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.020]   'cause we know that this makes such a difference
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.160]   for our sleep results.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.240]   If you wanna improve that sleep quality,
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.960]   exercise is a place to look.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.480]   If you're someone that is into stats
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.520]   and you wanna improve things like your HRV,
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.560]   heart rate variability,
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.840]   exercise is definitely a place to look.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.560]   But so first beginning there,
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:55.600]   so I don't wanna dissuade people from exercising,
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.320]   but the time can be helpful as well.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:03.080]   So some of the circadian kind of approach can be,
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.440]   can you get a little bit of movement in the morning,
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.880]   ideally outside in the sunlight,
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.440]   so a morning walk or what have you.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.880]   But then if you do have this available to yourself,
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.480]   you're stronger, so you're more physically intensive
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.640]   types of workouts later into the day
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:22.520]   when your body has had the opportunity to warm up a bit
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.440]   and have less of a risk of injury,
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:29.520]   you're kind of more able to be more cognitively intact
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.100]   to take on this task of exercising at that time
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:36.680]   is a theory around circadian entrainment.
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.600]   But please, if that does not work in your schedule,
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.080]   I don't want this to be a thing
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.940]   where well then I just don't work out
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:45.720]   because that is so not gonna serve us.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.840]   - What about things like a little bit of yoga
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.080]   before bedtime, is that, you know,
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.880]   does that fall in the same bucket as exercise?
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:56.560]   - Yes, so really good.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.080]   The type of exercise is a big deal
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.920]   and the environment of that exercise
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:01.880]   that you're having that in.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.860]   So if you're going and you're doing your yoga,
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.880]   but it's in a blue lit gym
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.920]   and it's gonna require that you're getting all amped up
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.880]   and this is like right before bed,
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.360]   this can be obviously kind of problematic
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.020]   because it's counter cues.
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.920]   We're looking to as much as possible guide the body
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.380]   on what we want it to be doing when.
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:25.400]   So I would put yoga, stretching,
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:29.040]   some of these things as light movement of the body
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.400]   that can have a bit more latitude of where you put it
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.140]   if you have it in a relaxing environment.
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:36.720]   So that can give you some space
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.720]   of like where you wanna put this in your day.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:42.520]   But things like HIIT, you know, CrossFit,
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.720]   you know, strength training, some of these things,
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.080]   then you might wanna be a bit more strategic
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.400]   on where you're putting this.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.680]   Also, if you're dealing with times in your life
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.360]   where you've got really, you're struggling
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.840]   with cortisol load and you might test for this.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.580]   So your cortisol pulse might be really high in the morning.
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:00.400]   You do something like a Dutch test or what have you.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.300]   That might be a time when you don't wanna then
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:06.600]   have a high cortisol, then fast, then have, you know,
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.160]   coffee and then work out in the first thing in the morning.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.320]   That just might be too much.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.060]   So this might be dynamic for you,
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:14.160]   depending on what's going on in your life.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.440]   - So for a lot of people, maybe with a partner that,
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.600]   you know, one of their routines was watch a show before bed.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.920]   If we're, obviously you could put on some blue,
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.240]   like glasses or something,
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.800]   or maybe watch on a laptop with a red profile,
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.320]   but are there some activities that you could maybe do
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:33.360]   with a partner before bed, you know, potentially,
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.440]   skip over yoga, 'cause we'll come to that after,
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.920]   that you could do before bed
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:40.760]   that might be more promotive of good sleep?
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.080]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.680]   So one, we have a lot of different things
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.680]   that we can do to down regulate.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:50.300]   Our whole goal in the evening is what are we doing
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:53.400]   in the hours leading up to help facilitate the brain
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.780]   coming out of this hyperactivity state
[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.720]   to just calming itself down,
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.760]   walking down those stairs of kind of hyperactivity
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.600]   of the brain.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:02.760]   So how can we do that?
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.660]   So one, we can change the environment.
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.560]   So whether that's music,
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.640]   whether that's the type of conversations we're engaging in,
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:13.680]   like massage, you know, kind of reflecting on our day
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.720]   and a gratitude exchanges,
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:19.720]   different things with our partner, the stretching piece,
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.320]   different things that can help facilitate,
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:24.360]   okay, we're gearing up for sleep.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.520]   Some people will bring in things like Theragun
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.600]   and you can, you know, do this with your partner,
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.840]   but how can you make this a family affair?
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.820]   And the answer is yes,
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.720]   the more we can kind of all be engaging in this, the better.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.600]   - And what about like playing cards?
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.200]   Where does that fall in the spectrum
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.640]   of like ramping down versus up?
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.520]   - That is a great question.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.840]   I have never gotten that before.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.640]   So as far as cards, so one, I mean,
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.860]   I work with a lot of poker players,
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:54.640]   so their type of card playing often is linked
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:57.200]   with heavy stress 'cause they might have millions
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.360]   on the line or what have you.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.840]   So for them, it's a certain type of, you know, game,
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.680]   but if you're just playing maybe Uno or something,
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.340]   it's a whole maybe lower risk.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:09.360]   So for that sort of engagement,
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:12.040]   what we think of even just from an ancestral perspective
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.640]   is the evenings were often meant for bonding,
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.880]   for connection, 'cause we know that loneliness
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.160]   and sleep are interconnected.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.120]   So anything that you can do to kind of bond
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:24.080]   with your partner, your tribe, your people,
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:27.240]   that seems to make sense that it can help support
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.000]   over time our results with our sleep.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.840]   So you just wanna check in periodically,
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.320]   like, are you super competitive
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.600]   and you're getting really stressed out
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:39.200]   at the end of this, you know, card game, you know,
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:42.320]   does this, could this be moved a little bit earlier?
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.400]   Do we need a bit more buffer time?
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.920]   So would we do this a bit earlier in our evening?
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.600]   And then maybe we add in some time
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.240]   to kind of wind down more with, you know,
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:53.120]   reading or something more low key.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.280]   But if it's something that's just a really joyous,
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:59.060]   you know, activity for you and doesn't bring about stress,
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:01.520]   then that could be a great activity to bring in.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.480]   - So does that mean if it's non-stressful
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.520]   but highly functioning in your brain,
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.540]   it could be okay, like a crossword puzzle?
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:12.080]   - Yeah, so the big thing is,
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.720]   is that particularly right up before sleep,
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:19.800]   we're just looking to not be too cognitively engaged.
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:22.280]   So your evenings are this whole wealth of time
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:26.760]   where you can, you know, set yourself up for more off time.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.160]   So we're not working
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:32.360]   and we're moving over into connection or relaxation.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:35.280]   But then I would say there is a bit of this buffer time
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.760]   before bed where you might not wanna just
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:40.240]   have the crossword puzzle in your bed.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.400]   We do often say that you're looking to,
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.760]   if you're selecting your reading material or what have you,
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.480]   that things that could just get you a little too worked up
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.600]   might take away from our goals.
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.520]   And so what that could look like is also, you know,
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.520]   things that excite you.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:57.840]   So that even you stress, like EU stress, excitement things,
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.520]   those can still be activating.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:03.160]   So we just wanna keep taking that inventory
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.840]   'cause maybe for some people,
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.120]   the crossword puzzle is sort of just this relaxing,
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.240]   low key down regulatory activity.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.400]   For other people, they're stressed out about it.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.320]   - Okay.
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.640]   So right, I wanna talk about technology
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.600]   and I have a couple of quick hits before then.
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.160]   So one is around kind of falling back asleep.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.120]   Are there any tips you have for people,
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.600]   both in the first stage of trying to fall asleep
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.800]   and the wake up stage?
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.880]   And what I'm gleaning from our conversation is,
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.960]   if you start optimizing all of these other things,
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.680]   you might not still have that problem.
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.520]   - Yes.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.480]   - But for the purposes of getting through this,
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:38.320]   every now and then, I would say I typically sleep well
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.480]   and we'll talk about my data,
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.800]   but sometimes I'll wake up, stuff's on my mind
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.640]   and I'm just like, oh, I just need to go back to sleep.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.000]   Are there any kind of, whether it's breathing
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.400]   or thought exercises that can help people
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:51.680]   who are struggling to fall asleep on a short-term basis
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.480]   that maybe don't need a study to figure out insomnia
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.880]   or some other condition?
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:56.800]   - Sure.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.800]   Okay, so you're waking up and hopefully you're kind of
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:00.680]   learning some of these things
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.600]   that we've been speaking about.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.600]   So over time, hopefully you have less and less of these,
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.880]   but in the meantime, you're having some wake ups.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.000]   What do you do?
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.840]   So you're waking up, a couple of things
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.840]   that we would practice is one, acceptance.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.260]   I know this can sound so light,
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:16.080]   but acceptance of the fact that you're up,
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.920]   because so many of us will fight and resist
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.320]   that we are awake at 3.20 a.m. and we don't wanna be.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.260]   And the more we start resisting this, why is this happening?
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:27.000]   Is there something wrong with me?
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.040]   Some sort of line of thought, this can wake you up
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.460]   more than we're looking to facilitate.
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:36.440]   So it sounds like a soft skill, but it becomes a real skill
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:41.440]   is to how to practice acceptance in the face of a reality
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.080]   that you might not like.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.720]   So one, practicing that.
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.880]   Two, if you are playing into it,
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.000]   you should know about something called CBTI,
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.280]   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia,
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:55.160]   'cause if you are struggling with staying asleep,
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.360]   you might benefit from some of those practices.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.280]   Check that out, we got lots of podcasts on that.
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:03.280]   But some of the rules of thumb there
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:06.640]   can be that if you are awake for a stretch of time,
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:10.560]   going outside the bedroom and doing something light
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.380]   and relaxing in dim lighting.
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:16.000]   I will say that that is one area
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   that I sometimes have some of my clients not abide by.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.800]   You can do that if that fits for you,
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.080]   if that's helping you and you do that
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.640]   until you're a little sleepy, great.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:30.440]   But it's also important to know that there is the option
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.680]   of kind of laying in a relaxed position.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:36.320]   You can do things like breath work.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.320]   If you want to bring in like meditations and other things,
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.880]   you can do that.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.560]   And if you have kind of dim lighting,
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.480]   so red lights or what have you,
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:51.960]   you can bring in things like reading, writing.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.960]   So writing out any of those stressors is a big suggestion.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:57.760]   So what that would look like is taking a piece of paper,
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.320]   have it always by your bed, little,
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.440]   I actually have pens that glow red.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.400]   So you can use that pen or a way to have dim lighting
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.440]   and have two columns.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.840]   And on the right hand side,
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:15.440]   you're putting in all of your problematic issues.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.620]   So anything that's coming up,
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.160]   you just kind of outline all of those things.
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.880]   And then on the other side,
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.080]   what you're doing is you're putting all of those solutions
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.360]   to those concerns.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.600]   And then even if there is no solution
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.480]   and you have to practice acceptance,
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.740]   you are doing that in that time.
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:39.820]   And so these different tools are ways to combat
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:42.080]   what is a really interesting piece
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.120]   is we just saw this recent study
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.920]   called the Mind After Midnight
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:48.720]   that showed that our thought patterns
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.960]   actually have a different way of behaving
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.080]   in the wee hours of the morning.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.280]   So we see rates of suicidality, anxiety,
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:00.800]   depression, all these other things go up in these wee hours.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.760]   So it can also be helpful for you to know
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.040]   that that is the case for most of us.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:08.560]   So you can be aware that you might not wanna believe
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.080]   some of the thoughts that are coming up in the same way
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:14.080]   that you might do throughout the rest of your day.
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:17.160]   - Yeah, my tactic has previously been
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.280]   to throw on a meditation,
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.960]   an audio kind of like guided sleep meditation.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.560]   Peloton has a ton of them.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.600]   I don't know if you're familiar.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.640]   Someone recently told me about the cognitive shuffle.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.120]   - Oh no, what's that?
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.120]   - Okay, so I'll encourage everyone to try this.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:30.960]   You too. - Okay.
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.440]   - If you fall asleep and you wake up
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.960]   in the middle of the night and you're trying to go to sleep.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.920]   So the way if I remember right that it worked
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.240]   is you pick a letter at random
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.400]   and you visualize a word that starts with that letter
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:46.000]   and then you take each letter in that word.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.920]   So let's say you say B and you say, you know, broomstick.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.000]   Man, that's too long.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.160]   Let's say blood.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:54.960]   And then you go B and then you just visualize B words
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:57.240]   until you're out and then you visualize L words
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:59.360]   and two O's doesn't really help.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.520]   But anyways, the idea is that you're just visualizing words
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.360]   and thinking about them.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.840]   So if the word was, you know, bat,
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.160]   you'd visualize a baseball bat
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.800]   and like kind of turn it around in your head
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:09.680]   and think about it.
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:12.480]   And then you'd move on to the next one and it's a bag
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.480]   and you visualize a bag and you imagine, you know,
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.480]   kind of like looking at it from all perspectives
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.560]   and thinking about it and, you know, imagining the word.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:22.640]   And the idea is it kind of puts your mind
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:24.760]   in this similar to a dream state
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.040]   and you just fall back asleep.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.600]   I've tried it once or twice and it's worked.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:28.920]   They swear by it.
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.000]   I haven't sworn to it,
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.160]   but that's one that I have heard that, you know,
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:35.120]   obviously not as good as just getting good sleep
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.040]   and not waking up.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.480]   But I will try to find a link and put it in the show notes.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.120]   That's one that I've been playing with.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.400]   The last in the kind of camp that I want to ask about
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.440]   is sleeping with a partner.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.640]   I feel like I haven't found great data on this,
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.080]   but like, how does that affect your sleep?
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.280]   What should you do if you do have a partner
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.560]   and one of you is sleeping well, maybe both of you aren't,
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:59.320]   what are best tips for people that share a bed?
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.320]   - So glad you asked that.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.960]   This is our number one most popular episode.
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.240]   And I would definitely suggest that people listen to this
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.280]   with Dr. Wendy Truxell.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.440]   And this is her whole area of focus.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.840]   And she has a book called "Sharing the Covers."
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.840]   And it's looking at sharing the bed
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:20.720]   with your significant other, kids, pets, et cetera,
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:23.680]   because we do see that that can be really disruptive,
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.640]   even if we think it's helpful.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:30.120]   So meaning that a lot of people will look at them,
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:34.280]   their sleep results, and their sleep is clearly impacted
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.160]   when they have this other partner or whoever in bed.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:40.840]   And then we have them sleep by themselves and it's better,
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.240]   but then you ask them and they say,
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.480]   "Oh, I always sleep better with my partner."
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.960]   So point being, I'm not saying that everyone needs
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.400]   to separate from their sleep environment.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.880]   Although what she's pointing to is called a,
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.200]   she's coining instead of a sleep divorce,
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.520]   a sleep alliance, nicer way to put it,
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.280]   so that you are during certain times
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.840]   when maybe you have different shifts that you're working
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.920]   or different schedules, or you're navigating treatment
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.560]   of things like sleep apnea, snoring, et cetera,
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:14.280]   or kids, dogs, maybe it's a temporary period of time
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.520]   that it can make sense.
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:17.880]   It's not like a failure to be in different rooms
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.240]   if that's available to you.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.400]   But the big takeaway is yes, your environment
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:26.120]   can really, really impact some of your sleep results,
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:27.080]   including the pets.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.560]   And actually there are high on the rank of things
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.440]   that can disrupt us over the long term,
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.120]   even more so than kids often,
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.720]   because they're usually around for longer in the bed
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.640]   than kids for just a few years, but pets for a long time.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:44.280]   So you want to take inventory and kind of audit
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:48.400]   what is going on with anyone else that's in your bedroom
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:51.720]   and really have some real conversations
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:56.600]   and look at this in a way that is pulling for a great sleep.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.000]   So if it's consistently not working,
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.840]   and some of these things are tricky to solve,
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.920]   restless leg syndrome, certainly we mentioned the snoring
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.840]   and other things that could keep people up.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.880]   So there's no shame if we do have to separate
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.920]   during those periods, but we want to be treating
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:18.920]   these problems if available to us very quickly
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.640]   with a lot, because it's not just a social disorder
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.160]   if we are having the snoring and sleep apnea,
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.520]   upper air resistance syndrome.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:30.200]   Otherwise it's impacting both the person
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.440]   that that's happening to and the partner.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.360]   - And I know for people who aren't having issues,
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:39.080]   I know even just like the mattress toppers,
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:39.920]   I know they ate sleep,
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.480]   like we could choose temperatures differently.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.600]   And so we started to make little changes,
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.440]   but we've got an episode.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:46.800]   I'll link to the episode in the show notes
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:47.920]   for people who want to go deeper.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:50.240]   And when it comes to these trackers,
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.240]   we've talked a lot about Aura,
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.520]   'cause that's the one I'm using
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.200]   and one you use with a lot of clients.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.240]   What do you think of the spectrum of trackers?
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:59.560]   And if someone's using a whoop or are there preferred ones,
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.080]   ones that are like just not good, don't buy the marketing?
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.600]   Or how do you think about that?
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.600]   - Yeah, so it's exciting.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.800]   I think it's a really exciting time
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:09.000]   that a lot of these can be so helpful
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.600]   to at least just get you some data
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.960]   outside of logging pen and paper,
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:16.520]   because so much can start to get illuminated.
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:21.520]   And things like Garmin, Whoop, BioStrap, Aura, Apple,
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:26.000]   some can be brain-based like Muse headbands,
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.120]   Dream used to be one.
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.360]   You can still kind of access that.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.160]   But so now you have access to different ways
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:34.960]   for tracking your sleep,
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.960]   in addition to things like Fitbit and some of the OG ones.
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:41.040]   So a lot of these are gonna be helpful bare minimum.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.480]   And for sleep in particular,
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.800]   there is a reason that for us still to this day
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:46.880]   for years and years,
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.440]   we've required that people have had the Aura ring
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.220]   to participate in our programs,
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:57.080]   just simply because as far as a sleep specified tracker,
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.560]   it does really shine in that area.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.120]   Now, of course, any consumer grade tracker
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:04.360]   has certain things that have those limitations.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.560]   We touched on the sleep stage classifications,
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.040]   which definitely have their shortcomings.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:14.920]   But there are things that we have a bit more weight in
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.040]   as far as its accuracy,
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:19.240]   like it's, are you awake or are you asleep?
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:24.080]   That tends to fall more and say like the 90% percentage rate
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.480]   of accuracy as far as,
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.040]   okay, we could probably guess that it's pretty accurate
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:29.880]   for the most part.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.880]   There might be some flaws here and there,
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:35.040]   but that's one of the reason we go with Aura,
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.080]   but we also, especially in recent years,
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:39.560]   have been starting to uptick our amount of
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.400]   working with people with the loop band.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.440]   So they're doing a lot of really cool things for sleep,
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:48.280]   even some cool stuff with like AI sleep coaching in there,
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.380]   which is really, really cool.
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:52.720]   So they're pulling your data and then they can say,
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.840]   oh, well, Chris, okay, well, let's look at your HRV
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:57.360]   and you had these trends for the last couple of months
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.080]   and here are some things you could do
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.520]   to improve these numbers, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.520]   So it's pulling with your actual data
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:08.880]   and then bringing from some of the latest in sleep science
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:11.680]   to provide practical application.
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:13.680]   So I think that's what we're gonna start seeing more of.
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:17.640]   And then in recent years, and this year in particular,
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:20.480]   we're seeing these daytime stress monitors
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.360]   link up more readily.
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:26.800]   So like HRV tracking and how stressed are you by day,
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.000]   'cause that can play a role
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.400]   in some of our sleep results by night.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.240]   - Wow, okay.
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.200]   So it sounds like with everything that's going on,
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.720]   both with technology and AI and data,
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:37.640]   we're gonna get a lot of cool stuff in the future.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.480]   - Yes.
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.300]   - I am really excited.
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:40.720]   Maybe we'll have an update.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:42.080]   We'll have a chat in a year or two
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.680]   and see where the whole world has evolved,
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.960]   or maybe even sooner.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.920]   But in the meantime, we've gone over so much stuff.
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.160]   I wanna make sure people know
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.120]   where they can stay on top of everything.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:55.200]   You're publishing, reading, sharing with the world.
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.400]   - Absolutely.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:00.680]   So at sleepisaskill.com, you can do a lot of things.
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:03.200]   So there you can take a sleep assessment
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.200]   to get some real-time kind of feedback
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.880]   on some things that you can do right away
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:09.540]   to improve your sleep.
[01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:12.140]   You can also go to free downloadable PDF
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:13.920]   on ways that you can optimize your bedroom.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.000]   We talked about some of these,
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   and there's 18 high-tech, low-tech things
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.120]   you can do on there.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:21.520]   And you can also sign up for our newsletter.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:24.400]   We love kind of newsletter interactions
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.640]   called Sleep Obsessions.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.200]   Goes out every Monday for over five years.
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:31.400]   So lots of readership there of people sharing
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:32.640]   what's happening for their sleep.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:35.400]   And so we give lots of tips on that,
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.760]   as well as our podcast.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.960]   But if you're really looking to dive in,
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.280]   then we have cohort groups
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:44.700]   that we require the Oura Ring to participate.
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:45.540]   But then through that,
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:48.600]   you're coming in with particular stats with your sleep,
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:51.280]   and you're leaving with a whole different set of stats
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:54.160]   at the end of those interventions.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.920]   So our commitment is really being able to help
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.560]   get us back in the driver's seat of our sleep
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.800]   so that we're not so mystified by it
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:04.480]   and hoping that it improves or what have you,
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.200]   and instead really getting at the core
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.180]   of what's going on there.
[01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:10.680]   And then on the lightest side of things,
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:12.480]   we also offer audits.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.440]   So we'll give wearable audits.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.080]   So kind of like what we did with you,
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.980]   but we would go much more in depth for a full hour
[01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:22.720]   just with that individual's data,
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:25.040]   and then set you up with particular things
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.520]   that you would be taking on for the next 90 days.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.200]   And then we'd auto trigger some things for you.
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.040]   So in 90 days,
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:33.720]   you send us screenshots of what you've done to improve.
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:36.040]   So hopefully we've seen actual measurable change,
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:38.640]   and we see a lot of really cool stuff for people
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.980]   when they start getting aware of what's going on
[01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:43.560]   with their stats and what they can do to make a difference.
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:44.640]   - That's amazing.
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.320]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.240]   I really appreciate it.
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.040]   I have so much to go work on.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:49.880]   - Yay!
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.440]   I hope that that is an exciting piece.
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:55.080]   And really the thing that I would like to leave
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.160]   is that my mission on the planet
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:59.680]   is to help support people with their sleep.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.520]   I really felt like when my sleep wasn't working,
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:07.520]   I felt like I was just losing my grasp on reality.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:10.960]   I felt like I was just so disempowered.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:15.960]   I couldn't function in a way that once I got up under that,
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:18.560]   it completely transformed my experience in my own life.
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.540]   And then now to be able to work with so many people,
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:24.040]   it's the most fulfilling thing on the planet.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:27.280]   So anytime I hear that, I get very excited.
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:30.280]   So please report back on what comes up.
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:31.120]   - I will.
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.120]   Thank you so much.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:32.960]   - Amazing.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:33.780]   Thank you.
