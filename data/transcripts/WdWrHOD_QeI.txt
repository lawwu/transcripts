[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.540]   We come now to a consideration of the words that are to be found in this first chapter
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.720]   of Paul's epistle to the Romans in verses 18 to 20.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.040]   Verses 18, 19 and 20.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.380]   For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:31.340]   of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness, because that which may be known of God is
[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.560]   manifest in them.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.580]   For God hath showed it unto them.
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.240]   For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:50.020]   by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godliness, so that they are without
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.600]   excuse.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.740]   Now we are still considering this fundamental statement which the apostle makes, which is
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:08.080]   that the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.320]   of men.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.180]   He has said that in order that he may tell them why he is so ready to preach the gospel
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.480]   and why he is so glad that there is a gospel.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.800]   It is because this wrath of God has been revealed.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.660]   And we have seen, you remember, that he says that this wrath of God has been revealed against
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.200]   sin for two main reasons.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.400]   The first is the character of sin.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.160]   Now we've been considering that.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.080]   It's ungodliness.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.640]   It is unrighteousness.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.020]   He just makes the statements here.
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.960]   In the remainder of the chapter he works it out and shows how this ungodliness has manifested
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.200]   itself and also how the unrighteousness has manifested itself.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:08.140]   But the first heading is that God has revealed his wrath against sin in the form of ungodliness
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.020]   and unrighteousness.
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.800]   But there is a second reason why God has manifested his wrath, and that is because of the utter
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.120]   inexcusability of sin.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:31.640]   Not only because sin is what it is, but because it is so entirely without any excuse whatsoever.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.440]   Now that's the theme to which we come this evening.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.000]   You remember that last week we emphasized particularly the importance of putting ungodliness
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.840]   before unrighteousness.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.520]   How that is done everywhere in the Bible, and how vitally important it is for us today,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.640]   in connection with evangelism and the whole preaching of the gospel, always to start with
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.520]   ungodliness and then go on to unrighteousness.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:11.120]   But now I say we come on to this question of the unutterable inexcusability of sin.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.360]   Now it is very important as we come to consider this, to remember that the apostle here in
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.320]   this general statement is speaking of the whole world.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.160]   He is speaking of Gentiles as well as of Jews.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.280]   It is a kind of universal charge.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.600]   Now then, again, he divides up this charge into two sections.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.920]   He's got two reasons for talking about the inexcusability of sin.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:56.160]   The first is this, that mankind cannot plead ignorance in these matters.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.920]   It cannot plead ignorance in the matter of ungodliness, it cannot plead ignorance in
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.680]   the matter of unrighteousness.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.720]   That is the first ground on which he shows that there is no plea and no excuse whatsoever
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.280]   for the sinfulness of mankind.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.560]   Now let me show you how he puts that.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.680]   He says here, you see, in this 18th verse, "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:30.000]   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.680]   I shall be showing in a moment that "hold" there means "hold down" or "restrain"
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.880]   the truth.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.760]   But what he's saying is, you see, that they are restraining the truth.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.960]   Well that implies that they know it.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.160]   You can't be restraining something which you don't know anything about.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:56.680]   So at once he has suggested that the truth was known to mankind and that deliberately
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.800]   they have been holding it down and restraining it.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.920]   Very well then, there's the first statement.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.520]   It is implied that they were aware of the truth.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.440]   Now it's important to remember here that when he talks about the truth, he is not thinking
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.800]   about the truth as we normally use it.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.180]   We talk about a man coming to the knowledge of the truth, and we mean by that the truth
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.760]   concerning salvation.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.620]   The apostle clearly doesn't mean that here, because he's dealing with something much
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.760]   more general, as I'm going to show you.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.960]   Very well, then it means the general truth about God, not the special truth concerning
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.620]   salvation from God.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.720]   Then he repeats this, you notice, in the 21st verse.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.800]   He says, "Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God."
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.840]   Very well, there was a time then when they knew him as God.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.120]   Mankind has this knowledge.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.440]   There's a second statement of it.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.240]   And again he says the same thing in the 28th verse.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.760]   And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, so you see they had the
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.760]   knowledge.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:23.080]   Well now here is a great, therefore, fundamental statement.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:32.800]   Mankind cannot plead ignorance in these matters, because it has this knowledge of God, and
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.880]   it has to hold it down and restrain it in order to be in its position in sin and in
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.200]   the whole blindness of sin.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   Very well, but the apostle not only tells us that men had this knowledge and still has
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:57.480]   this knowledge, but he tells us in detail how men has this knowledge.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.320]   And here we come to a very important statement.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.160]   He puts it like this, you remember, in the 19th verse.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:12.680]   He says, "Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath showed
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.720]   it unto them."
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.000]   Now this translation perhaps isn't quite as good when it says here in the authorised,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.960]   "that which may be known of God."
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.660]   It's too sweeping a statement that, and it isn't a strictly accurate translation.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:38.240]   What it really means is, "that which is known of God is available to them."
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:47.160]   Now here we are confronted by a statement that is very important at this present time
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.400]   in the whole world of theology.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.480]   For the last twenty years or so, in particular, indeed for the last twenty-five years, there
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:04.920]   has been a great discussion going on as to how much knowledge of God is possible to the
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.600]   natural men.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:13.840]   Those of you who are interested in theology and in doctrine, and in a more academic sense,
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:20.400]   I mean, will know very well that two of the leading theologians in the world today, men
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:27.360]   whose books are widely circulated and who certainly stand out more prominently in theology
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:34.000]   than any two men in the whole world, I refer to two Swiss professors, Karl Barth and Emil
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.280]   Brunner.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.400]   They have differed and disagreed on this particular question.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.240]   This is the whole problem of so-called natural theology.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.600]   And as I say, for those who are interested in theology, it is at this particular moment
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.400]   a matter of very great importance in that whole contention.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.160]   However, we don't want to go into that.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.800]   I merely say that in passing, because I rather want to give you an exposition of what the
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.120]   apostle says here.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.120]   How is this knowledge of God available to all men?
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.840]   That's his statement.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:18.600]   He says this is something which is universal, and that is why all men are without excuse
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.160]   if they are godless, if they are ungodly, and unrighteous.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.920]   How has God made this knowledge known?
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.400]   In what ways is it known?
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.120]   Well, the first thing he says is this.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:37.340]   "God," he says, "hath revealed it in them, because that which may be known of God is
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.400]   manifest in them."
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:49.960]   Now, here again is a very great statement, which I can put perhaps like this.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   There is a sense of God universally in mankind.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.520]   It doesn't matter where you go, it doesn't matter how primitive the tribe may be that
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:08.760]   you come across in the most remote parts of the world, you will never find a human being
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:15.480]   but that he's got within him a sense of a supreme being, a sense of God.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:21.760]   It's universal in the whole of human nature everywhere.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.720]   And it is a very important and very significant point.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:31.520]   Those of you who have read the Institutes of the Christian Religion by John Calvin,
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.600]   the so-called Calvin's Institutes, will remember how in the very first book he lays
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:41.360]   tremendous stress upon this, and it is very vital that we should do so.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:49.160]   And those anthropologists and research workers who have investigated this problem have produced
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.680]   this very vital bit of evidence.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:58.840]   The most primitive tribes amongst the Pygmies in Central Africa, in the heart of Africa,
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:05.580]   and the most primitive tribes like the Aborigines in Australia and in certain parts of the Northwest
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:12.200]   of the American continent where you get the most primitive people imaginable, even there,
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.360]   there is this sense of a supreme God.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.760]   It is universal in human nature.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.000]   Now even the man who tells you that he doesn't believe in God, who boasts of the fact that
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.800]   he's an atheist, even he's got a sense of God.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.720]   He's got to argue against it, and that's what he's doing.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.480]   Whether he likes it or not, he's got it, and he does his best to crown it and to ridicule
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.680]   it and to dismiss it, but it's still there.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:47.720]   A universal sense of God, that which may be known of God is manifest in them, deep within
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.840]   the consciousness of man's being.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:59.560]   And the second way, of course, in which this is manifest in us is in the conscience.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.520]   Now you get that particularly in verse 32.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.120]   I am in a sense giving you a general introduction to the whole of the remainder of the chapter.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.200]   Here it is in verse 32.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.040]   He's describing these unrighteous people, and this is how he puts it, "Who, knowing
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.440]   the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death."
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.760]   They know that.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:28.200]   They know the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:34.680]   only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.120]   Now that is a way of describing the conscience.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.560]   There is in mankind universally this sense of right and wrong, this feeling that sin
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:50.840]   deserves to be judged and that sin will be judged, and that this moral governor of the
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.600]   universe is righteous and just.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.200]   They know that.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:02.440]   But knowing the judgment of God, that's something that is in it in the whole of human
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.560]   nature, in the whole of mankind.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.360]   And that is why I'm stressing the importance of our remembering that the apostle here is
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:16.920]   speaking about Gentiles, the pagan races, as well as the Jews who have been given a
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.560]   special revelation.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.240]   So well, that's the first way in which God has given this knowledge.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.080]   It's in us.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.320]   It's in every man, everywhere.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.720]   It is the first reason for the inexcusability of sin.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.460]   But God has also given us this knowledge externally as well as internally.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.600]   This is the second form.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:46.360]   And here it is again explicitly in verse 20, "For the invisible things of him from the
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:54.040]   creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.560]   his eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse."
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.880]   That's the second reason.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.800]   Now what does this mean?
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:09.720]   Well here, of course, again, is another very vital bit of doctrine.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.080]   And as you and I, my friends, may talk to people who say they're not Christians and
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:19.520]   who don't believe in God, these statements are of tremendous importance.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.680]   This is the point at which you can make contact with such a person as you're having a discussion
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.760]   with him.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.320]   And it's important that we should know our case.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.560]   How has God given this external knowledge of himself?
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:41.120]   Well of course, he has done so, as the apostle puts it here, in nature, in creation.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.880]   He says this has been evident from the very creation of the world.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.880]   There are certain things that ought to be self-evident and obvious.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.440]   Now the best commentary on this, of course, is the portion of scripture I read just now
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:03.680]   out of the 147th Psalm, or that address of the apostle Paul in Lystra, quoted there in
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   the 14th chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:13.760]   There are tremendous statements of it towards the end of the book of Job, chapters 37, 38,
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.160]   and so on, where the whole thing is again put very plainly and clearly.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.920]   And they're worthy of careful consideration.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:29.600]   In other words, in creation as we see it, there are manifestations of the handiwork
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.600]   of God, the finger of God.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:38.080]   God has revealed himself in that way, in the sun and the moon and the stars and the
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:43.600]   animals, in the design and the order and the arrangement and the seasons, as the apostle
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.600]   puts it.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:54.320]   All these are just manifestations of God and of the fact of God.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:00.320]   And that is still a very vital and a very important argument.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.940]   And there is nothing which modern science claims to have discovered or produced which
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.200]   to the slightest extent invalidates this.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.680]   You see, you either believe that the whole of creation is just an accident, as a man
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:19.160]   like Professor Julian Huxley believes, or else you believe it's all been ordered and
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.560]   arranged and designed by God.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:28.760]   Now I shall come in a moment to tell you what the apostle says about that other view, that
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.280]   it's all pure accident and chance.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.240]   I think I've put it like this from this pulpit before.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.760]   Take something like the human eye, for instance.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.440]   So delicate, so subtle, so balanced.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.600]   We're asked to believe that all this has developed quite accidentally, that there's
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:52.080]   no mind, no creative mind or purpose, that there was no great designer.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.360]   It all just happened to come to be.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.000]   Nobody knows why.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.560]   That's what Paul refers to later on here when he uses the phrase, "They became vain
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.520]   in their imaginations."
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.320]   What else can you call it?
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.040]   But here he's putting it positively.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:18.080]   God has manifested himself in the work of creation, in all we see in nature round and
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.080]   about us.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.760]   Yes, but not only that.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:31.880]   God has revealed himself also in providence, in his arranging of things, in his providing
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.080]   for the animals and for men.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.800]   Now again, you get this very gloriously in many of the Psalms.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.720]   Read Psalm 104, for instance.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:48.160]   It puts it magnificently, wonderfully, how God provides for all the creatures and for
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:54.960]   the very trees themselves, sends the rain and the sun, and all along is taking care
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.280]   of the creation that he has brought into being.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.600]   Providence.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.120]   It reveals God.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.440]   And then the third thing, of course, is history.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:11.240]   The whole story of the world, the story of the nations.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.960]   You get it in the first eleven chapters of the book of Genesis.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:21.680]   As you read and look at secular history, outside the Bible, with the key provided by the first
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:27.760]   chapters, the eleven chapters of Genesis, you will see the same thing working on everywhere
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.280]   always.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.000]   In history.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:40.600]   God has revealed himself exactly as he has done in providence and in creation itself.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:47.640]   Now all these things, according to the apostle, constitute a revelation.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:53.760]   But it is very important that we should ask at this point, what sort of a revelation?
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.960]   What kind of revelation?
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.200]   And here, you see, we come across the importance of doctrine.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:08.120]   Because the theologians who derive their theology from the scriptures have always been careful
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.560]   to say this, that there are two main types of revelation.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:19.800]   One they call general revelation, the second they call special revelation.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.400]   Now we've got to draw that distinction here.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:29.720]   What is this revelation that God has thus given in creation, in providence, and in history?
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.760]   The answer is it is only a partial revelation.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.080]   And by partial I mean the general revelation.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.160]   Now the apostle uses an interesting phrase here.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:47.560]   He says the invisible things of him, of God, from the creation of the world are clearly
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.560]   seen.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.960]   What does he mean by the invisible things of God?
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:20:04.600]   Well obviously he cannot mean that creation and providence and history reveal everything
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.280]   that is true about God.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.400]   No man has seen God at any time.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.440]   God is invisible.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   But the apostle says the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.720]   clearly seen.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.680]   Does he mean by that that as I look at creation and providence and history, I will know everything
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.960]   that is to be known about God?
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.440]   Obviously he cannot mean that because no man is capable of knowing the whole truth about
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.320]   God.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.840]   God is incomprehensible to every man, even to the Christian man.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:43.000]   We don't know everything about God, for God is eternal in all his attributes and in
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.240]   his glorious being.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:51.080]   So he doesn't mean literally everything that is true about God has been revealed in
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.080]   these ways.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.140]   It can't mean that.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:01.840]   But you know it doesn't even mean that in these ways the truth about salvation has been
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.920]   revealed either.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.640]   The apostle isn't saying that.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.240]   And it's very important that we should be clear about this.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:14.800]   The apostle is not saying that in nature and in providence and in history you discover
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.440]   the whole of the truth about salvation.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.280]   He doesn't say that because he doesn't believe that.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:26.440]   The apostle, this same apostle himself, in this very epistle and still more clearly
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:32.920]   in the first epistle to the Corinthians in the first two chapters, makes it perfectly
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:42.120]   plain and clear that apart from the enlightenment given only by the Holy Spirit, the things
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:49.240]   belonging to salvation are not known and cannot be known to any man.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.640]   The natural man, he says, receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.440]   foolishness unto him, neither can he, because they are spiritually deserved.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.480]   Very well then, he is blind and he can't see.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.640]   But here the apostle says the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.320]   clearly seen.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.640]   So he doesn't refer to salvation here.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:19.000]   Man, natural man, man in sin by studying creation and providence and history will never arrive
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.720]   at a knowledge of salvation.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.200]   In other words, general revelation doesn't save us.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:32.040]   We need a special revelation in order to be saved, and God has given it.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.160]   Well what is the apostle saying here then?
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.480]   Well he puts it like this.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.720]   He himself, fortunately for us, gives the full explanation.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.560]   Listen.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:48.880]   For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.980]   by the things that are made.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.160]   What is it then?
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:58.320]   Even his eternal power and Godhead.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.320]   Very well.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:07.200]   When he talks about the invisible things of God, he is referring to God's eternal power
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.440]   and Godhead, and to nothing else.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:18.520]   He is not referring to God as he has revealed himself in salvation, but only to the power
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.880]   and the Godhead of God.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.840]   Now here again are two terms that we must define carefully.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.480]   The word power of course is simple.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.240]   We needn't bother about that.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.800]   You can't misunderstand that.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.960]   What he is saying is this.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:40.320]   That if you look at creation, you see the power of God.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.120]   Well look how that psalmist put it.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:46.340]   Who can stand before his cold?
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.000]   Look how he sends the snow like wool, and then look how he sends the sun and turns it
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.200]   into rivers.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.320]   What power!
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.360]   So that the next time there is a thunderstorm and you start by being frightened, remember
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:04.200]   these things and say, "Oh, the majesty and the power of God."
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   Look at the power.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.200]   Listen to the crash.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.200]   God's thunder.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.200]   God's explosion.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:17.900]   Which makes all our talk about atomic power sound almost like children playing, doesn't
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:18.900]   it?
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.900]   That's God's power.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:26.780]   He has revealed his power in creation and in providence, in the ordering of it all,
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:32.980]   and in the way he plays with nations who to him are but like the small dust of the balance.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.140]   There is the power of God.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.460]   As you see it in general revelation.
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:44.780]   But now this other word has been unfortunately translated here in this authorized version.
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:49.060]   Even his eternal power and Godhead.
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:56.060]   Now this should never have been translated Godhead, because Godhead really means God
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.900]   as God.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.300]   And that means the whole of God.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.900]   The person, the being of God.
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.060]   But that isn't what the apostle's talking about.
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.500]   And this is just sheer bad translation.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:12.700]   He deliberately used a word which should never have been translated as Godhead.
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.700]   What does it mean?
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.060]   It means deity.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.860]   It means divinity.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.940]   Even his eternal power and divinity, not his Godhead, because that's everything.
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.740]   But no, this is only partial.
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.620]   This is only one aspect of revelation.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.700]   This is the general aspect.
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:35.420]   And here it is that God shows his divinity.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.420]   What does this mean?
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:41.060]   Well, it means the divine excellence.
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:46.660]   It means the divine perfections, if you like.
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:53.420]   It means these particular attributes in God, in which he reveals not so much himself, his
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:26:03.340]   being, as his powers and attributes, his abilities, what the apostle Peter in his first epistles,
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:08.340]   chapter 2, verses 9 and 10, calls his virtues.
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:14.140]   That we may show forth the praises of him, or the virtues of him, the powers, the attributes,
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:20.700]   the excellencies of him, who hath called us out of darkness into his most marvelous light.
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.660]   That's the thing that the apostle is referring to here.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:31.500]   So that then we can summarize it and sum it up by putting it like this.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:40.380]   In creation and in providence and in history, there is not enough knowledge to save us.
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.620]   You won't find the love of God there.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.060]   You won't find the grace of God there.
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.060]   You won't find the mercy and the compassion of God there.
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:55.900]   But you will find his greatness, his glory, his majesty, his might, his dominion, his
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:00.340]   justice, his righteousness, yes, and his holiness in a measure.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:05.180]   Because here's this last verse, "Who, knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:12.260]   such things are worthy of death, that is revealed them."
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.460]   But it's nothing beyond that.
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.040]   So we can put it like this.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:27.020]   This general revelation that God has given and which remains is not enough to save men,
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:33.700]   but it is enough to render men inexcusable for his godlessness and for his sinfulness.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:40.580]   It is enough to render men inexcusable in the matter of ungodliness and of unrighteousness.
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:45.100]   Because says the apostle, there is enough there to be seen to establish the being of
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:53.620]   God, his greatness, his power, his justice, his rightness, his law.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:28:01.780]   In other words, his statement is that there is enough in creation and providence and history
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:09.860]   to establish the fact that God is the creator and that God is the moral governor of this
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.780]   universe.
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:19.620]   And that is why the apostle says that the whole of mankind is without excuse.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:28.060]   There without going any further, there is enough to establish God the creator.
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:36.180]   And God, I say, the moral governor of the entire universe.
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:42.420]   Now you see the importance of all this for preaching and for evangelism.
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:50.780]   The argument is that that is true of pagans, these gentile nations.
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.340]   Even they are without excuse, says the apostle.
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:29:00.740]   Very well, if they are without excuse in the light of this, how much more so the Jews to
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:06.340]   whom had been given special revelation, to whom God had come down and had spoken, to
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.660]   whom he had given laws, whom he had brought into being according to the counsel of his
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:16.660]   own will, to whom he had given kings and prophets and so on, all the special revelation of the
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.020]   Old Testament.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.580]   How much more are they without excuse?
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:27.660]   Oh yes, but we must go one step further.
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:34.180]   How much further are they without excuse who, in addition to general revelation and the
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:41.740]   whole story of the Jews, have got everything that is contained in the New Testament?
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:46.860]   Not only special revelation as given to the Jews, but the special revelation that has
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:55.060]   come in the face of Jesus Christ, the special revelation of the four gospels, with his life,
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:30:00.060]   his teaching, his death, his resurrection, the sending of the Holy Ghost, the story of
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.360]   the church.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:13.380]   If the apostle can argue that pagans who have been brought up in heathendom with polytheism
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:21.580]   and with idol worship, if even they are without excuse because of the evidence of God in creation
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:27.780]   and providence and history, how much more terrible and awful is the case of anybody
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:34.100]   brought up in this country, where the gospel has been preached for centuries, where the
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:40.300]   Bible is open, New Testament as well as old.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:48.660]   If these pagans in the time of the apostle were without excuse, I say how much more are
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:52.500]   men and women today without excuse.
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.780]   This is the apostle's method of evangelizing, you see.
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:31:00.940]   He brings home the case, the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.620]   and unrighteousness of men.
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:06.340]   They have had the knowledge, well, very well, what's the matter with them?
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:10.900]   Now then, that brings us to the next statement.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:15.300]   The trouble, says the apostle, is due to this.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:27.100]   And what renders them still more inexcusable is that they hold the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.860]   There it is, the truth is known to them.
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.500]   Well, why are they as they are?
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.540]   Well, they've held it in unrighteousness.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:39.180]   Well, now, we come to this word "hold."
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.700]   And there's often been a great deal of discussion about the exact meaning of this.
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:48.340]   There are some who say it means to hold, and to hold tightly, and to hold strongly, to
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.940]   hold on to.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.900]   And it does have that meaning.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:32:00.940]   But it also has the meaning of hold down, not to restrain, to hold back.
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.980]   And you really have to decide in terms of the context.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:08.700]   As so often happens, a mere knowledge of Greek doesn't help you at all.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.360]   It can be one or the other.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:15.180]   So you've got to decide by your understanding of doctrine and by the context.
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.640]   And so we do here.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:22.880]   And it seems to me that we must agree with the vast majority of authorities who say that
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:31.500]   it means to hold down, to suppress, to hold back, to fight against.
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:38.000]   So what the apostle is saying is that they have suppressed the truth in unrighteousness,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:46.400]   which means through their unrighteousness, or if you like, by means of their unrighteousness.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:51.660]   The thing that has made them suppress the truth is their unrighteousness.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:56.760]   They're not so much holding down the truth in an unrighteous manner, but because they're
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:01.680]   unrighteous, they're fighting against the truth, and suppressing it, and keeping it
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.680]   down.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.080]   They're doing so quite deliberately.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.320]   They're pushing it aside.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.920]   They're trying to dismiss it.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.440]   They're trying to twist it.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.120]   They're trying to explain it away.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.800]   They're doing everything they can.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   They can't help it.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.800]   It's in them.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   Their conscience is speaking.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.360]   The sense of God is there.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.000]   This sense of right and wrong, and yet they're as they are.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.760]   Well, they're fighting against this.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.280]   They're trying to throttle it and to drown it.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.040]   That's the unbeliever.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:35.760]   And that is why the apostle says that they're so utterly and entirely without excuse.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.840]   They've got the truth.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:42.040]   It's there in them, and they see it outside them, but they won't have it.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.600]   They deliberately are suppressing it.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:56.720]   Very well, there is the apostle's charge in general, and what a tremendous charge it
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.280]   is.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:05.320]   It's the position of everybody tonight who isn't a Christian, convicted of ungodliness
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.800]   and unrighteousness and without a single excuse.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.840]   The evidence is against them.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.680]   That's the evidence they'll face on the day of judgment.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.280]   You knew it.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:22.760]   You felt it even within you, and you deliberately suppressed it.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.520]   And they will be silent.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.240]   There will not be a word spoken.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.240]   There is no plea.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.920]   There is no mitigation.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:38.680]   And it is true of all men, even the most remote heathen, the most primitive pagan.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.080]   It's there.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:47.960]   But of course the moment we say that, this question arises in our minds, doesn't it?
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.040]   Why do men do this?
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.120]   Why should anybody behave like this?
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.680]   Why should anybody want to suppress this truth about God?
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:04.000]   Well, the apostle gives us the answer in these verses.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.320]   I've rearranged the order in which they appear here.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:14.440]   The apostle leads up to the last, which I'm going to put first.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:23.240]   The fundamental cause of all this is just pride, and pride of intellect.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:33.960]   Here it is in verse 22, "Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools."
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:39.520]   But here it is, you see, "Professing themselves to be wise."
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:43.000]   Men of intellect, men of understanding.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:51.920]   How contemporary this gospel is, this passage which we are looking at together.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.320]   This is still the trouble, isn't it?
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:59.440]   The average man today feels that somehow or another the hallmark of learning to be a really
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:03.080]   a twentieth century man is not to believe in God.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.040]   Pride, pride of intellect.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.000]   Of course it's always been the trouble.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.520]   It was the whole cause of the fall of Adam and Eve, wasn't it?
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.200]   It was this fatal desire to be as gods.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.640]   It was that they were ready to listen to the suggestion that really they were already like
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.640]   gods.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:26.400]   If they just turned their backs on God, they were capable of it, and the devil played on
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.400]   their pride.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.680]   He knew it was the one way to get men down.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.840]   He fawned to him and praised him.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.040]   He says, "It isn't fair to you.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.640]   You're too big for that."
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.000]   Pride, pride of intellect especially.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.200]   Down he goes.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.040]   So the apostle in writing to the Corinthians again in the first epistle, in the first
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:53.680]   chapter says, "Ye see, O calling brethren, how not many wise men after the flesh, not
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.480]   many noble are called."
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:04.080]   Pride of intellect, wisdom, knowledge, understanding, man with his great brain.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.120]   Religion, he says, is primitive.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.000]   I now am enlightened, I'm educated.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.880]   He's proud of himself.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.000]   Pride is the root cause always.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.560]   It always has been, it still is.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.400]   But the second thing is wickedness.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.280]   And here it is, listen to it.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:29.160]   Verse 21, "Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:35.440]   Neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations."
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.140]   Now we must translate that again.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:43.320]   It means foolish and wicked in their reasonings.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.500]   To be vain means to be foolish and wicked at the same time.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.600]   And imaginations really means reasonings.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:54.940]   It's most unfortunate that it should have been translated here, imagination.
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:59.020]   Of course, it's just the difference between Elizabethan English and modern English.
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.180]   They often used imagination in that sense then.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.620]   We don't any longer and therefore it's a bit misleading for us.
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.140]   So translate it like that.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:11.460]   "They became foolish and wicked in their reasonings."
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.980]   Or if you like, in their thoughts.
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:15.980]   What's he mean?
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.620]   Well, he means this.
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:25.740]   Instead of accepting that revelation which was there and with which man had started,
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:32.340]   they began to substitute their own ideas, their own thoughts, their own reasonings,
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:35.020]   their own surmisings.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:40.180]   In other words, you see, instead of accepting revelation, they became philosophers.
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.180]   And what is a philosopher?
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:45.940]   A philosopher is a man who says, "Well, I start by being skeptical about everything.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.300]   I'm an agnostic.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.900]   Now I'm going to have the data and then I'm going to apply my mind to them.
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.020]   I'm going to reason it out.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.740]   I'm going to work it out."
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.940]   And that's exactly what they've done.
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:02.500]   They became foolish and wicked in their reasonings, in their thoughts, in their own conjectures
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:07.740]   and speculations and surmisings.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.460]   And what's the cause of it all?
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:16.380]   He used the word "vain," and it means not only foolish, but it means wicked.
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:23.220]   And the cause of the whole trouble was wickedness, as it is still wickedness.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:28.460]   Why is it that any man alive this evening, instead of recognizing God as he's seen in
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:34.020]   creation and in history and in providence, and as he knows him in the conscience and
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:39.780]   in this general sense he's got of God, why is it that anybody, instead of saying, "Well,
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:46.220]   I believe in God and submit to him," why is it that instead of that he's a philosopher
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:51.580]   and boasting about his brain and his mind and his understanding and saying, "Oh, there
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:57.100]   is no God, and I believe that all things are happening as the result of energy or force
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.460]   with a capital F."
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.500]   That's the foolish imagination, you see.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.500]   Well, why is that?
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.980]   Well, there's only one answer.
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.780]   It's because man's wicked.
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:13.420]   It's because he doesn't like God.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:18.820]   It's because he knows that God is holy, and if he recognizes God, he's got a sense of
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.980]   guilt and condemnation, so he says, "There isn't a God."
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:26.100]   He knows that he wants to do certain things, and God says, "Thou shalt not."
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.620]   "Well, very well, what can I do?"
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:31.820]   "Well, I say there isn't a God, so that if there isn't a God, there are no Ten Commandments,
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.620]   and I can do what I like."
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:43.060]   Wickedness is the root, and it puts up its intellectual explanations in their vain reasonings,
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:47.300]   in their false and wicked philosophy.
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:55.140]   Man always tries to get rid of God because God is holy, and because he knows that if
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:41:02.540]   there is God, well, he's got to humble himself before him and be subservient to him.
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:13.060]   And the result of all this, as you see, is that man lends himself in his own utter futility.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:19.740]   I've already been referring to this futility, these vain reasonings, these monstrous and
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:23.500]   ridiculous philosophies.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.780]   These people say they don't believe in God, they can't believe in God because of their
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.700]   minds and reasons.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.900]   What do they believe then?
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.340]   Well, this sort of thing.
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.360]   I've often put it to you.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:41.180]   You go and ask them how the world has come into being, the cosmos, and they'll say,
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.740]   "Well, this is it.
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:46.540]   There was once two great planets."
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.700]   You say, "Where did they come from?"
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.980]   They say, "We don't know, but there were two planets."
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:55.220]   And then one day, nobody knows why, one of these passed a little bit too near the other,
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.640]   and in so doing it knocked a piece off the second.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:02.220]   That fell into space, hence our universe.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.580]   They believe that.
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.220]   That sounds quite rational.
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:13.460]   That is in accord with this gigantic brain of the modern man who can't believe in God.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:17.540]   You show him the order, spring, summer, autumn, winter.
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:22.980]   You show him the perfection of a flower which you've dissected, the perfection of the human
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:25.180]   frame or the frame of any animal.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:30.300]   You show him the whole order of creation.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:37.740]   He says it's all accident, all a matter of chance, no reason, no end, no objective, no
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.060]   purpose at all.
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:44.100]   I'm literally quoting, as I said just now, a man like Professor Julian Axley.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.020]   This is what they believe.
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:55.940]   It's not surprising the apostles called it vain reasoning, foolish and wicked, rejecting
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:02.700]   this perfect explanation for the sake of a philosophy.
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:09.300]   What man thinks about it all, there's only one word to use, it is vain.
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:15.220]   It's no God, it's nothing, it's confusion, it's chaos, and the whole future is equally
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:16.220]   uncertain.
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.700]   That's their position.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:22.940]   Let me say just a word about the last thing, which is, he says their foolish heart was
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.980]   darkened.
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.300]   And that again is a very important statement.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.860]   You see the sequence, you start with pride, and because of your pride you put revelation
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.400]   on one side and you put your ideas forward.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.180]   And you know what it leads to?
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.860]   It leads to this, your heart becomes darkened.
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.860]   What's the heart?
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:44.100]   Well the heart is the center of personality.
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:50.980]   That's translated in the scripture the mind, the very central citadel of man as a being.
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:54.740]   That becomes dark.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:55.940]   What's he mean by this?
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:59.900]   Well, let me put it in this form.
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:06.860]   As the result of these foolish speculations, as the result of the kind of life which he
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:14.420]   lives, man becomes destitute of spiritual understanding.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.260]   That's what it means.
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:24.780]   He becomes completely incapable of having an insight into divine truth.
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:29.300]   So that when the very son of God stands before him, he doesn't recognize him.
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.020]   He sees a carpenter only.
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:35.220]   The princes of this world did not know him, for had they known him they would not have
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.380]   crucified the Lord of Glory.
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:41.220]   But the natural man receiveth not his foolishness unto him.
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.340]   He's lost his spiritual sense.
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:47.340]   He's lost his spiritual insight and discrimination and understanding.
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:51.020]   His heart is darkened.
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:54.820]   All this apostle is very fond of saying this.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:59.460]   He says it perhaps more perfectly than anywhere else in the epistle to the Ephesians in the
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:03.060]   fourth chapter in verses 17, 18 and 19.
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.060]   Listen to this.
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:09.260]   "This I say therefore and testify in the Lord that he henceforth walk not as other
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:16.660]   Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkened, being alienated
[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:21.820]   from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:28.180]   of their heart, who being past feeling, have given themselves over unto lasciviousness,
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:31.580]   to work all uncleanness with greediness."
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:35.260]   There's a summary of the remainder of this chapter.
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:39.260]   But it's again in the fifth chapter of Ephesians in the eighth verse.
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:51.660]   "For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord."
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:58.380]   Their foolish heart was darkened.
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:12.420]   The rake's progress, pride, conceit, speculation, having rejected revelation, and the darkness
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:26.300]   spiritually, the inability to recognize the Son of God and the glories of salvation.
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.340]   That is man.
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.820]   That is what he's done.
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:39.860]   That's why he holds down the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:49.180]   And there is only one hope for him, and that is that he should come to say this, "Oh,
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:47:01.260]   how can I, whose native sphere is dark, whose mind is dim, before the ineffable appear,
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:08.060]   and on my naked spirit bear that uncreated being?"
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:15.940]   And then go on to say, "There is a way for men to rise to that sublime abode, an
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:24.820]   offering and a sacrifice, the Holy Spirit's energies, and advocate with God."
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.340]   The darkness is appalling.
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:29.100]   It's the darkness of death.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:32.700]   Their foolish heart was darkened, and there's only one hope.
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:43.500]   It's this gospel, the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:53.940]   shining into that dark heart, and causing the philosophies and the vain speculations
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:48:05.260]   to be dissipated and disappear, and to look in Christ as a little child in humility, into
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.740]   the face of God.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.060]   Amen.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:21.940]   O Lord our God, we have seen together the havoc wrought by sin, and we acknowledge,
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:31.180]   O God, that there is no excuse for ungodliness or unrighteousness in the light of the knowledge
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:40.580]   that thou hast given so clearly; O we bless and praise thy name, that while we were dead
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:49.860]   in sins thou didst quicken us together with Christ, and raise us up together with him,
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:55.420]   and cause us to be seated with him in the heavenly places.
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:49:04.180]   We bless thy name for the light of the knowledge of thy glory in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:15.740]   O God, have mercy upon all who still are in this darkness and death of sin, blinded by
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:28.820]   their own pride and conceit, fooled by their own vain reasonings and janglings and speculations.
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:37.500]   God have mercy upon them, and grant that there may be light.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:45.300]   Now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:51.580]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide with us now this night, throughout the remainder
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:50:03.100]   of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall see God
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:07.060]   and be with him in glory.
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:08.740]   Amen.
